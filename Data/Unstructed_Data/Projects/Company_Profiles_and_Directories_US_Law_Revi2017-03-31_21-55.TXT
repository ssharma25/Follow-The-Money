Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Alberta okay brings oil sands plant closer

BYLINE: (CP)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 242 words

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta


   CALGARY (CP) - A $4-billion project is closer to construction after the
Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board recommended approval of Syncrude
Canada Ltd.'s plan to expand its Fort McMurray oilsands plant.

The recommendation clears a hurdle from the path of a development forecast to
employ up to 7,000 construction tradesmen and create 1,400 permanent plant
operating jobs.

The board's report is expected to be released next week in a high-profile
announcement by the provincial cabinet, which has final say on the project but
is also a part-owner of Syncrude and a keen backer of the expansion plan.

Special agency

The recommendation follows about 15 months of extensive studies by the Syncrude
Expansion Review Group, a special agency set up to review environmental,
technical and community issues posed by the project.

Along with the conservation board, the group included company officials, the
region's Fort MacKay Indian band and representatives of the Environment
Department and the Forestry, Lands and Wildlife Department.

The cabinet is not being urged to put special conditions on the Syncrude
approval, although monitoring is anticipated for emissions, land-surface
disturbances and social effects of the giant project.

The development would raise production by the combination strip-mining and
bitumen-upgrading complex to 230,000 barrels daily, or more than 16 per cent of
Canada's total output.

Oil-spill tip line aims to shine light on issue; Landowners, environmentalists
join forces to document impact

BYLINE: Marty Klinkenberg, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 431 words


Weeks after the provincial government rejected a request for an independent
review of pipeline safety, a telephone tip line was set up by landowners and
environmental groups on Monday to allow the public to anonymously report oil
spills.

Volunteers from Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the Council of Canadians and the
Alberta Surface Rights Group will monitor the phones and collect the information
in an attempt to detail the frequency of pipeline incidents.

A coalition of 17 organizations asked Premier Alison Redford for an inquiry last
month after nearly 10,000 barrels of oil was spilled onto private land and into
a reservoir as a result of three separate pipeline breaks. Redford deferred a
decision until an investigation was completed by the province's Energy Resources
Conservation Board.

"When the premier failed to act after the three oil spills, we felt we needed to
take this step," said Mike Hudema, the Edmonton-based spokesman for Greenpeace
Canada. "With this tip line, every person can be a watchdog and be part of the
solution. Our hope is to get enough reports that the government won't have any
other choice than to launch an independent review."

Industry spokesmen and government officials insist Alberta's network of nearly
400,000 kilometres of pipeline is safe, but comparative data supporting that is
hard to come by.

The province does not keep a single list or map of pipeline leaks, and annual
reports from the Energy Resources Conservation Board outline the causes of
failures but provide no breakdown of costs to clean up leaks or the impacts on
water, land or wildlife.

In 2010, the board documented 687 pipeline failures, with 18 categorized as full
ruptures .

Chelsea Flook, the interim director of the Sierra Club's Prairie Chapter, said
the government's response has been insufficient.

"We need a review as soon as possible," she said. "It's broad spectrum issue. It
shouldn't be a partisan issue."

The provincial government and the Energy Resources Conservation Board already
have environmental accident tip lines, but Flook said she has heard complaints
from callers who felt they were ignored.

Hudema said one goal is to heighten awareness. Advertisements were placed in
newspapers on Monday to advertise the tip line all in communities with
substantial energy infrastructure.

"We want people to be our eyes and ears," Hudema said. "Often, when a spill
occurs, government and industry say there has been no environmental impact. We
want people to assess for themselves whether that is true or not."

The tip line is 18552377455.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical

California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.

Nikkei up despite sanction threat

TOKYO (Reuter) --Tokyo stocks closed moderately higher Wednesday despite the
threat of U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.

The 225-share Nikkei average ended up 82.45 points, or 0.50 per cent, at
16,471.35.

Japan asks for more car talks

GENEVA (Reuter) -- Japan asked the United States Wednesday to enter into urgent
talks to resolve their car dispute, arguing that sanctions already announced by
Washington violate international trade rules.

The Japanese government said the U.S. administration is acting as both
"prosecutor and judge" in the case.

Under WTO rules, Washington has 10 days to say whether it agrees to the
consultations.

Moody's downgrades Montreal

MONTREAL (CP) -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded to A2 the A1 debt
rating Montreal has managed to hang on to for eight years despite a real estate
crash in 1992 and the ravages of a recession.

Moody's said the city is focusing too much on lowering taxes without
compensating with cuts to spending.

That will make it tough to balance next year's budget and reduce the city's
flexibility, the firm said.

ERCB vet named to new board

A 24-year employee of the Energy Resources Conservation Board was named
Wednesday to the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, which was created this year
when the ERCB and the Public Utilities Board were merged.

Jim Dilay, who most recently was the ERCB's executive manager of operations,
becomes a board member June 1.

Three board members -- Jim Dunstan, Ralph Evans and Guy Berndtsson -- retire
this year. That will leave the board with nine members, including four each from
the former PUB and ERCB and chairwoman Celine Belanger.

The board also announced Wednesday that Lorne Fredlund, who spent 15 years in
senior positions with the ERCB, has been named chief operating officer of the
energy and utilities board.

WHALE OF A DECISION

SECTION: LETTER; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 223 words


Re "Board's move saves Alberta area from development," Vicki Barnett, Herald,
Sept. 9.

A pat on the back to a government agency? "Ludicrous," my friends might say.

In some circles it's a sure way to get "told off" as my mom would say. Who cares
what others think.

I believe that the Energy Resources and Conservation Board deserves a public
salute for its recent decision to refuse Amoco the permission to drill wells in
the Whaleback region.

Through reading and other resources I've come to realize how beautiful, unique
and valuable the Whaleback is to us Albertans.

Its greatest value by a long shot is as a pure, ecological region, undefiled by
development. Not as Amoco would have it, crisscrossed by road scars and pipeline
rights of way, dotted with well sites and compressor stations.

I realize that the issue is far from over, but the ERCB needs to know there is
at least one average person in Alberta who is proud that they said no to a
powerful multinational corporation which would tear up one more environmental
jewel in the search for fossil fuel.

The Whaleback is not just more mountains and hills, it is a national treasure.

Please, Amoco, forget your appeal to change the decision of the ERCB.

In the name of environmental responsibility, leave Whaleback alone!

J. SANGSTER, Calgary.

FALLOW FIELDS USED TO DISPOSE OF OIL-DRILLING WASTE

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: PULSE; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 1169 words


But we're ignoring the heavy metals left behind, warns environmentalist

Alhambra

Arelin Von Hollen looks at the 25 truckloads of oily waste dotting a field near
his home and the thought crosses his mind that someone should have notified him
about it.

There isn't much real estate between Arelin and Fay Von Hollen's well and the
site being used here for landfarming one of many such fields in Alberta where
drilling wastes are mixed with the soil so the oil biodegrades naturally.

The Von Hollens aren't opposed to landfarming, but they and other neighbors
would like a little more information about what's happening on the former
hayfield near this village east of Rocky Mountain House.

Unfortunately, not much is available, says Rocky Mountain House environmentalist
Martha Kostuch, who cites the Alhambra case as an example of what's wrong in
Alberta with landfarming.

Landfarming usually is done at the drilling site if the soil is suitable, but
dozens of private sites across Alberta also are used.

"The Energy Resources Conservation Board approved this site for landfarming
without any information on what's in the drilling waste," says Kostuch. "They've
done no testing of the drilling waste. It stinks. The regulations are totally
inadequate."

Kostuch is especially concerned about the quantities of heavy metals that
legally can be part of landfarmed materials enough to kill a herd of cows,
according to Kostuch, who's a veterinarian.

Drilling waste management guidelines released last June by the board permit
landfarming of up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of lead per hectare, 100
kilograms of vanadium and 1.5 kilograms of cadmium contained in drilling waste.

The metals are highly toxic and remain in the soil forever unless they migrate
somewhere else, she says, noting that "You only need a teaspoon of lead to kill
a cow. . . . There's nothing saying the field can't be farmed later for products
sold for human consumption, or used for animals for human consumption."

Nobody talked to adjacent landowners about potential groundwater and surface
water contamination, she says of the Alhambra site, which is fenced and bermed
but is slightly higher than adjacent properties.

Bev Goodwin, whose well is less than a kilometre down a slope from the site
holding 230 cubic metres of drilling tailings, observes that when a neighbor
wanted to make wedding cakes in Goodwin's home, everyone had to be notified
about the small business. When diesel fuel-based drilling waste goes in next
door, "nobody was notified."

Although the soil is tested to ensure it's suitable for landfarming, there's no
requirement to test groundwater for contamination before or after drilling
wastes are put on the site, she says. Furthermore, Kostuch adds, the ERCB
doesn't have the staff to properly monitor such sites.

Leonard Healy of Endrill Resources Consultants Inc., which specializes in
drilling waste disposal, argues that permitted metal loading levels are
conservative, and were developed after extensive research.

"I know Martha is concerned, but these things have been looked at by the ERCB
and Alberta Environment, and the regulations have been developed over seven
years."

Healy has examined drilling wastes from more than 100 wells, and never has seen
metal content even approaching permitted levels.

Healy says landfarming is the safest, most cost-effective and most
environmentally responsible way of dealing with oily drilling wastes and the
land owner is paid a fee that more than compensates for the lack of agricultural
production on the site.

Landfarming sites are chosen for their clay soil, which provides an impermeable
layer which prevents contaminants from migrating into groundwater, he says.

Mark Miller, a senior environment technician with the ERCB, says the
Alhambra-area case is the first approved under new drilling waste guidelines
released last June. The guidelines for heavy metals in landfarmed materials were
based on studies of 114 sump pits and on standards for sludge derived from
sewage, which has been spread on farmers' fields for years.

ERCB standards ensure safety for growing vegetation or cereal crops on private
land after a one-time application of drilling waste, Miller says, arguing that
contaminants are mixed into about three million kilograms of dirt comprising the
top 15 centimetres of a hectare.

But Kostuch counters that Miller is assuming the contaminants don't leach from
the soil, that they're evenly distributed, and that they don't accumulate in
certain plants.

Although there's no requirement that neighbors be notified about a landfarming
site or that a landowner be told what's in the drilling waste oil companies
supply such information to the ERCB.

Landfarming is great, says landowner Ray Ahlstrom, who has leased his
two-hectare hayfield to Pancanadian and insists he's so pleased with the way
it's gone, he'd do it again.

Landfarming is an environmentally friendly way to get rid of diesel fuel,
Ahlstrom argues. He points out he's in the oil construction business and is well
aware of what's in drilling waste.

Says Pancanadian Petroleum spokesman John O'Donnell: "The ERCB regulations state
you have to test the soil on which the tailings are to be landfarmed, and the
tailings themselves immediately prior to landfarming." That's done in part in
case somebody tries to dump additional material on to the tailings, he says.

O'Donnell says that routine tests of the drilling mud done during drilling
indicate low levels of heavy metal "way lower than the minimum set by the ERCB."

Tailings at the Alhambra-area site haven't been tested because freeze-up
occurred before they could be landfarmed. But, O'Donnell says, Pancanadian is
confident that fluids won't migrate off-site because of the soil's clay content.
Before landfarming is done, most diesel fuel is removed from tailings and taken
to an oil recycling plant for refuse, he says.

Test results done prior to landfarming in the spring will be submitted to the
ERCB before the board will give final approval to proceed, O'Donnell says.

What's in the material depends on where and how deep a company drills. "Right
now, I don't know (what's in it)," he says.

O'Donnell insists, "We don't want anyone to think we're doing anything dangerous
or wrong. We're very concerned about our image, and that's why we follow the
regulations to the letter."

Don Beamer, air and waste supervisor for the ERCB, notes that every site is
inspected at some stage, at least before it's reclaimed.

Beamer says some farmers in the Wainwright area, where there's sandy soil, line
up for the right to put the drilling fluids on their fields because the
substance seems to help sandy soils retain water. But Kostuch argues people
should know exactly what they're getting into with landfarming. "A lot of people
think, 'The government is looking after us. If they say it's OK, it must be OK.
. .' People have to take more responsibility."

After steering EUB through spying scandal, chair resigns

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITYPLUS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 626  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


EDMONTON - The man who took over the now defunct Alberta Energy and Utilities
Board after a spying scandal resigned Monday with mixed reviews from opposition
party leaders.

A spokesman for the Energy Resources Conservation Board said the resignation of
Bill Tilleman closes the book on the EUB's controversial hiring of private
detectives to spy on landowners opposed to a 500-kv transmission line.

Tilleman was appointed by Energy Minister Mel Knight six months ago to address
problems within the regulatory board. That same day, Knight released a report by
former Queen's Bench justice Del Perras that called the spying "repulsive."

An earlier report by the province's Freedom of Information and Privacy
commissioner ruled the board breached the Privacy Act when it passed on
information about the landowners.

In the weeks after Tilleman's appointment, the board's security unit was
disbanded and the executive in charge of the unit resigned, followed shortly by
three board members who presided over that hearing.

Tilleman declared a mistrial in the hearing into the powerline, and announced
the process of approving the Edmonton-Calgary transmission line would go back to
Square 1.

"Dr. Tilleman implemented all of the changes outlined in both Mr. Justice
Perras' report and the FOIP commissioner's report, in addition to granting a
mistrial on the 500-kv hearing," said board spokesman Tom Neufeld. "There will
be no more changes."

Tilleman didn't respond to an interview request, but in a written statement said
he was proud of the seamless transition of the EUB into the new Energy Resources
Conservation Board and the Alberta Utilities Commission.

"Both of those agencies are now on good footing with clear mandates and great
leadership," he said.

The new board will be headed by former Alberta Energy deputy minister Dan
McFadyen, who started the job Feb. 1.

Alberta Liberal Leader Kevin Taft said Tilleman "did some of the right things."

"From what I can see, Tilleman took some decisive actions," Taft said. "It was
in many ways too late, but it did send a signal that the spying on citizens was
unacceptable."

NDP Leader Brian Mason said Tilleman cleaned up "a political mess" for the
governing Conservatives, quietly removing people who were embarrassing the
Stelmach government.

But both leaders said they're concerned McFadyen, a deputy minister of a
department whose senior ranks were criticized by Auditor General Fred Dunn as
being unco-operative, is now in charge of the oil and gas regulator.

"I am not sure we will have a culture of openness and transparency in the
successor bodies of the EUB," said Mason. "I don't see anything that will keep
it from happening in the future."

Taft said the appointment of McFadyen won't boost public trust of a board some
described as the most despised public body in the province.

"If he was difficult and unco-operative with the auditor general, I am concerned
he will be difficult and unco-operative with the ERCB," he said.

"The ERCB needs to be independent and it needs to be seen as independent, and I
don't think it meets either of those criteria."

Joe Anglin, one of the leaders of a landowners' group that opposed the
powerline, called efforts to clean house at the regulator "a complete failure,"
but said he's not sure how much authority Tilleman had.

"He could never have succeeded," said Anglin, who blew the whistle on the
spying. "They put him there with the understanding ... he would be cleaning up
the EUB, but they wouldn't investigate what was wrong or the problems that
caused it."

Anglin said the situation cried out for an independent public inquiry.

Without one, the public will be wary of the new boards, and confidence in board
decisions will be low, Anglin predicted.

NO GUARANTEE IN PIPELINE SCHEDULE

BYLINE: HERALD STAFF

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D9

LENGTH: 121 words


Completion of the latest Alberta-to-California pipeline project on schedule for
a Nov. 1 start on new deliveries can no longer be guaranteed, the Calgary
sponsor of the last leg in the natural gas export package said Monday.

Nova Corp. said it cannot assure completion of additions to its Alberta
gas-gathering system on time, after the province's Energy Resources Conservation
Board missed a target date of March 1 for approving the new facilities.

A Nova spokesman stressed construction is not an exact science and it may still
be possible to meet the Nov. 1 target set by San Francisco-based Pacific Gas
Transmission Co. But the regulatory delay means the schedule can no longer be
guaranteed, he said.

NOVA FORESEES BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR POLYSAR UNIT

BYLINE: MARITA VAN OLDENBORGH; Journal of Commerce Special

SECTION: CHEMICALS/PLASTICS, Pg. 9B

LENGTH: 677 words

DATELINE: SEATTLE


This week, Polysar Energy & Chemical Corp.'s board of directors is scheduled to
approve the definitive agreement between itself and Nova Corp. of Alberta giving
the latter a 100 percent interest in Polysar Ltd., the petrochemical arm of
Polysar.

Although the deal still needs Polysar shareholder approval before it can be
finalized, rumors are already circulating throughout the petrochemical industry
bout what Nova might do with its new acquisition.

In fact, Nova has no plans to change any part of Polysar's operations for the
foreseeable future, says Nova president Jim Butler. Company headquarters will
stay in Sarnia and there are no plans to dispose of any of the component parts
at this time, he said.

That position effectively gives Polysar the go-ahead to proceed with two major
expansion projects it was already planning before the sale to Nova was first
announced in June.

Nova last week reaffirmed its support of Polysar's plans to expand both its
styrene and polystyrene capacity within the next two years, Mr. Butler said.
Work is already under way on a C$ 30 million (about $ 25 million) project to
restart a mothballed 90,000 metric-tons-a-year styrene plant in Sarnia by April
1989. And polystyrene capacity at the company's Decatur, Ala., plant is to be
doubled to around 108,000 metric tons a year by early 1990.

Those two projects will make Nova, a newcomer to the styrenics business, a
leading North American producer of both styrene and polystyrene with total
capacities of 370,000 metric tons a year and over 400,000 metric tons a year
respectively, most of which is sold in the United States.

Polysar currently claims to be among the top three suppliers of polystyrene
resin in North America with 15 percent market share in 1987.

A third proposal, to debottleneck Polysar's 1 billion lb./year ethylene cracker
at Sarnia by some 150 million- 200 million lbs./year, is still under discussion,
Mr. Butler said.

The extra 1 billion plus lb./year ethylene capacity that would come to Nova
through the Polysar acquisition will certainly help to feed its own growing
polyethylene capacity, but it does not affect its longstanding plans t o build a
third 1.5 billion lb./year ethylene plant at Joffre, Alberta, according to Mr.
Butler.

The Sarnia cracker will continue to supply Du Pont Canada's ethylene
requirements under an existing arrangement, he added.

Instead, the decision on whether to go ahead with a completely new cracker will
turn on Nova's ability to obtain the desired ethane supply guarantees from the
provincial government. The company is still working on trying to persuade the
Alberta government not to adopt the recent recommendations of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board in its report on Alberta's ethane policy.

Nova can build a plant under the recommendations of the ERCB, Mr. Butler
reiterated.

Another part of Polysar's petrochemical activities - its rubber operation - is
of less obvious interest to Nova. Polysar has for some time now been pruning its
branches in that sector - pulling out of synthetic butadiene rubber production
in Europe and, more recently, selling its latex division to BASF of West Germany
- and rumors have been circulating that Nova might wish to speed up that
process.

However, Nova's Mr. Butler says his company has no such intention, claiming that
the deal would be going ahead if any part of Polysar's operations had been
excluded from it.

The European activities of Polysar, although they do mostly revolve around
rubber and rubber products, will give Nova a foothold on the other side of the
Atlantic for the first time.

Polysar last year earned revenues of C$ 616 million from its operations in
Europe and the rest of the world out of the 1987 total of C$ 2.87 billion. For
its part, Nova - which has been trying for some time to market its polyethylenes
in Europe - has no plans to expand its operations there, or at least it is too
soon to tell, according to Mr. Butler who is planning to visit Polysar's sites
in Europe in September.

CORRECTION:

In a story published July 11 on Nova Corp.'s plans following its acquisition of
Polysar Ltd., Nova President Jim Butler should have been quoted as saying that
no one can build a plant under the recommendations of the ERCB, a comment on the
Energy Resources Conservation Board's recommendations for government control of
industry use of ethane feedstock. The story also should have reported Mr. Butler
as saying that the acquisition would not be going ahead if any part of Polysar's
current operations had been excluded from the deal, commenting on speculation
that Polysar might seek to continue the sale of parts of its rubber business.

PENNY-PINCHING CHAMPS: From the front lines come cost-saving suggestions

BYLINE: CAROL HOWES

SECTION: BUSINESS; ON THE JOB; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 783 words


For as long as she can remember, Rita Burke has had money-saving ideas bouncing
around in her head.

Burke, who works in the gas department of the Energy Resources Conservation
Board, knew that if she could just get the right people to listen, she could
save the provincial agency a small fortune.

Then last July, the ERCB took her up on her offer and within a few short months
Burke had saved the board $ 41,000.

Like a growing number of organizations in Canada and the U.S., the ERCB has an
employee suggestion program that allows all workers to present their ideas to
those higher up in the organization, have them evaluated, have the good ones
implemented and in return earn rewards for their initiative.

Three weeks after the program began last summer, Burke had offered three ideas
on how to save money in her department. One was as simple as changing the way
staff stuffed envelopes. It netted a savings of $ 5,000.

Called MAGIC - Make All Good Ideas Count -the ERCB's program has won the
provincial regulator an award from the Virginia-based Employee Involvement
Association for beating out 26 other North American organizations in its
industry group in saving the most money per employee in 1993.

In six months, ideas from staff either to make money or cut costs saved the ERCB
$ 112,000.

Bill Schnitzler, who oversees the MAGIC program, says this year is looking even
better. The board has approved ideas to date with a potential savings of at
least $ 400,000.

The Employee Involvement Association, which has been around in one form or
another since 1942, claims employee suggestions saves its member organizations
more than $ 2 billion US a year.

Bob Nelson, with the San Diego-based human resources firm Blanchard Training and
Development Inc. and author of 1001 Ways to Reward Employees (Workman
Publishing), cites a study that shows only 41 per cent of employees believe the
average company listens to employee's ideas. The average American worker (and
likely Canadian) only makes one or two suggestions a year compared to hundreds
of suggestions submitted by Japanese workers.

Yet the benefits of employee ideas can be tremendous. One Amoco plant alone in
Texas City uses a suggestion plan that has saved the oil company $ 18.8 million
US in two years.

In its first six months, the ERCB's MAGIC program drew 185 suggestions. Of 46
which were evaluated in 1993, 31 were implemented.

In most organizations there is a general resistance from managers towards
following up on employee's ideas, says Brian Bietz, an ERCB board member who
pushed for MAGIC.

"It's not an active resistance to new ideas, it's always passive. 'Your idea is
one more thing for me to deal with in a busy schedule."'

He says the idea for the ERCB suggestion program came out of a total quality
management initiative the board started three years ago. Employee surveys
revealed good ideas were getting lost in the system.

So the board put a team together to come up with a solution. It created a data
system so employees could submit their ideas to the appropriate managers and
departments.

Bietz says that while some organizations offer substantial cash rewards for
employees' suggestions that are implemented, the ERCB was surprised to discover
that its more than 600 employees didn't want to go that route. They preferred
other forms of recognition instead, so the board set up a "recognition" point
system in which points can be redeemed for gift certificates, time off, training
opportunities, merchandise, or donations to charities.

Employee Mike Drake recently donated his winnings of $ 1,000 to World Vision.
His department came up with an idea that has saved the ERCB a number of days of
work by eliminating progress reports from companies on flooding oil wells with
water, a method of boosting production.

"I think (MAGIC) is a good idea. It's a place to voice some of your ideas, to
make you think of how you can improve your working conditions or the operation
as a whole," says Drake. "In the past, people might have been a little
frightened to voice ideas."

The ERCB suggestion program is open to managers, even though some of them have
mixed feelings about it.

Rob Cox, an assistant manager of drilling in the ERCB's drilling production
department, says generating cost-saving ideas are just part of his job. But his
suggestion to delegate the signing authority of well licences translated into a
savings of about $ 25,000 and the board awarded him through the program.

So Cox decided to take his "recognition" points and set up an account to
distribute them amongst the employees in his department to reward them for their
hard work instead.

The Alberta government and oil industry say disposing oil drilling wastes by
spreading them on farmland is safe. But others worried about environmental risks
warn they could be...Spreading the seeds of soil contamination

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT; CALGARY HERALD

SECTION: OUR PLANET; Pg. C4

DATELINE: ALHAMBRA, Alta.


Arelin Von Hollen looks at the 25 truckloads of oily waste on a field near his
home and the thought crosses his mind that somebody should have notified him
about it.

There isn't much real estate between Arelin and Fay Von Hollen's well and the
site being used here for landfarming, one of many such fields in Alberta where
drilling wastes are spread on soil so they biodegrade naturally.

The Von Hollens aren't opposed to landfarming but they and other neighbors
insist they'd like a little more information about what's happening on the
former hayfield near this central Alberta village east of Rocky Mountain House.

Unfortunately, not much is available, says Rocky Mountain House environmentalist
Martha Kostuch, who cites the Alhambra case as an example of what's wrong in
Alberta with landfarming.

Landfarming is usually done at the drilling site if the soil is suitable, but
there are also dozens of sites across Alberta where private land is used.

"The Energy Resources Conservation Board approved this site for landfarming
without any information on what's in the drilling waste" says Kostuch. "They've
done no testing of the drilling waste. It stinks. The regulations are totally
inadequate."

She's especially concerned about the amounts of heavy metals that can legally be
part of landfarmed materials, enough to kill a herd of cows, according to
Kostuch, who's a veterinarian.

Drilling waste management guidelines released last June by the board permit
landfarming of up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of lead per hectare, 100
kilograms of vanadium and 1.5 kilograms of cadmium contained in drilling waste.

The metals are highly toxic and remain in the soil "forever" unless they migrate
somewhere else, she says. "You only need a teaspoon of lead to kill a cow ...
There's nothing saying the field can't be farmed later for products sold for
human consumption, or used for animals for human consumption."

Nobody talked to adjacent landowners about potential groundwater and surface
water contamination, she says of the site, which is fenced and bermed, but is
slightly higher than adjacent properties.

Bev Goodwin's well is less than one kilometre down a slope from the site holding
230 cubic metres of drilling tailings. She observes that when a neighbor wanted
to make wedding cakes in Goodwin's home, all the neighbors had to be notified
about the small business.

When it's diesel fuel-based drilling waste going in next door, "nobody was
notified."

Although the soil is tested to ensure it's suitable for landfarming, there's no
requirement to test groundwater for contamination before or after drilling
wastes are put on the site, she says. Furthermore, Kostuch says, the Energy
Resources Conservation Board doesn't have the staff to properly monitor such
sites.

Leonard Healy, of Endrill Resources Consultants Inc., which specializes in
drilling waste disposal, argues that permitted metal loading levels are
conservative and were developed after extensive research.

"These things have been looked at by the ERCB and Alberta Environment, and the
regulations have been developed over seven years."

He said he's examined drilling wastes from more than 100 wells and has never
seen metal content even approaching permitted levels.

Healy said landfarming is the safest, most cost-effective and most
environmentally responsible way of dealing with oily drilling wastes. The land
owner, he adds, is paid a fee that more than compensates for lack of
agricultural production on the site.

Landfarming sites are chosen for their clay soil, which provides an impermeable
layer preventing migration of contaminants and contamination of aquifers, he
said.

Mark Miller, a senior environment technical with the ERCB, says the
Alhambra-area case is the first approved under new drilling waste guidelines
released last June. The guidelines for heavy metals in landfarmed materials were
based on studies of 114 sump pits and on standards for sludge derived from
sewage, which has been spread on farmers' fields for years.

ERCB standards ensure safety for growing vegetation or cereal crops on private
land after a one-time application of drilling waste, Miller says. He says the
contaminants are mixed into about three million kilograms of dirt comprising the
top 15 centimetres of a hectare.

But Kostuch counters that he's assuming there's no leaching of contaminants,
that contaminants are evenly distributed throughout soil, and that there's no
accumulation of heavy metals in certain plants.

Although there's no requirement that neighbors be notified about a landfarming
site or that a landowner be told about what's in the drilling waste oil,
companies supply such information to the ERCB.

No everyone is skeptical about landfarming. Ray Ahlstrom, who has leased his
two-hectare hayfield to Pancanadian, insists he's so pleased with the way it's
gone, he'd do it again.

Don Beamer, air and waste supervisor for the ERCB, notes every site is inspected
at some stage, at least before it's reclaimed.

Beamer says some farmers in the Wainwright area, southeast of Edmonton, where
there's sandy soil, line up for the right to put the drilling fluids on their
fields because the substance seems to help sandy soils retain water.

But Kostuch argues people should know exactly what they're getting into with
landfarming. "A lot of people think, The government is looking after us. If they
say it's OK, it must be OK... ' People have to take more responsibility."

Texas election clout spells danger for our oil industry Presidential candidates
will face strong pressure for industry aid

BYLINE: (CP)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 431 words

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta


   CALGARY (CP) - Canadian oil and gas producers will face tougher competition
for sales in the United States if a powerful Texas oilfield watchdog agency has
its way.

With a slap at "damn thievin' Yankees," Texas Railroad Commission chairman James
Nugent said in Calgary that his state will take advantage of this year's
presidential election to lobby for federal help for its ailing energy industry.

No one has become president in modern times without winning Texas, he said. His
agency's members are elected, with a more political role than officers of its
Alberta counterpart, the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB).

Texas is the third most populous state and its leaders are prodding the
presidential candidates into taking stands on help for its oil and gas industry,
he said.

Nugent, a Democrat, outlined Texas demands for an American "national energy
policy" at a Calgary Chamber of Commerce luncheon, after private meetings with
the ERCB and the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission.

Although he rejected outright protectionist action such as a U.S. oil import
tax, he stressed that Texas energy companies need help to become tougher
competitors.

He called for corporate tax reductions and removal of lingering U.S. price
controls on natural gas discovered before 1978.

While he called Texas and Alberta friends, he also declared himself neutral in
the debate over the free-trade agreement between Ottawa and Washington.

The Texan sugar-coated his message to Calgary exporters, who are counting on
their low-cost supplies to give them advantages in the U.S., by suggesting his
state and Alberta have much in common politically.

"Unfortunately, we have some trouble with our northeastern political
establishment. In that, there's some brotherhood with you."

He said U.S. gas-price controls are lingering because most of the supplies still
affected flow to the northeast from the southwestern producing states.

He accused Washington of subsidizing Middle East oil producers such as Kuwait by
as much as $120 (U.S.) a barrel for their output, with military assistance and
foreign-aid programs.

Texans want performance from the next president after years of failing to win
anywhere near as much aid as their foreign competitors, said Nugent.

He painted a gloomy portrait of a state which has failed to rebound from the
fall of oil and gas prices.

The level of oil field activity in Texas is still only 12 per cent of healthier
times, with just 175 drilling rigs currently at work compared to 1,450 six years
ago, Nugent said.

Vocational training in the construction sector in Central Asia

LENGTH: 507  words


Title: Vocational training in the construction sector as a contribution to
climate change mitigation and resource conservation in Central Asia
Commissioned by: German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ)


Country: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
Lead executing agency: Ministries of education, labour, employment and social
security
Overall term: 2010 to 2014
Context
Despite repeated attempts at reform, the newly independent states of Central
Asia have not yet managed to strengthen their economies for the generation of
growth and employment. Among the reasons for this are structural shortcomings in
the vocational training system. Curricula that are outdated and insufficiently
practice-oriented, materials and equipment in the schools are obsolete, there
are too few opportunities for teaching staff to receive further training, and
there are deficiencies in the management of the training institutions.
These shortcomings can bee seen in all sectors, but they are particularly
significant in the construction industry because, after agriculture, this is the
sector that provides the most jobs. It is also well placed to improve the energy
-efficiency of buildings and thus hep to avoid bottlenecks in the energy supply.
Despite the fact that the Central Asian climate is subject to extreme
temperature fluctuations through the year, the idea of energy-efficient
construction as a means of saving energy has yet to take hold. There is also a
severe lack of skills needed to apply it in practice.
Objective
Vocational training institutions and companies are able to provide training in
ecologically sustainable construction to staff working in specific areas of the
building industry. The partner countries recognise the importance of the
construction sector for climate protection and resource conservation and they
are developing practical approaches to energy-efficient construction.
Approach
The programme provides the managerial staff of ministries, institutions,
associations and companies information about the basic principles and
possibilities of environmentally sustainable construction; they also learn how
they can use this know-how to contribute to climate protection and the
conservation of resources. They steer and support the work of the people taking
part in training courses and seminars as part of the project.
The directors of vocational training institutions in the construction sector as
well as in-company training managers acquire additional expertise and skills
relevant to the administrative management and professional leadership of their
institutions. They learn about possible forms of cooperation between schools and
local companies (social partnership) and put these into practice.

The developers of teaching and learning materials are kept up to date with the
latest sector-specific developments in terms of practical applications and
educational approaches. They learn how to produce better teaching and learning

ALBERTA ISSUES GAS LINE STUDY: Board avoids judgment call

BYLINE: Calgary

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 400 words

DATELINE: Alta.


   The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has released its long-awaited
report on the rival Altamont Gas Transmission Co. and Pacific Gas Transmission
Co. proposals for new pipelines to ship Canadian gas to California.

But the board has studiously avoided making any firm judgments on the two
projects' relative merits, and has instead urged Alberta gas producers to make
their own decision.

''This . . . report is intended to consolidate and present relevant information
to allow producers to make comparisons. The report notes that it was not
possible from the material filed to resolve all the uncertainties surrounding
the two ventures,'' the board said.

The board found that there is even some question about whether any immediate
capacity additions to gas pipeline between Canada and California would be in
Alberta gas producers' best interests.

''Beyond the year 2000, both (project proponents) agree the market will support
additional capacity. As for the interval between now and 2000, some question
lingers as to whether any additional pipeline capacity is needed,'' the board
said.

In the short term, building new gas pipelines for mass exports of Canadian gas
to California could drive down gas prices further or could delay gas price
recovery, the board warned. Even if California is a good market for Canadian gas
over the next several years, it might be better to increase the use of gas
storage to meet peak demands rather than building new pipelines, the board
added.

It found that the PGT project had a lower risk of cost-overruns than the
Altamont project, would probably have lower shipping tolls and has ''somewhat
stronger'' transportation commitments in place from gas shippers. But it also
found that the PGT project is ''more shrouded in regulatory uncertainty'' than
the Altamont project, mainly because it is more under the jurisdiction of the
California Public Utilities Commission, and that this could pose a risk to
Canadian gas producers.

In an interview yesterday, Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman gave assurances
the Alberta government will not step in to decide which pipeline project should
proceed.

''I'm pleased with the comprehensiveness of the document. There is a tremendous
amount of material here to assist producers in making their decision,'' he said.
''We're going to leave it in the producers' hands.''

Amoco drilling can improve elk habitat, hearing told

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 513 words


A provincial plan, specifying wildlife habitat must be saved in the
environmentally sensitive Whaleback area applies only to elk, Amoco Canada's
environmental services supervisor argued Wednesday.

John Ward told an Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) hearing - examining
an Amoco proposal to drill an exploratory well in the Whaleback - that the
Integrated Resource Plan for the region identifies elk as the particular species
of concern.

The plan, approved by the provincial cabinet, states mineral development can
only take place in the Whaleback critical wildlife zone if there's no net loss
of wildlife habitat.

Ron Findlay, Amoco's general manger of environment, health and safety, insisted
the company can actually improve the area for elk.

But Findlay admitted, in response to questions by ERCB senior adviser Roger
Creasey, that the company's activities might impinge on the habitat of other
species such as songbirds.

Environmentalists and local ranchers, who feel the Whaleback shouldn't be
developed because the series of ridges and valleys is the largest remaining area
of "montane" ecosystem in the country, are fighting Amoco's proposal.

Creasey also asked whether there might have to be a reduction in hunting if oil
and gas developments and other activities continue to nibble away at wildlife
habitat.

John Kansas, a wildlife ecologist appearing on behalf of Amoco, responded: "Yes,
for sure. You just can't have it all."

Another Amoco witness, wildlife biologist Luigi Morgantini, agreed under
questioning by Creasey that recommendations by the provincial wildlife biologist
for the area, Lorne Fitch, would apply to the entire Amoco development - up to
20 wells, if the exploratory well is successful - but not to the initial well.

Fitch said in a Jan. 6 letter to the board that an environmental assessment of
the Amoco development "will need to address potential impact on the entire range
of species associated with the montane ecosystem . . . Of key importance to the
environmental assessment, is an inventory of wildlife species present."

Ironically, Fitch's name continues to come up at the hearings, even though he's
not present - the provincial government has refused to make him available.

The ERCB also refused to subpoena Fitch (who was also consulted by Amoco),
saying the information he would supply is available from other sources.

The board's decision prompted Mike Sawyer, of the relatively radical Rocky
Mountain Ecosystem Coalition, to stand up at the hearing and accuse the board of
a "cowardly and despicable act."

Dianne Pachal, of the Alberta Wilderness Association, criticized the provincial
government for not allowing Fitch to participate. She pointed out that he has
been the provincial biologist for the area for 18 years and was on the planning
team for the Integrated Resources Plan.

"The province wants this development to go ahead (because it will mean
substantial resources revenue.) They don't want the public to know why this area
should remain intact," she said in an interview.

OIL PRODUCTION WILL SURGE

BYLINE: DONALD CAMPBELL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 378 words


Economy triggers aggressive drilling in Alberta, says ERCB

Alberta's conventional oil production could grow beyond one million barrels per
day by 1995 if drilling activity stays at aggressive levels experienced in 1993,
the Energy Resources Conservation Board says.

The ERCB released Monday new production forecasts that take into account the
positive economic environment within the industry in the past 12 months. The
forecasts suggest production could peak next year at levels ranging from 960,000
to 1.02 million barrels a day.

Total conventional oil production reached 935,000 barrels per day in 1993. The
ERCB forecast suggests production could still climb by a range of 2.6 per cent
to 9.6 per cent above last year's levels.

The last time daily production of conventional oil gushed over the
one-million-barrel mark was 1984, according to ERCB figures.

Kevin Johnston, a senior economist at the ERCB, explained several favorable
economic factors created the need to update its forecast, which renews a
previous study done in 1989:

* The unanticipated surge in drilling in 1993 created higher than expected
productivity from new wells.

* New technology such as three-dimensional seismic exploration and horizontal
drilling has assisted in finding and reaching new supplies.

* A drop in interest rates has made capital cheaper and more accessible for a
larger number of companies to pursue new drilling opportunities.

Production capacity from the oilsands will likely not expand in the 1990s to
levels anticipated in 1989. Synthetic crude production could reach 360,000
barrels per day by the year 2000 if an expansion of Syncrude proceeds, the ERCB
said, but will peak at 285,000 barrels if it doesn't.

Synthetic crude production in 1993 was 245,000 barrels per day, according to the
ERCB. A breakthrough creating greater efficiency in synthetic crude production
could also drive up production levels, Johnston said.

"There have been so many efficiency improvements over the last few years that
production costs could be quite different in 10 years," he said.

"Our forecasts are based on what we know about production costs today. There may
well be further efficiency improvements that change that perhaps dramatically."

California: AB-1918 Energy: design and construction standards.

LENGTH: 1807  words

DATELINE: Sacramento


Office of the Senate, The State of California has issued the following news
release:


AB 1918, as amended, Williams. Energy: design and construction standards.
Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission to prescribe, by regulation, building design and construction
standards and energy and water conservation design standards for new residential
and nonresidential buildings.
This bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission to identify and implement methods to simplify processes and
procedures related to compliance with the above described standards.


Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority
over public utilities, including electrical corporations and gas corporations,
as defined. The Public Utilities Act requires the Public Utilities Commission to
review and accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical
corporation. The act requires that an electrical corporation's proposed
procurement plan include certain elements, including a showing that the
electrical corporation will first meet its unmet needs through all available
energy efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost effective,
reliable, and feasible. Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission,
in consultation with the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission, to identify all potentially achievable cost-effective electricity
efficiency savings and to establish efficiency targets for electrical
corporations to achieve pursuant to their procurement plan. The Public Utilities
Act additionally requires the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with
the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to identify
all potentially achievable cost-effective natural gas efficiency savings and to
establish efficiency targets for gas corporations to achieve and requires that a
gas corporation first meet its unmet resource needs through all available gas
efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost effective, reliable, and
feasible. Pursuant to its existing authority, the Public Utilities Commission
has approved energy efficiency programs for electrical corporations and gas
corporations, with 3rd parties administering a portion of those programs.
This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission, in an existing
proceeding, to establish, by January 1, 2016, an incentive program for
contractors and local governments to improve the verification of building code
compliance and acceptance of central heating and air cooling equipment following
installation. to authorize a program to improve compliance with the State
Building Standards Code requirements, and any applicable local ordinances, for
heating and air conditioning equipment through existing energy efficiency
programs administered by electrical corporations and gas corporations, or
administered by 3rd parties on behalf of electrical corporations and gas
corporations.
Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order,
decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the Public Utilities
Commission is a crime.
Because certain of the provisions of this bill are within the act and require
action by the Public Utilities Commission to implement, a violation of the
program provisions adopted by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to the
bill's requirements would impose a state-mandated local program by expanding the
current definition of a crime.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and
school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions
establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a
specified reason.
Digest Key
Vote: MAJORITY   Appropriation: NO   Fiscal Committee: YES   Local Program:
NOYES
Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) California's building energy efficiency standards are recognized as leading
the nation in energy savings. They are an important component of the state's
programs to manage its energy consumption, conserve natural resources, and
improve the quality of life for all its citizens.
(b) Heating and cooling buildings is one of the largest electricity end uses in
the state and is also the single largest contributor to peak electricity demand,
comprising up to 30 percent of total demand in the hot summer months.
(c) In the 2008 Strategic Plan to Reduce the Energy Impact of Air Conditioners,
the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission identified
that a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) can increase
energy use by 20 or 30 percent if it is poorly installed regardless of its
efficiency rating.
(d) Permits are required for the replacement of heating and cooling equipment
and a code official must verify installation in compliance with the building
energy efficiency standards. The effectiveness of the building energy efficiency
standards is dependent upon the conscientious efforts of licensed contractors
contractors, local building officials, property owners, builders, and others in
California to follow these permitting requirements to build buildings and
install components and equipment in compliance with the standards which deliver
cost-effective energy savings to consumers.

(e)California building codes are updated regularly, necessitating more training
and education for building officials performing permitting, plan checking, and
inspections. Providing this education in tandem with incentives for beyond-code
performance will motivate both local building departments and contractors to
prioritize energy efficiency performance in their day-to-day operations.
(e) Local governments issue required permits for heating and cooling equipment
and are in an unique role to help address low energy code compliance. As the
agencies responsible for enforcement, local governments are in a distinct
position to understand and identify some of the critical factors limiting full
compliance with the building energy efficiency standards. By continuing to
strategically identify and target these factors, energy efficiency programs can
capitalize on this local government role to further support increased compliance
and capture cost-effective energy savings to consumers.
(f) In an effort to increase permitted activity, some local jurisdictions have
adopted practices that make it easier to obtain permits or have implemented
pilot programs to educate and train local building staff. It is in California's
best interest to facilitate the adoption of demonstrated best practices for
local building departments across the state to undertake to maximize compliance
with building codes.
SEC. 2.
 Section 25402.12 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:

25402.12.
 The commission, in consultation with the Contractors' State License Board,
local building officials, and other stakeholders, shall identify and implement
methods to simplify processes and procedures related to compliance with
standards established pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 25402.

SEC. 3.
 Section 381.3 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:

381.3.
 (a) By January 1, 2016, the commission, in an existing proceeding, shall
establish an incentive program for contractors and local governments to improve
the verification of building code compliance and acceptance of central heating
and air cooling equipment following installation. The incentives may include,
but are not limited to, all of the following: authorize a program to improve
compliance with the State Building Standards Code requirements, and any
applicable local ordinances, for heating and air conditioning equipment through
existing energy efficiency programs administered by electrical corporations and
gas corporations, or administered by third parties on behalf of electrical
corporations and gas corporations. The program design may include, but is not
limited to, both of the following:
(1) Assisting local governments employing innovative approaches to reduce
barriers to, and increase compliance with, the permitting process for heating
and cooling equipment. Program elements may include:
(A) Public outreach campaigns.
(B) Computer-based permitting tools.
(C) Improvements to streamline the permitting process.
(D) Measures to address the market constraints resulting in low permit
compliance.
(E) Establishing programs, such as partnerships with local governments, to
specifically target improving compliance for installation of heating and air
conditioning equipment.
(F) Other measures to achieve greater compliance with State Building Standards
Code requirements, and any applicable local ordinances, for heating and air
conditioning equipment. Measures may include performance protocols necessary to
verify performance compliance of central heating and cooling equipment.
(2) Technical or financial support, including those methods identified by local
governments to assist local governments with ensuring compliance with State
Building Standards Code requirements, and any applicable local ordinances, for
heating and air conditioning equipment.
(b) The commission shall evaluate the program's design and quantify increased
permit compliance and energy savings as a result of permit compliance.

(a)Additional funding, as necessary, for training and certification programs for
central heating and air cooling equipment installers, local government building
officials, contractors, builders, and school building inspectors licensed
through the Division of the State Architect.

(b)Technical and financial support to establish performance protocols necessary
to verify performance compliance of central heating and air cooling equipment.

(c)Financial or other support to assist local agencies in offsetting costs
associated with employing innovative approaches to reduce barriers in the
permitting process for heating and cooling equipment, for example, expediting
the permitting process and measures to achieve greater compliance with state and
local building permit requirements.

SEC. 4.
 No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII
B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by
a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a
new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the
penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the
Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of
Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

Premier is lousy at lying

BYLINE: DON MARTIN, HERALD COLUMNIST, EDMONTON BUREAU

SECTION: NEWS; ALBERTA POLITICS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 548 words


EDMONTON

The designated MLA for the second-row Tory seat in the legislature didn't show
up for house duty Monday.

Ken Kowalski was busy packing boxes and shredding documents, no doubt personally
disgusted by the itsy-bitsy Federal and Intergovernmental Affairs ministry
moving into his former empire of suites strategically and (some used to say
symbolically) located directly above the premier's legislature office.

But even in a political death caused by being too controversial, the walking
controversy that is Kowalski refuses to die.

He dominated, in absentia, the Opposition agenda Monday and will remain their
hot topic for the rest of the week.

That's fair enough, because Premier Ralph Klein has broken a key election
promise by taking the plunge into big-time patronage.

Until now, his favoritism has been small stuff like, say, Friday's appointment
of Al Bell, an influential city hall lobbyist from Klein's mayoralty days, to a
powerful management board guiding research and development decisions. But
nothing has emerged from Klein's goodie bag in the same league as the
parachuting of sock 'em, mock 'em Kowalski to the $ 100,000-plus Alberta Energy
and Utilities Board post, arguably the province's top government job.

It wasn't a promising start for the Liberal's attack on the appointment. The
speaker ruled, correctly, the Grits couldn't question in the house what they had
asked the ethics commissioner to investigate.

For an embarrassing moment or two, it looked as though the Grits would be
responsible for having their own questions on Kowalski's alleged conflict ruled
out of order. But they persisted, and successfully forced Klein to do something
he's not very good at -- deflecting and distorting the truth.

Consider Klein's quote in defending Kowalski from conflict of interest
guidelines. Former cabinet ministers "should not accept" portfolio-linked jobs
for at least six months, Klein said. The appropriate reference is a much
stronger thou "shall not" jump into the pork barrel.

And he insisted there's no conflict because Kowalski's Economic Development
portfolio didn't have "significant dealings" with his inherited Energy Resources
Conservation Board. But just last month the ERCB ruled against oil drilling in
the Whaleback region because it may qualify for protection under Special Places
2000, a report from none other than Ken Kowalski.

It suggests Klein is only interested in defining the letter, not honoring the
spirit, of the legislation.

And then, for the proboscis-stretcher of the debate, there was Klein's bottom
line. "I don't see this (appointment) as cronyism," he insisted.

How else could one describe a job given, for the first time, to a politician who
did not apply for it, a full six months after the job search officially closed?

Pretending Kowalski's velvet landing in an almost-premier-matching paycheque is
anything but a big-league patronage handout only insults voters who elected a
Klein government seemingly hell-bent on keeping its promises at any cost.

Ken Kowalski got the job because the only alternative to his forced resignation
was to serve as MLA for Barrhead-Westlock.

And merely filling that Tory seat in the second row was an offer his
considerable ego had to refuse.

Discrediting the EUB doesn't serve Albertans

BYLINE: G. W. Govier., G. J. DeSorcy, M. N. McCrank, Calgary Herald

SECTION: Q: QUERIES - QUIBBLES - QUIRKS; In Rebuttal; Pg. A29

LENGTH: 718  words


Re: "Taming the regulatory beast," Editorial, Sept. 12.

In response to your editorial, we three former chairmen of the Alberta Energy
and Utilities Board (EUB), and its predecessor, the Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ERCB), would like to make sure that the key relevant facts
are brought to light.

We do not defend the decision of the EUB to hire a private investigating agency
to carry out covert activities resulting in the invasion of people's privacy.
That decision was clearly wrong, as has already been determined by the privacy
commissioner and a Queen's Bench justice.

However, it is clear from the investigations that there were security concerns
that the EUB had to address in the interests of "public safety."

The privacy commissioner's report states in paragraph 47:

"In my view, the EUB's concerns about safety and security at the Rimbey
proceedings are understandable . . . . Where there is sufficient anger to make
physical contact, it creates an unpredictable situation where it is reasonable
for the EUB to review its security arrangements."

The Queen's Bench justice states, in reference to the hearing on April 16, 2007:

"At some point, a scuffle, captured by a TV camera, occurred with a gentleman
shoving a staff member of the EUB. Constant interruption punctuated the efforts
of the panel to conduct the hearing. After adjourning until the next day,
matters continued in the same vein. Legal counsel speaking to the panel
characterized the proceedings as 'dysfunctional' and ' exceptional not for the
right reasons.'

"Others characterized the hearings as having descended into 'chaos' with a lack
of respect for the process. Swearing and pejorative epithets were cast at panel
members and ultimately the panel adjourned on April 18, 2007."

Some of the issues raised at the hearings brought emotional responses and
conduct of the proceedings was not easy. When unruliness led to physical action
and risk to public safety, the EUB had to act. We firmly believe that the action
taken (to hire an investigating agency) was taken solely in the interest of
protecting personal and public safety with no intent of invading personal
privacy.

All Albertans have the right to expect public hearings, like court proceedings,
to be held with order and dignity in facilities and under circumstances that are
safe. They also have the right of protection of their privacy and the EUB made a
serious error in judgment, not in acting, but in the way it acted.

Even so, we believe the decision to try to ensure public safety was made
honestly and in the public interest.

The privacy commissioner and the justice have made recommendations to ensure
that such an action will not reoccur. We understand that all the recommendations
have been accepted and are being acted upon by the EUB.

Earlier on, the government announced that it would be separating the
responsibilities of the EUB relating to the development, production, processing,
and transportation of energy resources from those dealing with public utilities.
We support this and we believe it will lead to more efficient operations in both
areas.

The question remaining is should the EUB be punished, be overhauled or
dismantled? Is it a "beast" that needs to be "tamed"?

We believe that Albertans have been served well for some 70 years with
dedication, competence and complete honesty by the EUB and its predecessor
organizations. These bodies have been responsible for the orderly and most
successful development of our energy resources. They have been held up as a
model throughout many parts of the world.

We are not saying that the EUB is perfect but rather that it is a fine
organization, doing an honest job of ensuring that Alberta's energy resources
are developed in an orderly and efficient manner in the public interest. It has
made a mistake which will not happen again. The EUB deserves our understanding,
our confidence and our respect.

We urge all who have a stake in this issue to reflect carefully. The
discrediting of a venerable institution is not, in our opinion, in the interest
of any of us.

Search begins for state's tidiest town

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 511  words


NOMINATIONS are being called for the 2006 Tidy Towns 2006 competition.

Queensland's councils and community organisations have been invited to nominate
towns and cities for the environmental and community development competition,
which recognises a range of achievements from visitor hospitality to resource
conservation.

Tidy Towns 2006 is run by Keep Australia Beautiful Queensland and supported by
Ergon Energy, which has been a sponsor of the strongly contested competition for
eight years.

Ergon Energy regional services manager Paul Ryan announced that the company was
this year offering a special 'clean energy' prize to Queensland's Tidiest Town.

''Ergon Energy will power a community facility or event within the winning town
with clean energy produced from renewable sources such as wind, water or
biomass,'' Mr Ryan said.

''This not only offers an added incentive for Tidy Towns entrants, but it also
provides a fitting reward for the winner - clean energy to make your town even
cleaner.

''As a large Queensland company that employs thousands of Queenslanders and
provides electricity to almost 600,000 customers, we are committed to keeping
our State beautiful.

''So this year, we will also be encouraging our employees to take a hands-on
role in the competition by initiating local clean ups and rallying support for
efforts across the state.''

Keep Australia Beautiful Queensland Communications and Programs director Liz
Kearins expects more than 250 towns and cities to enter this year's competition.

She said the Tidy Towns competition was a great way of recognising and rewarding
the outstanding environmental and community development work being undertaken in
Queensland communities.

''We encourage councils and community groups to nominate their towns for this
year's competition, and to be in the running for the coveted title of
Queensland's Tidiest Town as well as 10 outstanding accomplishment awards,'' Ms
Kearins said

''Towns are judged on environmental innovation and protection, visitor
hospitality, cultural and natural heritage preservation, community interaction,
youth initiatives, resource conservation and waste management, tidiness and
litter abatement, and local government partnerships with communities.''

2006 marks the 35th birthday of Keep Australia Beautiful and the Tidy Towns
competition in Queensland, making Tidy Towns the longest running environmental
program in the State.

Last year's winner was the seaside city of Redcliffe.

Last year, the competition attracted entries from throughout Queensland, with
the winner being the seaside city of Redcliffe.

Keep Australia Beautiful Queensland judges take into account every community's
geographic, environmental and economic circumstances, and assess how efficiently
and effectively the community uses the resources available to it against a range
of criteria.

This year, as well as the title of Queensland's Tidiest Town, entrants will
compete for 10 outstanding accomplishment awards.

Nominations close on Friday, 10 February 2006, with competition judging taking
place between March and June.

New battle brewing

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 602 words


Residents northwest of Cochrane are furious they're having to battle a second
gas plant proposed for their area, less than a year after fighting off another
project.

Vista Nuova Energy Inc. - which wants to build a sweet gas plant in a region of
rolling hills covered with farms and forests - said the plant will generate $
35,000 to $ 40,000 a year in tax revenues for the Municipal District of Rocky
View.

Lorenzo Donadeo, Vista Nuova's vice-president of production and marketing, said
the gas plant, 17 kilometers northwest of Cochrane, "would also create jobs and
a considerable amount of royalties and corporate taxes - millions of dollars
over the life of the project.

"Contrary to what some of the opponents of this are saying, there's considerable
industrial and residential development in the area," Donadeo said, noting other
gas development in the region.

He added the biggest impact in the area is the clearing undertaken for farming
and subdivision.

He said that the Vista Nuova gas plant would give off the same emissions as cars
- nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.

Rocky View council, asked by Vista Nuova to rezone the proposed plant site from
agricultural to industrial earlier this week, decided to defer its decision
until late June to allow for more public consultation. The Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ERCB) holds its public hearing into the issue at 9 a.m. June
21 at the Dartigue Community Hall near Bottrell.

Environmental consultant Syril Garvey, working for Vista Nuova, told the council
that no natural habitat will be destroyed because the immediate area has already
been disturbed by agricultural activities.

But rancher Buck Miller - who owns a natural area, that has never been cleared,
adjacent to the site - said the development could be devastating for the moose,
deer, blue herons, hawks, geese, songbirds and beaver living on his land.

Nature photographer Keith Logan said the entire area is special because four
life zones - prairie, parkland, boreal forest and mountain foothills - meet
there, resulting in an incredible diversity of wildlife.

And Anne Lacey, who lives within two kilometers of the proposed plant site, has
a 41-signature petition opposing the development. Lacey said she's dead set
against it because it will create visual, noise and air pollution, lower
property values, and negatively affect wildlife, residents' quality of life and
the natural beauty of the area.

She was especially annoyed by a "simplistic" May 3 letter from Donadeo saying
wildlife in the immediate area can hopefully adjust to the plant.

"Why," asked Lacey, "should animals have to adjust when we destroy their natural
habitat and environment?"

She said the proposed plant site is surrounded by a good deal of "incredibly
beautiful" woodland and parkland.

She also was critical of Donadeo's statement that land isn't devalued by the
existence of such facilities, "but it does generally take longer to sell."

Lacey said the gas plant proposal was a terrible shock because more than 100
local residents fought a Pan Alberta Gas Ltd. proposal for a plant in the same
area. Pan Alberta withdrew its plans after deciding it was more economical to
have gas processed at an existing Cochrane plant.

Residents are also concerned that Westbrook School, serving Grades 1 to 8 with a
kindergarten facility attached, is about four kilometers downwind of the
proposed plant.

Nitrogen oxides contribute to ground-level ozone, and can aggravate respiratory
problems such as asthma, said Rocky Mountain House environmentalist Martha
Kostuch.

EMPLOYERS CAN'T IGNORE AIDS WORRY

BYLINE: CAROL HOWES

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. I1

LENGTH: 715 words


Linda Hutchinson has heard it time and time again from employees: they won't be
infected with the AIDS virus because they don't belong to marginalized groups.

Well, Hutchinson has some nasty news for them.

She's travelling around the province with consultant Robert Reid to dispel the
myth and inform more than 600 people working for the Energy Resources
Conservation Board about the realities of HIV and AIDS and the devastating
effect they can have on the workplace.

In a forward-thinking, pro-active move, the ERCB is developing an extensive AIDS
policy and is offering an organization-wide education program to its employees
about the facts surrounding HIV and AIDS.

Hutchinson, who co-ordinates the ERCB's employee assistance program, says that
as in the general population, many at the board are "ignorant or misinformed."

"I know from my colleagues that not a lot has been done (in the workplace) on
the subject. I've just chosen to make it a priority."

The team, which includes Robert Reid, a Calgary consultant who lends his
expertise on AIDS and HIV to organizations, has travelled as far as northern
Alberta to see workers in field offices.

"The program has been very well received," says Hutchinson. "Most people have
learned something. Most people are shocked by the statistics. The fact that
people are coming in droves tells us something."

Programs on health issues such as high-blood pressure, smoking and stress are
common at most companies, but AIDS education has been much slower getting into
the workplace.

A recent survey in the U.S. found that 75 per cent of employees wanted their
employers to provide AIDS education, but only 28 per cent received it.

According to Reid, the Canadian AIDS Society surveyed 2,000 Canadian companies
in late 1991 and early 1992 and found that just over half had a policy on AIDS
or were creating one. But of those, only 29 per cent had an education program,
and only nine per cent had a policy employees were actually aware of.

In Calgary, interest in AIDS education programs is still new. Few companies have
the kind of extensive AIDS policy the ERCB will have completed by October.

Yet, Reid says, with the incidence of HIV infection growing (according to the
Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta between one in 100 and one in 250 people
are potentially HIV infected and may or may not know) all companies and
organizations have an obligation to educate employees and will all eventually
have to address HIV and AIDS as an issue of corporate policy.

"In Calgary a lot of people still think it just doesn't happen here," says Reid.
"People still think it only happens to homosexuals. Well, not by a long shot."

Reid says companies, whether aware of it or not, are facing a major health --
and economic -- issue when it comes to HIV and AIDS.

"It's having a major economic impact," he says, pointing to a long list of
associated costs including the loss of skilled workers, the cost of recruiting
to replace them, workplace disruption, reduced productivity and health care
costs.

He says companies need a specific policy for HIV and AIDS because issues could
arise in their organization such as a co-worker who refuses to work with an HIV
infected colleague.

"A big part of having a successful policy is an educational program," adds Reid,
formerly a volunteer with AIDS Calgary.

"There's so much ignorance and misinformation out there it causes a lot of
problems."

He says educational programs provide accurate information about transmission,
prevention and risk reduction, as well as how HIV and AIDS can affect the
workplace.

Employees need to be made aware of human rights issues related to HIV and AIDS,
he adds.

An employer, for instance, cannot turn an employee away because he or she is
infected with HIV or has AIDS. Also, an employer has an obligation to make
reasonable accommodations for an HIV infected person including job modification
and flexible scheduling.

"HIV and AIDS have generated more lawsuits than any other illness in history,"
notes Reid.

He says companies have phoned him in a panic because they have encountered
problems surrounding HIV and AIDS, and have not known what to do about them.

"Companies have to anticipate and prevent," he says.

In a story published July 11 on Nova Corp.'s plans following its acquisition of
Polysar Ltd., Nova President Jim Butler should have been quoted as saying that
no one can build a plant under the recommendations of the ERCB, a comment on the
Energy Resources Conservation Board's recommendations for government control of
industry use of ethane feedstock.

The story also should have reported Mr. Butler as saying that the acquisition
would not be going ahead if any part of Polysar's current operations had been
excluded from the deal, commenting on speculation that olysar might seek to
continue the sale of parts of its rubber business.

LACK OF EVACUATION PLANNING ANGERS ACTIVIST

BYLINE: WENDY DUDLEY

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 296 words


Sour gas leak sparks fears

A sour gas activist fears people will die if a sour gas leak develops in
heavily-populated northeast Calgary, a region including numerous natural gas and
oil wells containing deadly hydrogen sulphide.

It's "ironic", Anil Giga said Sunday, that residents were given the option of
evacuating when a sour gas leak developed on a pipeline near Sundre Friday, yet
there is no evacuation plan for the northeast Calgary communities.

In the case of a leak, evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 northeast residents would
be impossible, said Giga, spokesman for the Coral Springs community.

Giga believes there should be an increase in distance between wells and
residential areas something he has unsuccessfully lobbied for from the Energy
Resources Conservation Board.

"There's no option of evacuation, and there's no increase in setback distances .
. . I fear there could be a catastrophe. But no one talks about the lives that
could be endangered."

ERCB officials could not be reached Sunday, but in the past, a senior inspector
has said evacuation plans do exist for all areas near sour-gas producing wells.

Meanwhile, Shell Canada and government agencies continued clean-up operations on
the Red Deer River, 10 kilometres northeast of Sundre, following a leak which
occurred in a section of pipe running under the river.

"There's still some condensate (a gasoline-like substance) appearing in the
river . . . and we're trying to determine the cause," said Shell's public
affairs representative Laurieanne Lynne.

Tests have concluded that the water is of "drinking" quality, she said.

Alberta Environment and Alberta Fish and Wildlife are testing the leak's impact
on aquatic life, and results are expected later this week.

POWER LINE CAUSING LITTLE CONCERN

BYLINE: DAVID STEINHART

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 225 words


Residents living west of the city limits in East Springbank have expressed very
little concern over a new $ 3-million power line scheduled to go up in their
area sometime next year.

Area landowners had until last Thursday to voice concerns over the power line,
but only 14 came forward, said electric system spokesman Eric Cameron.

"We're very surprised by the low number of responses," he said. "I'm not going
to speculate and say it will go through no problem, but we will hold an internal
meeting (Tuesday) to see where we are."

City council has already approved the $ 3-million expenditure. The electric
system needs approval from the Energy Resources Conservation Board, which has
yet to make a ruling.

Plans for the power line which will be five kilometres long, running from
TransAlta's substation at 50th Avenue and Sarcee Trail S.W., north to the city's
substation at 101st Street and Bearspaw Dam Road S.W. have not been finalized,
said Cameron.

"Even though there have been a small number of concerns filed, we still want to
have a look at them and review them," said Cameron. "I understand about half are
in favor of our preferred (power line) route, the other half against.

"It could go to a public hearing, but that would be very expensive," he said.
"We want to work out acceptable compromises with the ERCB."

Whaleback clear sign of system breakdown

BYLINE: DAVID YAGER, FREELANCE WRITER

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 990 words


Land-use conflicts in Alberta have finally escalated to the point where the
regulatory system for oil and gas development is becoming unworkable.

In the normal course of business, the provincial government is now collecting
money from oil companies for Crown mineral leases, cashing the cheques and
spending the money, and not providing the company the necessary permits to drill
an exploratory well to evaluate or exploit its investment.

If you did this to another person, it would be illegal.

Implicit in any commercial transaction is the delivery of something after
accepting money. Say you collect a cash down payment to sell a piece of real
estate, then don't close the deal and refuse to refund the deposit. You'd be in
court in a heartbeat and, barring technicalities, found guilty of fraud or
theft.

Court is where the oil industry and the Alberta government are headed if new and
understandable regulations on land use aren't developed and soon.

The oil business, or any business, cannot function in a system that collects
money without delivering something in return.

From a purely corporate perspective, that's how things look following a recent
Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) decision to reject Amoco Canada's
application to test its mineral lease at Whaleback with an exploratory well.

The system is finally breaking down, and the implications for all Albertans are
significant.

That's why last week, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP)
requested that the Klein government move ahead with the stalled Special Places
2000 initiative to determine forever what parts of Alberta are open for oil and
gas exploration and development, and what parts will be set aside for posterity.

The oilpatch wants the government and public to decide once and for all where it
can operate under regulations that everybody understands. Until this issue is
resolved, Alberta's reputation as a fair and profitable place to do business
remains blemished.

Special Places 2000 is a significant document.

Originally conceived by Premier Ralph Klein when he was a minister in the Getty
administration, Special Places defines what sort of areas should be declared
closed for development and how much land should be involved.

A year ago, the province released a discussion paper which suggested that up to
30 per cent of the territory known as Alberta could be affected. The reaction by
the business community was so negative that the Klein government put the whole
project on the back burner.

That figure has been reduced to 12 per cent in recent media reports. The oil
industry wants Special Places to move ahead now because it was cited as a factor
in the ERCB's decision at Whaleback.

CAPP obviously believes that clarifying exactly what Places are Special should
solve the Whaleback dilemma for once and for all.

Should the decision be made that any significant amount of Alberta's lands are
off limits to petroleum development, the economic cost will be enormous.

The total size of Alberta's future petroleum industry will be capped that much
smaller than it might have been otherwise. What matters under this legislation
is surface use.

Even if a huge and valuable oil field lies underneath the surface, the
technology to extract oil or gas from under the ground without some surface
impact does not exist, nor will it ever exist.

The criteria to select which lands will be protected will be aesthetic, not
economic, and to a great degree arbitrary. Appearance will have been given
greater importance than economic value.

Future oil and gas discoveries will undoubtedly be found in wilderness areas
because, by definition, you discover oil or gas in places you've never looked
before.

Yet these are the areas most likely to be protected. Setting aside nothing but
undeveloped land under the Special Places concept must be preceded by a
macro-economic cost/benefit analysis. Otherwise, the damage to the petroleum
industry and the entire economy could be much greater than projected.

What is upsetting to those of us who put the unemployed ahead of the rocks and
trees is that the whole Special Places concept is already a huge victory for the
protectionist movement.

If CAPP is successful in getting the process on track to end the confusion about
where the oilpatch can operate, the debate will likely be about how much land
should be set aside, not whether the whole idea should be tossed in the garbage
can.

CAPP should be applauded for forcing this critical issue back onto the public
agenda. What must accompany any debate about Special Places is the true cost to
each and every taxpayer.

If, after a full and public airing of the facts, the province decides on our
behalf that 12 per cent of Alberta, including Whaleback, must be protected from
petroleum development, I assume the province will refund Amoco its money, plus
interest.

Let's at least go broke honestly.

etired chairman of Nova Corp. has offered to give the government $ 500,000 now
or $ 1 million in his will if it goes to debt reduction.

He estimated that the 600,000 Canadians who hold at least $ 2 million each in
assets could cut the debt by $ 15 billion through a fund-drive.

The key, he noted, is overcoming the public's cynical mistrust of government and
the entirely legitimate fear that the contribution would only be squandered.

Then, there is Carl McNeill, an antidote to cynicism.

The bachelor farmer was born before Wilfrid Laurier became prime minister and
died in February, a month after his 100th birthday. He lived most of his life on
a farm outside Stratford, Ont., without electricity or running water.

He lived within his means, never understanding, these past 20 years, why the
government failed to do likewise.

He acted rather than spoke. He gave more than he got.

I hope the finance minister dedicates his budget this February to his memory.

EAR, EAR: AFTER A CAREER SPENT LISTENING, OILPATCH VETERAN FINDS HIS TALENTS ARE
IN DEMAND ELSEWHERE

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 841 words


Gerry DeSorcy says he got the message during his 38 years as an increasingly
powerful architect of Alberta's oil, natural gas, electricity and forestry
industries.

The engineer admits he did not easily come by patience to listen to long, often
emotional pleas by outsiders and amateurs like farmers, natives and
environmentalists.

Yet he became famous among promoters and critics of industrial projects alike,
as someone willing to hear out all sides no matter how long it took.

"It certainly didn't come naturally," says the veteran of marathon public
hearings in drafty community halls and stuffy motels from Caroline to Fort
McMurray.

"Some of those speeches were longer than three hours," he says, in recalling
cases he presided over as chairman of Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation
Board and Natural Resources Conservation Board.

"It's really been a recognition over the years that the people who participate
in these hearings have concerns and a story they want to tell," DeSorcy said in
an interview.

"Even though some of us may feel they're somewhat repetitive, they want to tell
their stories in their own words. People want to have their say."

As DeSorcy retires from the ERCB and NRCB at the age of 59, his message to
Alberta's biggest industries is that they too must learn to listen.

"Early, meaningful communication between the proponents of projects and the
public is very important, even if it means delay and costs money at first.

"Even in terms of the bottom line over the long haul of projects' lifespans for
25 years or 35 years and more, early and meaningful involvement of the public
pays dividends."

DeSorcy insists that even though they may be vastly bigger, richer and more
advanced in technology, "these projects are neighbors to others like the Indian
bands and the agricultural industry.

"Almost invariably, there are better relations where this has been recognized
and the industry has involved the public early."

The son of a Drumheller coal miner said this idea of co-operation was as foreign
to him as it was to the province's early industrialists when he joined the ERCB
staff after graduating in 1955 as a petroleum engineer from the University of
Alberta.

"No one, unless they had seen an ERCB inspector that afternoon, even knew the
board existed. It was a different world. The public didn't expect to have
input."

He recalls that when the first Calgary-area plant for "sour" gas, laced with
lethal hydrogen-sulphide, was built, there was no counterpart to the marathon
safety inquiry and community-relations efforts triggered by current drilling
proposals.

In the 1950s, the issues were economic. Industry just had to show its methods
yielded maximum production, revenues and provincial royalties. Efficiency
drives, more than environmental concerns, drove work to extract the sulphur from
sour gas.

And the public just did not show up: "It was almost totally an internal matter,"
DeSorcy remembered.

"A lot of things have changed. There are over 500 gas plants now and 100,000
wells. There are a lot more people. Attitudes have changed. We're a different
society."

DeSorcy praises big industry for being responsible by responding to increasingly
sensitive communities and provincial authorities, by letting Albertans in on
their plans.

As a model, he points to Syncrude Canada Ltd. The Fort McMurray oilsands plant
set a record by winning approval for a massive plant expansion in the 1980s
after an ERCB hearing that lasted just a few hours to hear out a single, minor
public protest.

He said Syncrude avoided weeks of costly, acrimonious hearings by bringing
community groups and agencies such as environmental authorities into its
planning process and adjusting the proposal to satisfy all the "stakeholders."

Although DeSorcy explained that he retired early rather than disrupt a
reorganization now under way at the ERCB by returning to it after finishing an
18-month assignment to set up the new NRCB, he is far from finished as an
Alberta figure.

He is about to start teaching on a global scale the lessons he learned on the
staff of the ERCB between 1955 and 1975, then as a member and chairman of the
law court-like board until his departure this month.

He confirms he has made a trip to Russia, for some preliminary checking into a
society that stands where Alberta did when he joined the ERCB - just starting to
invent a system for letting in but controlling resource development by private
industry. He says other international work is developing.

DeSorcy said it is premature to disclose the projects. But industry sources
predict he will play a major role on a foreign-aid team that the federal
government has hired Calgary-based Paladin Projects International Ltd. to
assemble.

The plan, disclosed by former energy minister Jake Epp, calls for the consortium
of veteran consultants to instruct Russians and give them a complete, elaborate
manual on Alberta energy-industry legislation, regulation, procedures and
policies.

Amoco knew the risks at Whaleback

BYLINE: ISABELLE SCHMELZER, SPECIAL TO THE HERALD

SECTION: EDITORIAL; GUEST COLUMN; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 650 words


Isabelle Schmelzer recently graduated from the University of Guelph with a
degree in natural resources management and biology.

On reading impassioned pleas on behalf of the oil and gas industry and its
drilling plans for the Whaleback, one is left with the lingering impression of
defenceless companies bullied into bankruptcy by environmental groups and
government.

Unfortunately, the arguments regarding the recent Energy Resources Conservation
Board (ERCB) decision to deny Amoco's application to drill for sour gas in the
Whaleback are based on superficial understanding of the processes governing
development in the oil and gas industry, economics and the Special Places 2000
initiative.

While it is true that oil companies must pay a fee to the provincial government
in the form of crown mineral leases, the attainment of such a lease does not
itself guarantee the right to develop these resources.

Legally, the lease grants the right to the minerals, but not to the surface
directly overlying the resource, nor the right to physically get access to the
resources (i.e. drill the well).

In the case of the Whaleback, Amoco was able to obtain both the Crown Mineral
and Surface leases from the Alberta government, but was denied the right to
drill by the ERCB.

This decision, in effect, immobilized Amoco by rendering useless the rights
granted by the previous two leases. No injustice was committed: the explicit
right to develop Crown lands is legally not part of the "deal."

Oil and gas companies are well aware of this. It is part of the risk of doing
business. The risk has been negligible in the past.

However, the precedent set by the Whaleback case has significantly raised the
ante -- enough to make the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and
self-styled anti-environmental vigilantes nervous.

An interesting dimension is added to the Whaleback case when one considers the
level of public involvement at each of the various stages of the application
process.

Economic rationale are often cited as grounds inhibiting conservation.
Tragically, our current neoclassical economic system is inherently unsustainable
and does not allow for monetary valuation of important biological components
such as biodiversity and habitat quality.

In spite of this, a recent Statistics Canada survey of the importance of
wildlife to Canadians indicates that revenue from non-consumptive uses of
wildlife exceeds hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

A comprehensive cost/benefit analysis -- or a full cost-accounting -- would
better reflect the revenues at the microeconomic level, as well as the
economically intangible uniqueness of the Whaleback ecosystem.

However, until ecological attributes are given economic "voice," a
confrontational relationship between economics and the environment will continue
to exist.

Finally, there has been considerable misinformation about the Special Places
2000 initiative.

Rather than an arbitrary protectionist policy based solely on aesthetics, SP2000
is part of the international World Commission on the Environment and
Development's Endangered Spaces program.

The purpose of this program is to establish a network of protected areas based
on scientific information which divides the country, and each province, into
several natural regions.

In 1992, the Alberta government finally tabled the SP2000 initiative in response
to the Endangered Spaces campaign.

However, the proposal has not been implemented. As a result, Alberta is the sole
province that has failed to commit itself to the policy framework on which to
base a protected-areas system -- a factor which contributed to its "C" grade in
the latest World Wildlife Fund's "wilderness report card."

Is Amoco a victim of a greedy and powerful environmentalist movement? The answer
is a resounding "no" on legal, economic and ecological grounds.

NO ONE INJURED IN GAS EXPLOSION

BYLINE: HERALD STAFF

SECTION: CITY; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 114 words


A fiery explosion at a sour gas well in southwestern Alberta was being monitored
Friday night by provincial officials.

A four-metre-high flame was burning in a three-metre-wide crater at the site
located south of Twin Butte, about 250 kilometres southwest of Calgary.

The incident happened at 2:20 p.m. Friday. No injuries were reported at the
site, operated by Palmer Ranch Ltd., the Energy Resources Conservation Board,
said in a news release.

Six homes are located within six kilometres of the well site, but no evacuation
has been ordered...

Well control experts from Safety Boss and Alberta Environment officials were
travelling to the site Friday night.

Whaleback may go back to board

BYLINE: Peter Morton

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 336 words

DATELINE: Ottawa, Ont.


Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. will not appeal to the Alberta cabinet for permission
to drill in the province's environmentally sensitive Whaleback area.

Instead, said spokesman Vince Rodych, Amoco will likely take its case anew to
the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board, which on Sept. 8 rejected the
company's proposal for a $25-million exploration program in the Whaleback area,
which lies in the Alberta Foothills 120 kilometres southwest of Calgary.

''We see no merit in an appeal to the government,'' Rodych said yesterday. But
he added that Amoco Canada has not yet made a final decision on the route it
will take to try to win access to as much as 1.2 trillion cubic feet of gas in
the Foothills.

Amoco Canada's decision to drop a possible appeal - one of the options it was
looking at - came after Alberta Premier Ralph Klein told The Financial Post this
week that only Amoco Canada was to blame for its rejection by the conservation
board. Klein also said the provincial cabinet would not consider an appeal.

Rodych said that while Amoco Canada is prepared to correct several technical
deficiencies identified by the board, including ensuring that the company can
meet land-use regulations, Rodych insisted the provincial government has to make
some decisions on whether the area will be later designated as off-limits
wilderness and how to limit access by other groups, such as hunters.

''We need some clarification of land-use issues,'' he said.

During the 10-day hearing in May, Amoco Canada tried to convince the board that
its use of sophisticated drilling techniques, reducing the number of
conventional wells to five from 20, would reduce any environmental damage.

The board said Amoco Canada did not prove during its presentation that it could
drill in the region and still meet land-use regulations. Environmental groups
had argued the area should be off-limits to oil and gas companies because of its
unique ecology, including some rare mountain grasses.

Boulder and the nation have been buzzing with talk of Xcel Energy's new Smart
Grid, but it's still an abstraction for most people -- not many have actually
seen a "smart" home.

Curious folks will now have the chance to visit a Smart Grid house at the Center
for ReSource Conservation's annual Tour of Solar and Green Homes.

The tour covers 14 houses, including one of the first Boulder homes equipped
with Smart Grid technology.

"By being on the tour, they're going to be able to see what some of this
equipment looks like," said Andrew McKenna, owner of the Smart Grid home on the
tour. "That always helps people understand what it is."

McKenna installed the Smart Grid technology in his house two years ago, before
Xcel began transforming Boulder into its first "Smart Grid city." McKenna has
the same technology that Xcel is offering to its customers made by a company
called GridPoint.

On the tour, McKenna will exhibit his whole-house meter, which monitors all the
energy consumed by his household and the amount of energy that his solar system
is putting back

on the grid. He will also be able to show people his load manager, with which he
can use the Web to access energy consumption -- down to the circuit level -- so
he can see how much energy individual appliances use.

"It empowers you to make decisions about how a home uses energy," McKenna said.
"It will help enable homeowners to conserve energy in their own homes by giving
them information."

Xcel will bring a trailer full of equipment, engineers and scientists to the
Tour of Solar and Green Homes to explain the Smart Grid options.

The infrastructure will soon be in place throughout Boulder. Now, Smart Grid is
reaching more and more neighborhoods where people are receiving letters, asking
if they want the equipment that McKenna already has to monitor and meter
household energy use.

Every house in Boulder will soon receive a SmartMeter, but the in-house units to
help manage electricity aren't mandatory.

Drilling opponents confident

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 215 words


Opponents of drilling in the southern Alberta foothills of the Rocky Mountains
are counting on a victory as early as this week against Amoco Canada Petroleum
Co.

Protesters predicted Saturday they will defeat Amoco in a decision on the
Whaleback, about 200 kilometres southwest of Calgary, by the Energy Resources
Conservation Board.

Defenders of the area, organized as Friends of the Whaleback, are already
preparing their victory party against drilling plans by the subsidiary of
Chicago-based Amoco Corp., spokesman James Tweedie said.

He predicted success for the campaign as it packed up a protest encampment in
place since Aug. 8.

The protesters set up an ornamental wishing well on Amoco's proposed drilling
site. The well was filled with scraps of paper bearing wishes written by
supporters of the resistance. Copies are being sent to Amoco, Premier Ralph
Klein and his cabinet.

Tweedie said the group will consider appealing to the courts if the ERCB lets
Amoco drill, although he added the protesters do not have much money to lodge a
lawsuit.

He predicted the ERCB will make a decision that showed it "listened to
convincing arguments. If they let Amoco in, they'll lose all the credibility
they have with a major part of the environmental community."

Ziff wins  one for 'little guy'

BYLINE: John Shiry

SECTION: SECTION 3, THE MARKETS; Pg. 22, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 798 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Paul Ziff has made a reputation doing battle for the ''little guys'' in the
natural gas business. He recently challenged Nova Corp. and appears to have
scored at least an initial victory.

Nova is the pipeline system that gathers natural gas from Alberta producers and
delivers it to industrial customers, local gas utilities and the major export
pipelines.

Ziff argued that Nova's expansion since 1988 has been so large that the capacity
to collect and deliver gas within Alberta exceeds the capacity of the pipelines
leaving Alberta. This imbalance between ''receipt capacity'' and ''delivery
capacity'' has created a bottleneck within Alberta. Ziff claims the excess
capacity has doubled to more than four billion cubic feet a day from about two
billion cf/d in 1988.

The result is fierce competition that is responsible for low spot prices. The
short-term spot prices lead to lower one-year contracts and that in turn has
undermined the longer term contracts, including the annual review of prices to
Ontario consumers and the hotly disputed California supply pool. Historically,
these two markets have been the backbone of the Western gas industry.

Ziff's analysis is challenged on a number of counts, especially by Nova. But the
issue is getting a lot of attention in the oil patch.

The core of his argument is that Nova's growth has not been subject to the sort
of regulatory review that would examine all implications of additional capacity.
In the absence of public hearings to assess expansion plans, Nova has grown
without concern for the underlying economics of the gas business.

He also claims that Nova's construction costs are higher than they should be.
This adds unnecessarily to the pipeline's rate base on which part of the
customer tolls are calculated.

Nova's rate base (investment in the pipeline system) has grown rapidly. Ziff
estimates it will pass $4 billion in 1995 compared to just $1.4 billion when
this expansion started in 1988-89. That has pushed up the cost producers have to
pay Nova in tolls for moving all their gas, with the result that net-backs -
producers' net revenue after costs - have been squeezed: once by Nova and a
second time by the fall in prices.

Starting back in March, Ziff called for a review of Nova's operating methods by
the provincial Energy Resources Conservation Board, pointing out that the last
overall review of Alberta issues was over 10 years ago.

Last week the ERCB asked the industry for ''submissions on the operation of the
Nova natural gas transmission system.'' One topic for discussion is ''criteria
for system design and expansion - including the philosophy underlying physical
design, economic justification for added facilities, and the planning cycle.''
Round one goes to Ziff.

Paul Ziff set up his own consulting firm in 1982 to help gas producers deal with
the changes that were happening in their business. At the time, TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd. was having trouble meeting the optimistic sales targets it had
set and was not taking gas it had contracted to buy. Its agreements with
producers included standard take-or-pay provisions, meaning TCPL was paying for
gas it was not shipping.

To avert a financial catastrophe, the company negotiated relief from those
obligations. Ziff represented a large number of producers in the discussions and
was credited with forcing TCPL to improve on the initial terms offered. He has
been involved in most important gas industry issues over the last decade.

Prior to starting the consulting company, he had spent time as an oil and gas
analyst at a major brokerage firm and as an economist with the Alberta Petroleum
Marketing Commission. The APMC markets the province's share of oil production
and acts as an independent adviser to the energy minister, so Harvard-educated
Ziff had a solid apprenticeship in how the industry works.

The Ziff Energy Group now employs a staff of 14 and does annual studies on
exploration and development costs and operating costs. One division advises
companies on mergers and acquisitions. The group recently added a regulatory
consulting practice and expects to represent companies before the National
Energy Board when the board moves to Calgary this fall.

Nova disagrees with Ziff's analysis and in another column, I will outline the
Nova case. Nova pipeline division president Bruce Simpson told a luncheon
audience last week that: ''We do not construct the system 'on spec' '' and
pointed out that ''the pipeline system continues to operate at or near available
capacity throughout the year.''

In the meantime, Ziff has won the review he called for. The issues will now be
debated before the ERCB rather than in front of business luncheon audiences and
local journalists.

(USDA) seeks to lease office space in Pulaski (Giles County), TN"

Solicitation No: NRCS-TN-17-05

Notice Type: Presolicitation
Posted Date: September 26, 2016

Description: The Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA, currently
occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Pulaski, TN, that
will be expiring on January 31, 2017. The Government is seeking to lease
approximately 3,300 rentable square feet yielding 3,000 ANSI/BOMA office area
square feet of fully serviced office space in Pulaski, TN. Space offered must be
within the city limits of Pulaski and must meet all state and local building
regulations and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). New
or existing space with renovations will be considered. Space must be available
for occupancy by February 1, 2017. All services, supplies, utilities, and
janitorial (full service lease) are to be provided as part of the rental
consideration. The lease term is 10 years. The lease will have a 120-day
termination clause.


The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In
making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the
availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's
requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as
physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication
infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.
Expression of Interest should include the following:
1. Building name and address, or site location and approximate address (if
known)

KOSTUCH CALLS FOR CLEAN-UP PLAN

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 442 words


Alberta needs a "reclamation plan" for cleaning up after pipeline leaks, says an
Alberta environmentalist living in an area hit by recent pipeline problems.

Rocky Mountain House environmentalist Martha Kostuch said Friday that the plan
should be developed with public input because sometimes damage caused by a
cleanup is worse than that caused by the spill -- "and that's wrong."

Amoco Petroleum Company Ltd. is the latest corporation to suffer a pipeline
leak. In an area 25 kilometres north of Sundre, four of six pipelines on a steep
slope buckled in late June and early July, spilling "a minor amount" of crude
oil, Amoco public relations director Dan Kane confirmed Friday.

(Although the leak was 60 metres from the James River, contaminants didn't spill
into the river.)

Last January, a Shell Canada Limited pipeline beneath the James River developed
a pinhole leak that resulted in a sour gas release and river contamination.

Kostuch protested that reclamation plans are left up to the company with "token"
approval of the cleanup given by the Energy Resources Conservation Board and
provincial environmental department.

Kostuch is now demanding a public review of the Shell problem to determine how
it happened, the impact and what could be done better in future.

"I believe cleanup in many of these cases is doing more damage the the leak
did," she said.

"Sometimes nature does a better job of cleaning up than we do."

In cleanup of the Shell case, a river channel of the Red Deer River was diked,
an "enormous" section of riverbed was dug up, condensate was put into the air,
and the clean-up effort probably burned more hydrocarbons than were released in
the spill, she said.

It could take a century for the river to completely recover from the cleanup,
she argued, noting that over-zealous cleanups could be the result of companies
reacting to new provincial environmental legislation that can see corporate
directors go to jail if "due diligence" isn't shown in addressing pollution
problems.

However, Shell spokeswoman Laurianne Lynn characterized the cleanup completed
April 1 as thoroughly responsible.

Re-channelling and diking of the river were necessary to contain condensate, she
said.

The site was returned as closely as possible to its original condition, and the
company worked close with Alberta Environmental Protection and the ERCB in
reclamation, she said.

ERCB spokeswoman Simone Marler said the organization's pipeline inspectors in
the field monitor a site from the time a spill is reported -- and it must be
reported immediately -- until it's properly cleaned up and reclaimed.

Nova fights back against Ziff's jab

BYLINE: John Shiry

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT & FINANCE; Pg. 18, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 835 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


    In recent months, Calgary consultant Paul Ziff has charged Nova
 Corp. with building too much pipeline capacity and as a result forcing gas
prices down (Oil Patch column, July 4). He called for a hearing to air the
matter.

Nova's Bruce Simpson answered, ''The pipeline system continues to run at or near
capacity throughout the year.'' He blames other factors for the low prices in
the Alberta spot market. He also told producers to blame themselves for
accepting low prices for their gas: ''Don't say: Nova made me do it.''

The public mud-slinging is unusual. In the oil patch, many serious issues are
resolved between competing parties without resort to such pointed public debate.
Late in June, the provincial Energy Resources Conservation Board took the hint
and called for submissions on all matters relating to the Nova issue.

Simpson, president of the pipeline division, outlined the Nova case at a
business luncheon a few days later.

Nova's operating methods result from the company's mandate to provide service on
a ''universal and non-discriminatory'' basis. Any producer that can show it has
gas reserves and that asks for firm transportation service will be connected to
the pipeline.

The Nova pipeline system covers much of Alberta. It gathers natural gas
throughout the province and delivers it to local utilities, to industrial
customers and to the long-distance pipelines that go to markets in the U.S. and
other parts of Canada.

Initially called Alberta Gas Trunk Line Co., the company was created in the
1950s by the provincial government of Premier Ernest Manning. AGTL was a
government-created monopoly designed, in part, to prevent the eastern-based
TransCanada PipeLines system from reaching inside Alberta.

This had the effect of ending the regulatory authority of the National Energy
Board over pipeline operation and construction at the Alberta border. AGTL, the
Nova pipeline system, is subject to provincial regulation.

Ziff has been telling audiences that provincial regulation fails to make sure
the Nova system does a good job of matching its capacity with that of the
transmission lines leaving Alberta.

To the charge that receipt capacity has been allowed to outstrip delivery
capacity, creating a gas surplus in Alberta (and fierce competition for spot
sales), Simpson says the numbers show that Nova is not responsible for low
prices. The historic ratio that receipt capacity is about 1.2 times delivery
capacity has been maintained.

Nova's present construction schedules have been paced to meet the new capacity
needed to serve TCPL's deliveries on the Iroquois system to the U.S. northeast
starting in late 1992. Simpson points out those deliveries were initially
scheduled to start in 1991, so Nova did get a little ahead of TCPL's capacity.
As a result, the receipt-delivery ratio has risen from its traditional 1.2 times
to a peak of 1.3 times this year and should drop back to 1.2 times in 1993-94 as
the Iroquois system moves to full capacity.

Nova's growth is fuelled by producer requests for firm service to deliver gas to
the growing U.S. market.

The so-called ''Alberta bottleneck'' is really the maturing of the Alberta gas
market. For the period from 1985 through 1989, deliveries within Alberta grew by
an average of 12% a year compared to growth in border deliveries of just 4.6% a
year. Nova expects the Alberta market to grow by only 1.6% a year from 1990
through 1995 while the export market should grow by 5.6% a year.

To Ziff's argument that the 27-36 months it takes to get new capacity connected
is unjustified, Simpson says that new receipt connections can average eight to
10 months where all that's required is a field connection.

But the 27-month cycle is typical when a service request necessitates the design
and construction of new mainline pipe with large compressor installations and
when construction schedules have to fit into short activity periods. Much of
northern Alberta is accessible to heavy equipment only during the winter
freeze-up.


Simpson claims the Nova record for building new pipe stacks up favorably against
the time taken by other North American pipelines.

The dispute over Nova is now headed to a full-blown inquiry before the
provincial ERCB. A great deal may be at stake. One issue that will likely be
aired is the postage-stamp toll. All producers pay the same charge for the same
class of service, regardless of the distance the gas has to be shipped.

This is part of providing service on a non-discriminatory basis. But it also has
the effect of subsidizing northern and other remote gas fields at the expense of
more accessible areas.

On the broad issue of Nova's performance, the pipeline does not have a mandate
to manage the speed or location of Alberta resource development or to choose who
can and cannot have access to markets.


The hearings will provide a forum in which the future of Alberta's gas industry
will be debated.

Environmental orders come before creditors

BYLINE: James Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 43, THE LAW

LENGTH: 589 words


Receivers must obey environmental clean-up orders before paying secured
creditors, says the Alberta Court of Appeal.

In the recent ruling in Panamericana vs Northern Badger, the unanimous court
directed the receiver to abandon Northern Badger's oil wells according to an
order of the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board.

The court knew this would leave almost nothing to pay Panamericana's
$1.3-million claim against Northern Badger's assets.

Abandonment of an oil well is a technical term referring to the sealing of a
drill hole at the end of the well's useful life to make it environmentally safe.

Northern Badger was licensed to operate 31 oil wells. It gave a floating charge
debenture over its assets to Panamericana in November 1985.

About 18 months later, Northern Badger failed. A receiver-manager was appointed
by the court and Panamericana obtained a $1.3-million judgment against the
bankrupt company.

The receiver tried to sell the bankrupt's interests in the wells. The sales
agreement contained a provision allowing the purchaser to give back wells that
didn't produce enough to pay for their abandonment.

The court did not notice this clause but went ahead and approved the sale.
Eventually, seven wells were given back.

When the receiver applied to pay out to Panamericana and be released from its
duties, the environmental board got an order in council compelling the receiver
to seal up the wells in the proper manner before paying the creditor.

At the original trial, Panamericana successfully argued the order made the board
a creditor of Northern Badger.

Since Panamericana had priority, it would take all the assets, leaving nothing
to pay for the abandonment of the seven wells, which would have to be covered by
the province.

Panamericana's lawyers also convinced the trial judge that Alberta did not have
the power to pass regulations contradicting the order of paying creditors
prescribed by the federal Bankruptcy Act.

But in the court of appeal, James Laycraft, chief justice of Alberta, reversed
both of the trial judge's conclusions.

The chief justice said the board was not collecting money, rather that its
regulations for operating oil wells required the receiver to spend money to
abandon the wells.

''The regulatory regime contained in these statutes and regulations contemplates
that all wells drilled for oil and gas will one day be abandoned,'' Laycraft
said.

The board is not a creditor, according to the judge. It is a public health
authority enforcing the general law of Alberta safeguarding the health and
safety of its citizens.

If he ruled otherwise, the receiver could operate the wells, giving the profit
to the creditors. Then, when the wells became unprofitable, he could make the
province pay the bill for abandoning them.

The chief justice added that the board regulations did not directly contradict
the federal Bankruptcy Act, although they might incidentally affect distribution
because the receiver might have less money to hand out to creditors.

Calgary lawyer Ronald Wingham, who represented Panamericana in the court of
appeal, says many bankers fear the implications.

''It is possible to interpret it as saying there is no limit to the receiver's
potential environmental liability,'' he says.

''You can attempt to protect yourself by having an environmental audit before
deciding to advance money, but the difficulty is that environmental problems are
essentially unquantifiable risks.''

E. Dubuque man plans suit over coal pile; Citizen files intention to take
Alliant Energy and IEI Barge to court

BYLINE: EMILY KLEIN

SECTION: Front; Pg. a1

LENGTH: 620 words

DATELINE: EAST DUBUQUE, Ill.


Charles McEvoy is tired of cleaning coal dust off his house, inside and out.

Black particles from a coal pile located just a quarter mile away catch in the
wind and settle on every surface around, including his property.

After years of mopping, hosing and wiping, McEvoy has decided to take legal
action against IEI Barge Services Inc., the company that owns the East Dubuque
coal pile.

IEI Barge Services Inc., part of Alliant Energy Transportation, is located just
east of East Dubuque, off U.S. 20. Coal is brought to the facility via train,
then stored in a pile until it can be transported elsewhere by barge on the
Mississippi River.

McEvoy said he tried for years to work with the managers of IEI Barge Services
Inc., but they haven't corrected the dust problem to his satisfaction, so he
hired an attorney.

David Bender, McEvoy's lawyer from Madison, Wis., said the case is simple.

"You can see the coal piles and the dust. The facts are straightforward," Bender
said. "It's not even invisible pollution, it's right there, it's black and dirty
and it's a pain to live in."

This week Bender sent a notice to Alliant and IEI Barge Services officials to
inform them that McEvoy "intends to file a Clean Air Act and Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act citizen lawsuit" against the owners and operators
of the East Dubuque facility.

Sixty days notice is required under the Clean Air Act and a 90-day notice is
required under the conservation act before a citizen suit can be filed, Bender
said.

Alliant spokesman, Scott Drzycimski, said the company received some
communication from McEvoy's attorney, but hasn't received any further
information.

He said Alliant has always worked hard to be a good neighbor and has even taken
some expensive steps to reduce pollution to better the quality of life for those
in the area.

Years ago the company put up a sound barricade to reduce the noise that's made
when the railcars are shaken, a practice that loosens the coal at the bottom of
the cars. In spring 2005, it also put in a $200,000 sprinkler system to dampen
the coal so dust wouldn't blow around the neighborhood, though it doesn't
eliminate the dust completely.

"We're certainly always listening to the neighbors," he said. "We feel as if
we've done what they asked to address their needs at this point."

Bender said that, by law, everyone has a right to enjoy their property to the
fullest extent. The coal dust and other particulate pollutants are prime
examples of limiting a person's enjoyment, he said.

McEvoy doesn't open the windows in his home because the coal comes in with the
fresh breeze, leaving a black film on everything, he said.

A few months ago, McEvoy filed a Citizen's Pollution Complaint with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, but he found no satisfaction there, either.

IEPA officials inspected the site on Oct. 27 and did not confirm any violations,
Maggie Carson, IEPA spokeswoman said.

"As always, we will continue to monitor as needed and we always respond to
citizen complaints. If any violations are observed, we will act accordingly,"
Carson said.

Jim Luedeking, general manager and part owner of Vroom Auto Mall and RV Plaza,
said the vehicles on his lot need to be washed more often because of dust off
the coal pile, but that no one from Vroom has contacted IEI Barge Services about
it.

"I'm only saying it's something that has created a tremendous nuisance for not
only me, but for other people," McEvoy said. "Something has to be done, they
can't continue on this way."

IEI Barge Services started operating on the 135 acres of property in 1982. About
1.3 million tons of coal moved through the facility last year, Drzycimski said.

Altamont's at-home pipe order

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 378 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Half the steel pipe for the proposed US$580-million Altamont gas pipeline from
Alberta to Wyoming will be made in Canada, Altamont Gas Transmission Co.
announced yesterday.

Two years in advance of the proposed construction date, Altamont has placed an
order for more than $115-million worth of 30-inch diameter steel pipe with
Stelco Inc. of Toronto. Two smaller orders, amounting to $118 million in total,
have also been placed with U.S.-based Berg Steel Pipe Corp. and with Mexican
steelmaker Tubacero.

Despite stiff competition from TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and San Francisco
utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co. - backers of a rival pipeline project to
carry Canadian gas to California - and the prospect that Canadian regulators may
hold a competitive hearing on the two projects, Altamont president Ewell Muse
said that placing the pipe orders ''signals construction of a 620-mile pipeline
to the future.''

The only thing that could now stop the Altamont pipeline from being built would
be National Energy Board refusal to grant gas export permits for the project, or
Alberta government refusal to issue gas removal permits, Muse said.

He said competing bids to make pipe for the Altamont project were evaluated
''strictly on economics and on ability to produce the pipe on time.'' But the
Stelco contract dramatically raises the Canadian and Alberta content of the
project - which may weigh favorably with Canadian regulators.

Gordon Rich, vice-president and general manager of Stelco's pipeline division,
said the Altamont pipe order is Stelco's second largest of the past 10 years. He
estimated the contract will create 500 man-years of work, and will keep Stelco's
two pipe mills in Camrose, Alta., and Welland, Ont., busy for the first five
months of 1993.

Muse predicted that the Stelco order will create roughly $500-million worth of
economic activity in Canada.

In an interview yesterday, Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman said he may ask
the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board to hold a competitive hearing on
the two pipeline projects.

''My hope is that somehow the market will sort this all out, but a scenario
could develop where the government of Alberta will have to make a decision,'' he
said.

Chinese vice-premier urges closer Sino-US cooperation in energy, other areas

LENGTH: 617 words


Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency)

[Xinhua: "China-US Energy Cooperation Would Produce Win-Win Results: Chinese
Vice-Premier"]

Washington, June 16 (Xinhua) - Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan has called for
stronger cooperation between China and the United States in energy, the
environment and other related areas, saying that bilateral cooperation in these
areas would lead to win-win results.

"The Chinese government gives high priority to energy and resources conservation
and the protection of the environment. It is committed to building a
resource-conserving and environment-friendly society," Vice Premier Wang wrote
in an article published by The Financial Times on Monday in its North American
edition.

"However, China is a big and populous developing country at a stage of
accelerated industrialization and urbanization. This has led to heavy
consumption of energy and resources and made the task of protecting the
environment a daunting one," he said.

"So it is highly significant that the fourth China-US Economic Dialogue, which
will be held in the US this week, will promote long-term cooperation in energy,
the environment and other related areas," said Wang, who heads a Chinese
delegation to take part in the fourth China-US Strategic Economic Dialogue
(SED), scheduled to be held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday and Wednesday.

To meet the challenges brought about by the pressures of growing demand, Wang
said China has endeavoured to achieve the following goals: intensifying energy
and resource conservation, developing renewable energy, and actively adapting to
global climate change.

"There is a broad scope for cooperation between China and the US in energy and
environment," he wrote. "Stronger cooperation between the two countries in
energy and the environment will enable China to respond better to energy and
environmental issues and also bring about tremendous business opportunities and
handsome returns for American business."

According to the intent of the 10-year cooperation between China and the US in
energy and environmental protection, Wang said the two countries should, on the
basis of the principles of mutual complementarity and win-win progress, focus
their cooperation in energy, pollution reduction and protection of natural
resources.

The Chinese vice-premier proposed three approaches to strengthen bilateral
cooperation in these areas.

First, China and the United States should build joint laboratories or research
and development centres for energy and environmental protection technologies,
and provide platforms to promote industrial applications of such technologies.

Second, the two countries should jointly formulate and implement fiscal,
taxation, financial and trade policies to encourage innovation and cooperation
in and transfer of energy-conserving and environment-friendly technologies.

Third, the two sides should use existing multilateral and bilateral dialogue
mechanism and exchange platforms to enhance consultation and coordination,
strengthen cooperation in training, exchanges of technical personnel, and
data-sharing.

Vice-Premier Wang hoped that through dialogue and cooperation in these areas,
China and the United States will promote all-round development of the
constructive and cooperative relationship between the two countries, to better
serve the interests of their peoples.

The SED was launched jointly by Chinese President Hu Jintao and US President
George W. Bush in September of 2006. The dialogue is held twice a year,
alternating between the two countries. The previous meeting was held in December
in Beijing.

petroleum business.

The National Energy Board (NEB) and Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation
Board (ERCB) say they are tightening their belts because their workloads are
declining.

The national board has announced plans to lay off 65 employees in Ottawa and to
trim its staff by 15 per cent to 356. The layoffs will affect everyone, from
stenographers up to directors and managers.

The Calgary-based conservation board has had no dismissals. But up to 40 jobs
have been lost through a hiring freeze which bans replacing employees who quit
or retire unless their roles are deemed essential and cannot be filled by
internal transfers.

Chairman Gerry DeSorcy said more trimming is ahead for the provincial board's
remaining complement of about 770 employees, although "we're hopeful, with early
retirement, that we will not be making any layoffs."

Slumping oilfield activity has dried up work for provincial regulators and
DeSorcy said the board has had to adjust "for the states of the industry and
government coffers."

Half of the provincial board's budget is paid for through a levy on energy
companies and it is concentrating its trimming in departments were workloads
mirror oilfield activity levels, such as well licensing and drilling rig
inspections.

The National Energy Board attributes its need for cuts to market deregulation.
Abolition of the national energy program ended jobs for people who enforced
federal controls on oil and gas export prices and volumes.

The federal layoffs are gentle by industry standards, where departures are
sometimes instant.

Laid of staff get one-year notices and are helped by so-called "redeployment
counsellors." Those who do not find other work during the notice period stay on
a priority list for hiring by other branches of the federal civil service for
another 12 months.

Dismissed civil servants rarely wind up unemployed, said a board spokesman, who
estimated no more than five of the 65 workers laid off by the National Energy
Board are likely to be still hunting for a job a year from now.

$147,000 grant to promote biomass energy conservation

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 345 words


The Natural Resource Conservation Service has awarded the Forest Guild of New
Mexico a $147,000, one-year Conservation Innovation Grant to promote innovative
logging practices that sustain forests and use biomass to create energy in nine
Northeast states, including Massachusetts.

The conservation grant is a program of the Natural Resource Conservation Service
that invests in innovative conservation technologies with a goal of addressing
energy conservation and water quality and quantity, among other natural resource
issues.

Michael DeBonis, executive director of the Forest Guild, said: "To meet the
woody biomass potential as a renewable energy resource and to assure long-term
ecological sustainability, we must understand and be able to apply biomass
harvesting guidelines on the ground."

"This one-year grant, if nothing else, gives us the opportunity to get the
science right the first time," Mr. DeBonis said.

Congress is considering policy options that might require landowner use of
sustainable forest biomass guidelines to participate in incentive programs or
supply bioenergy facilities.

"Guidelines for the sustainable harvesting and retention of biomass also present
an innovative way to protect water quality and wildlife habitat while providing
additional income to landowners," Mr. DeBonis said.

The Forest Guild is one of 18 grant awardees that will be sharing in a total
grant of $329,000.

The guild and team members from the Pinchot Institute for Conservation, the
University of Maine, the University of Vermont, Manomet Center for Conservation
Sciences, and The Nature Conservancy-Pennsylvania will share their experience in
sustainable biomass harvesting guidelines and state-based best management
practices in the Northeast to lead this project.

The team will promote adoption of innovative biomass harvesting and retention
guidelines for the production, harvest, and handling of sustainable forest
biomass for use by renewable energy plants in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.

RED DEER ERCB OFFICE MOVED QUICKLY TO INVESTIGATE SOUR GAS PIPELINE LEAK

SECTION: LETTER; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 390 words


Re "Shell slow to respond, residents say," Mary Clayton, Herald, Jan. 14.

In this news story about the Shell Canada Ltd. sour gas/condensate pipeline leak
near Caroline, reference was made to the Energy Resources Conservation Board's
(ERCB) response to a public complaint about odors.

Because of the potential risk to public safety posed by sour gas leaks, all
complaints about odors are carefully logged and investigated. The ERCB is an
integral part of the sour gas emergency response system and we take our
responsibility for public safety very seriously.

The news story suggested that the ERCB office in Red Deer was unresponsive to an
odor complaint from a Dennis Overguard. The pipeline leak, which was discovered
on Jan. 7, occurred adjacent to Overguard's land under a channel of the Red Deer
River.

The story quoted Overguard as having complained to the ERCB Red Deer office of a
"severe stink" on Jan. 4. Subsequent review of ERCB phone logs indicated that
Overguard had not called on Jan. 4. Red Deer office staff contacted Overguard
about his comment and he confirmed that he had not placed the call as the Herald
reported. The first call from Dennis Overguard about the Shell incident was
logged on Jan. 7.

A further comment attributed to Overguard in the news story suggests that the
ERCB had been to his farm on Jan. 4 to monitor for odors. Unfortunately, the
story suggested that odor monitoring occurred several days before action was
taken on the pipeline leak. This was not the case. The ERCB did not conduct air
monitoring on this date or any other date but was on site to monitor Shell's
spill containment operation.

The ERCB and especially our Red Deer office wants Herald readers to know that we
place the highest priority on public safety as related to sour gas operations.
We respond to the trust that the public places in us through prevention,
consultation with the public and industry, and 24-hours-a-day emergency
preparedness. Because the public's trust is essential to our work, we felt it
necessary to respond to inaccuracies in the article.

We also believe that it is most important that the Herald confirm its material
with other reliable sources before going to print.

ED MAY,

Red Deer.

(May is the Red Deer area supervisor for the Energy Resources Conservation
Board.)

Producers protest Alberta gas limit

BYLINE: Deirdre McMurdy

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 443 words


  Long-term natural gas export contracts from Alberta could be in jeopardy
because of the provincial government's refusal to grant licences for longer than
15 years.

Producers are convinced that the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board is
sending the wrong signals to U.S. gas customers, who are increasingly concerned
with long-term security of supply in their natural gas contracts.

''The whole gas market is evolving - there's more interest than ever in
long-term, firm sales,'' said Craig Stewart, vice-president of gas marketing at
Poco Petroleums Ltd.

But the ERCB is refusing to allow Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. to proceed with a
$4.6-billion contract to supply gas to the lucrative California market over the
next 24 years.

The ERCB is adhering to its established 15-year export term, despite the fact
that the National Energy Board has granted Pan-Alberta permission to remove the
gas from Canada.

That could pose problems for two other Canadian gas producers, Canadian Hunter
Ltd. and Sceptre Resources Ltd., which recently concluded 20-year export
contracts with U.S. utility customers.

Canadian Hunter has won approval from the National Energy Board to supply gas to
a New York co-generation project, but the ERCB has yet to rule on the
US$70-million deal.

The ERCB's stance on Pan-Alberta's export licence could prevent Canadian
producers from participating in the burgeoning U.S. co-generation market because
financing for co-generation plants is based on long-term gas supply at a fixed
price.

Sceptre has yet to apply for regulatory approval, but one company executive
noted that the ERCB's judgment against Pan-Alberta is a concern.

Scotty Cameron, president of Pan-Alberta, said the company was aware of the ERCB
15-year ceiling but assumed, in light of stated provincial policy regarding
energy and free trade, that the removal permit would be approved.

Addressing an oil and gas conference in Toronto last week, Neil Webber,
Alberta's energy minister, said, ''Governments should adjust their regime to
help industries develop resources, to help maintain the capacity of the
industry.''

According to Cameron, there is a lag between Alberta's policy and its practice
regarding energy exports.

The ERCB decision has a profound impact on the proposed construction of new
pipelines in the U.S. The economics for pipelines built to accommodate Canadian
gas are worked out over 20 years or more.

Pan-Alberta is hopeful that it can sway the ERCB's decision but if it can not,
it will fulfill the contract by removing gas from British Columbia, Saskatchewan
and the Northwest Territories.

ERRORS PLAGUED RESPONSE: RESIDENT

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 410 words


The woman who reported a sour gas leak near Chestermere said the emergency
response to her call was a comedy of errors and two agencies in-volved disagree
on what happened.

Vicky Williams, who lives with within 2.5 kilometres of two oil wells considered
possible sources of the odor that led to the evacuation of some Chestermere
residents Saturday, said it's lucky the problem wasn't serious.

Williams said she was upset over the response to her complaint to the Calgary
fire department's non-emergency number because:

* The fire department couldn't locate the wells. Her husband showed them.

* Neighbors were put on evacuation alert but she wasn't, even though she lives
on the same 20-acre parcel.

* When she called Sunday to find out what happened, she was told to call Monday
during regular hours.

* When Williams called the emergency line of a company that had owned one well,
nobody responded. To find other numbers she had to go to the well site.

"If there had been a hydrogen sulphide leak, we'd have all been gone," she said
of the response plans.

Capt. Pete Pendlebury, of the fire department's hazardous materials team,
insisted the Energy Resources Conservation Board the provincial oilfield
watchdog that could have located the wells and identified the seriousness of the
situation was called in an appropriate and timely fashion.

"I can't tell you why they didn't get out there earlier," Pendlebury said.

But Stew Slymon, Calgary south supervisor for the ERCB, disputes that claim,
saying his organization heard about the problem through the media. He said it
wasn't officially notified until about 10 p.m. 11/2 hours after Williams called
the fire department.

The ERCB should be contacted immediately, he said, adding, "I guarantee we'll be
getting together with them to further discuss procedures and protocol. It's not
an issue we take lightly."

Noting the wells contain a small amount of gas that wouldn't be dangerous unless
a leak occurred when "you were sitting on top of the stack and breathing the
fumes," Slymon said the response would have been less dramatic if his
organization was called earlier.

Williams said she didn't want to point fingers: "I'd really like to believe we
have a great opportunity out of this exercise to look at what we're doing and
make it happen better."

The problem has been ruled a non-threatening odor complaint. The source of the
odor hasn't been identified.

Wisconsin: New master's program in energy conservation is first of its kind

LENGTH: 429  words

DATELINE: Madison


University of Wisconsin, The State of Wisconsin has issued the following news
release:

A new professional master's program will launch at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in fall 2015 and become the first in the world specifically
designed to train analytically minded students to evaluate energy efficiency and
other resource conservation initiatives.

The Resource and Energy Demand Analysis (REDA) program is an accelerated degree
designed to meet the growing need for professionals in consulting, utilities,
organizations promoting renewables, and other areas of resource conservation.

Bill Provencher, a professor of agricultural and applied economics and energy
consultant who will serve as the REDA director, says he has seen a skills gap in
the industry firsthand. "So many college graduates care deeply about the
environment and issues like climate change," he says. "This degree will help
them satisfy their desire to work toward a low-carbon future while also earning
a good living."

Madison is one of only a few cities nationwide with a cluster of resource and
energy consulting firms, allowing REDA to draw on the expertise of local
professionals to enhance student learning and advise on curriculum.

"We've added value to the curriculum by including a practicum that simulates a
workplace experience using real data," says Barbara Forrest, a REDA co-designer.
"At the end, students will have a tangible credential to show employers, and
students can complete the degree in only 10 months -- it's accelerated so they
can get out into a job as quickly as possible. This would be a great track for
environmental studies majors who enjoy quantitative work."The need for
specialized training in demand analysis is being driven by explosive growth in
advanced technologies, such as smart meters and smart thermostats, says
Provencher. These devices are creating new opportunities for conservation by
collecting data that can be analyzed to understand behavioral factors in
programs to reduce energy demand.

Provencher and Forrest say the job market for REDA graduates will also be
international, thanks to the global push toward using smart technologies, such
as water and electricity meters, to encourage conservation. "Utilities
everywhere are trying to get their customers to save, and all those management
programs need careful evaluation to see what works," Forrest says. "REDA
graduates will be those analysts."

Farmers looking toward the sun: Hoping solar energy helps save money, improve
production.

BYLINE: Matt Hildner, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 542 words


Aug. 25--MOSCA -- A group of farmers in the San Luis Valley are hoping the
vacant field corners that surround their irrigation circles will provide good
homes for solar panels.

The six are part of a pilot project that uses solar power to partially power
their irrigation systems and includes federal tax credits, a $75,000 grant from
the Natural Resources Conservation Service and a $45,000 rebate per farmer from
Xcel Energy.

More than 50 people gathered at the farm of Ernie and Paul New near Mosca Friday
to see the switch thrown on the $90,000 system that sits in one of their field
corners.

"We've been doing organic farming for a long time and we know that alternative,
renewable energies is something that everyone is going to be looking at," Ernie
New said.

New's son, Paul, manages the farm that grows mostly organic potatoes and a type
of grain called quinoa. He said their energy bills run anywhere from $7,000 to
$10,000 per year.

"If this will shave $2,500 off, that's pretty good," he said.

But an idea of exactly how much the project members can cut from their energy
costs won't come until they've done their taxes.

Craig Miner, another project participant, has panels at his farm in Rio Grande
County where he grows potatoes and barley.

He would like a program that expands the power capacity up to 25 kilowatts to 30
kilowatts, roughly enough to power an entire pivot circle.

Miner's solar panels now generate roughly a third of the power he needs to run
his sprinkler.

"I think if they can get this thing to where each circle can stand on its own,
you'll really see some participation," he said.

Such an expansion may not happen next year, depending on how the state office of
the Natural Resources Conservation Service divvies up the program money.

The office may have to decide between at least 30 other projects, said Roger
Doane, a member of the Research, Conservation and Development Council in the
local field office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Congressman John Salazar, D-Colo., said Congress will continue to put money into
renewable energy. He cited the 2007 Farm Bill, which passed through the House of
Representatives and would boost spending on renewable energy by $4.5 billion.

"This is only the tip of the iceberg," he said. "I can assure you the priority
of the 110th Congress is alternative renewable energy."

The evolution of solar technology will also reduce the price, said Daniel
Duffield, with New Mexico-based Direct Power and Water. His company built and
installed the solar systems for the project.

"Ten years ago, there were seven world class manufacturers of these modules. Now
there's around 70," he said. "The long-term benefits, the environmental
benefits, the independent nature of the way these produce power are all going to
lead down the road to the adoption and growth of this technology."

Industry veterans to head regulators; New energy chiefs hail from Telus,
government

The Alberta government has appointed two regulatory veterans to the top jobs in
the province's new energy regulatory bodies on Wednesday.

It named Telus Corp. vice-president Willie Grieve as founding chairman of the
Alberta Utilities Commission and Dan McFadyen, deputy minister of energy, as
chairman of the reconstituted Energy Resources Conservation Board.

Both of the appointments are effective Feb. 1, 2008, and follow the government's
decision earlier this year to split regulation of oil and gas, and of
electricity and provincially regulated pipelines, into separate bodies. That
decision prompted the Alberta Utilities Commission Act, or Bill 46, which was
passed with much controversy and the government's use of closure earlier this
month.

Neither Grieve nor McFadyen were available for comment Wednesday. However, in
prepared remarks in a government news release, both said they are looking
forward to their new roles.

Energy Minister Mel Knight said the new energy regulatory regime in the province
has created high expectations among both the public and industry. "Meeting these
high expectations requires effective leadership within the new regulatory bodies
and I am confident we have that in Mr. Grieve and Mr. McFadyen," said Knight.

"Albertans expect their energy regulators to respect and listen to the views of
those affected by energy development before decisions are made," Knight added.
"They also want dependable electricity and utility services and . . . assurances
that the energy resources they own are being developed in a responsible way."

Although the decision to remake the regulatory landscape had already been made,
the existing regulator, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, was thrown into
disarray and its reputation damaged earlier this year after it was revealed the
regulator had spied on landowners opposed to a project it was adjudicating. That
resulted in the departure of a number of staff and, eventually, a number of
board members.

William Tilleman, a Calgary lawyer who was parachuted into the top energy board
job in September by Knight to clean house and oversee its wind-down, will act as
resources conservation board chairman until McFadyen takes over.

"We have paved the way for the ERCB and the AUC to regulate Alberta's energy
resources and utilities in a way that people know is balanced and fair, and for
the ERCB to have a necessary focus on conservation," said Tilleman.

"I know that Willie Grieve and Dan McFadyen are well qualified to lead the two
new boards."

McFadyen brings to the table more than 20 years in the public service and public
policy sphere, much of it connected to energy, with roles in the energy arms of
the governments of Alberta, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan and a senior role with
the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association. Oil and gas industry leaders said
Wednesday that McFadyen is a solid choice for the job.

"We worked with Dan in Saskatchewan when he was assistant deputy minister, Nova
Scotia as deputy (minister) and here as deputy (minister of energy)," said
Pierre Alvarez, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

"Industry has worked with Dan and looks forward to working with him (and) looks
forward to the transition being over."

The move to remake Alberta's energy regulation coincided with the government's
decision to change Alberta's royalty structure and a period of overall high and
rising industry costs juxtaposed with low natural gas prices.

"It's been a long year of the legislation and the changes and the people and all
that," Alvarez said. "From our point of view, it's back to dealing with things
without the overhang of change in the air."

Grieve is a Telus veteran, its vice-president of regulatory affairs for the past
decade and has a long history representing governments and regulators as legal
counsel, including the Public Utilities Review Commission of Saskatchewan, the
Saskatchewan government and the federal government, among others. Much of his
work occurred in the midst of telecom deregulation.

"We think that, coming from a successfully restructured market like
telecommunications, Grieve will probably bring very good insight and value to
his role as chair of the AUC, plus with his regulatory affairs background, he
appreciates matters of due process and how to handle legislation," said
Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta executive director Evan Bahry.

Peter Hunt, vice-president of City of Calgary-owned Enmax Corp., an electricity
generator and retailer that serves a third of Albertans, also had a positive
response to Grieve's appointment.

"It's good to see the government's appointed someone with such wide-ranging
experience across not only different industry sectors, but also widely varied
geographies," said Hunt. "We believe the regulatory system can be improved to
reduce costs, produce improved outcomes for consumers and also help with the
introduction of environmentally better technologies. The breadth and depth of
Mr. Grieve's experience will provide an excellent background. . . and we look
forward to working with him."

Jim Wachowich, an Edmonton lawyer who has represented the Consumers' Coalition
of Alberta in utility hearings and is familiar with Grieve, said the lawyer
brings a good skill set to the fore.

"I have crossed paths with him. This is a guy with a tremendous depth of
experience in telecom regulatory issues," said Wachowich. "This guy has been
through a pretty big regulatory event that few in Canada have."

Court denies Tomahawk appeal; Residents wanted well drilling stopped

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITYPLUS; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 515  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


The Alberta Court of Appeal has denied a bid by Tomahawk residents to try to
stop the drilling of three potentially deadly wells near a community and its
elementary school.

The court denied residents leave to appeal the Energy Resources Conservation
Board's decision to approve the wells last December.

Residents were trying to prevent Highpine Energy from drilling the oil wells
three to six kilometres from an elementary school with 140 children.

Resident Darla Hennig said the wells, expected to contain high concentrations of
deadly hydrogen sulphide, will likely now be drilled this summer.

"We still don't believe these wells are safe," she said. "Highpine still needs
to work with the residents.

I hope in good faith they make decisions that will keep our community safe."

The Energy Resources Conservation Board has ordered the company to provide test
results showing the levels of hydrogen sulphide gas from the well farthest away
before it can drill the other two. It has also ruled that the latter two wells
cannot be drilled while the students are in the school.

Lawyer Keith Wilson, who filed an application to the Court of

Appeal, said residents knew it was a long shot but they put up $30,000 for the
court action because they believe strongly that the wells should not proceed.

"Given the level of risk associated with the sour gas wells and the close
proximity to the school, the parents in the community felt that even though the
chance of success was low, it was still a chance worth taking," he said.

Wilson said the Alberta government has given the ERCB such broad powers to
approve oil and gas projects that there were only very narrow avenues of appeal.

"Our concern was the processes the board used weren't fair and it didn't follow
its own rules and the court said the board doesn't have to follow its own
rules," he said.

The residents complained that the company didn't file its expert reports until
late and the board didn't give them sufficient time to find independent experts
to review and assess the reports.

They argued the company's witnesses had no academic qualifications or formal
training to provide opinion evidence about public safety measures, particularly
emergency response planning and gas dispersion modelling.

The residents stated in their application that the company didn't do any
computer modelling for situations when there was no wind and "such low-wind
conditions are the most dangerous conditions that would allow a lethal hydrogen
sulphide plume to migrate from the wells to the school, hamlet and fire
station."

Wilson said he still holds out hope that the company may yet abandon its efforts
to drill the wells.

"This is creating such disruption and fear and anxiety in the community. Is it
really worth drilling these three wells?" he asked. "I think other companies
would look at a situation like this and say it is just not worth it."

The wells are expected to contain 16 per cent hydrogen sulphide, a
rotten-egg-smelling gas that is lethal at less than one per cent.

NOT IN MY BACKYARD: Rural foothills residents protest drilling near their homes

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 615 words


Two Calgary companies have run into a new hurdle in their effort to find deep
pools of crude oil in the foothills southwest of Calgary.

Delilah Miller, who lives about 10 kilometres northeast of Longview, is
protesting the location of a proposed fifth exploration well by Stampede Oils
Inc. and Bearcat Exploration Ltd. The site is about 800 metres northwest of her
home on 10 acres in the historic Turner Valley area.

"We don't want to have the smell next to our house," said Miller, who is trying
to get the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board to delay the drilling
licence and move the well about one kilometre north or west.

Miller is also worried a sour gas release could threaten her two school-aged
children. If she can't get it moved, Miller wants to force the companies to
prove the need for their chosen site in a public hearing before the ERCB.

But Jack McLeod, president of both companies, said Tuesday he has done
everything possible, except move the drilling site, to satisfy Miller's
concerns.

"It doesn't matter what we address, she just doesn't want a well there," McLeod
said.

Going to a public hearing would mean a four- to six-month delay and cost the
companies more than $ 100,000, McLeod said. The rig is sitting idle, costing the
companies a daily standby rate.

The well would attempt to find oil in the lower part of the historic Turner
Valley reservoir. Since its discovery in 1914, Turner Valley has produced more
than 140 million barrels of oil.

Miller said 15 other residents have signed a petition to have the rig moved. She
also complained that the two companies have, at other wells in the valley, not
maintained roads.

Rancher Steve Baranek said he doesn't mind oil work, but these companies haven't
kept promises to oil and maintain roads that have been beaten up by field
trucks.

"I'd just like to see them take care of business," said Baranek, who added that
this year his cows have suffered more respiratory illness, including pneumonia
that killed one calf, due to road dust kicked up by passing oil trucks.

Keith Farries, president of Farries Engineering Ltd., a Stampede contractor,
said the companies have oiled the roads near residences and will continue to
apply dust suppression when traffic increases with the startup of drilling.

Another area resident, Mary Morrison, said she objected to the companies
drilling their first well in the summer of 1993, but McLeod has fully addressed
her concerns.

"They certainly went out of their way to deal with me," said Morrison, a Black
Diamond teacher, who added that McLeod has even helped her improve the practices
of other oil companies operating in the valley.

Valerie Vogt, supervisor of well licensing at the ERCB, said the well site has
met the distance requirements, which prevent it from standing any closer than
100 metres from a home or 500 metres from an urban centre or a public facility.

No hearing has been called, but similar disputes that go to a hearing often take
at least two months to conclude, she said.

Field disputes with residents are common and Stew Slymon, a field supervisor for
the ERCB, estimated that 95 per cent are resolved without having to hold a
public hearing.

Stampede and Bearcat have drilled four 12,000-foot wells southwest of Calgary,
finding both sweet crude oil and sour gas. The well near Miller's house is one
of two more planned.

It's high-risk drilling into complicated geology, and investors have recently
shied away from the companies, chopping their stock prices in half during the
past month.

Stampede closed Tuesday at 70 cents, down two cents on the day. Bearcat fell
five cents to $ 1.05.

Tata Power Club Enerji celebrates Children's Day in Mumbai; reinforces the need
for a greener and cleaner tomorrow

LENGTH: 452  words

DATELINE: Mumbai, Maharashtra


Tata Sons Ltd has issued the following news release:

Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation programme, Club Enerji, has been
relentlessly spreading awareness to protect Mother Earth and preserve our
natural resources. In honour of this commitment, the Mini Club of Little Flower
School, Thane, in collaboration with Tata Power's Club Enerji, organised a Waste
Management and cleanliness drive as a part of Children's Day celebrations.

The objective of this initiative was to communicate the significance of waste
management to the students as well as to impart knowledge on resource
conservation. Tata Power's expert team of educators sensitized the students
about the repercussions of waste dumping on the environment and its impact on
the ecosystem through various interesting audio- video presentations. Armed with
banners and posters, more than 2171 students from the 5th to 10th standard
participated in a cleanliness drive in the neighbouring areas, and sensitised
the residents about the benefits of recycling through a skit.

The highlight of the event was a wall painting session where the children drew
beautiful sketches of their view of a green and clean earth, followed by a
signature campaign where the participating students signed their names.

Speaking on the initiative, Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power,
stated, "Tata Power understands that children at a young age need to be taught
about resource conservation for a greener tomorrow. Through Club Enerji, Tata
Power aims to provide a platform to students to share and expand their
understanding and knowledge on the wasteful usage of energy and natural
resources. We are extremely pleased with the enthusiasm displayed by the
children as well as their creativity in communicating their message. We applaud
their zeal, and would like to extend our hearty appreciation to the school for
their unwavered commitment towards this initiative."

In its 7th year of success, Tata Power Club Enerji has recently launched the
Waste Management Module as a part of its Resource Conservation Programme and has
received enthusiastic response from all its members. The Club Enerji movement
has successfully achieved a significant milestone of saving 11.2 million units
of electricity by sensitising more than 7 million people across 11 locations
including Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Lonavala, Maithon,
Belgaum, Jamshedpur and Ranchi since its inception. The units saved by the Club
are equivalent to the amount of energy used to light up 5,266 houses for one
year and save 11,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

EPA Tightens Hazardous Ash Disposal;
Move Follows Supreme Court Ruling on Municipal Waste Plants

Gary Lee, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A5

LENGTH: 507 words


The Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday that municipal solid
waste incinerators that produce hazardous ash must soon start disposing of it
under stringent federal hazardous waste disposal rules rather than simply
dumping it in conventional landfills.

The EPA decision follows an early May Supreme Court ruling that ash from energy
-producing municipal waste plants can be considered hazardous waste if it is
found to contain certain metals or other toxic substances.

Until the court decision, many municipal waste operators considered the ash from
their facilities exempt from classification as hazardous waste. Under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), nonhazardous waste can be dumped
in any landfill, but hazardous waste must be disposed of under a more costly
process in specially regulated dumps.

The court ruling will become effective within the next week or two. Some EPA
officials had advocated delaying implementation of the decision, but EPA
administrator Carol M. Browner opted for immediate action.

"We stand ready to fully comply with the court's decision, and to help states
and municipalities to implement it," Browner said yesterday in a news release.

The EPA announcement applies to approximately 140 municipal incinerators across
the country that produce energy in the incineration process.

EPA is currently drafting rules for operators of those facilities to test
whether their ash is hazardous. Which operators should test and how frequently
they should test have not yet been determined.

The EPA is willing to help operators come into compliance with the resource
conservation law, the agency announced yesterday. An implementation strategy and
a Federal Register notice about the subject will be issued shortly, the
announcement said.

EPA is "willing to engage in discussions with all interested parties about
alternative management schemes ... for ash," the announcement added.

The ruling could require operators to ship hazardous waste over long distances.
For example, municipal waste facility operators in New Hampshire have determined
that their closest options for disposing of hazardous waste are in New York or
Alabama, according to an EPA official.

The Supreme Court case involved a Chicago incinerator that burns garbage,
producing over 100,000 tons of ash annually and otherwise producing energy for
use in the city. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) sued the city, saying that
it violated the resource conservation law by disposing of the ash in landfills
that were not allowed to receive hazardous waste.

"We're pleased that the EPA is enforcing the decision," said EDF attorney Karen
Florini. But the agency should do more to regulate the ash from incinerators
that is not necessarily deemed hazardous, she added.

The ruling will probably lead to increased recycling in some areas, according to
some environmentalists, since some cities will make special efforts to remove
metals, batteries or other potentially hazardous materials from their waste.

Watchdog rumor sparks alarm

Environmental group fears boss at Amoco to be named head of new oilpatch
regulatory agency

A Calgary environmental group has sounded an alarm about the possibility a
long-time Amoco Canada Petroleum Ltd. executive - who also happens to be friends
with Premier Ralph Klein - is about to be named chairman of the Alberta energy
industry's regulator.

The Northern Light Society said Thursday it has learned from a confidential
source that Sherrold Moore will soon be hired to head the Alberta Energy and
Utilities Board - the newly-created body formed by the merger of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board and the Public Utilities Board.

Petroleum industry sources also said Thursday they have heard that Moore is one
of five candidates getting serious consideration for the job, which is expected
to pay in excess of $ 100,000 per year.

The society is concerned Moore's appointment will influence upcoming
deliberations by the board over the controversial licence application by Amoco
to drill natural gas wells in the sensitive Whaleback region of southwest
Alberta.

"The ERCB has never denied a well licence on environmental grounds," said Sean
Harrison, president of the society. "Our immediate concern is that having a
former (executive) of Amoco being named chairman of the board will result in an
immediate decision in favor of Amoco."

Moore, who retired last year as senior vice-president of Amoco but still works
at his same office with the company as consultant, special projects, would not
confirm or deny that he's a candidate for the job.

"I'd just as soon not say, at this point," he said. "There is a process and I
think it's best to leave it with the department to say whatever it is they wish
to say."

Neither Klein nor Energy Minister Pat Black were available to comment Thursday.
A spokesman for Black said cabinet has not approved any appointment for the
position.

Moore is known to be a member of Klein's closer cadre of friends - dubbed the
Kitchen Cabinet - and has received an appointment from the Klein government as
chairman of the Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation. And Amoco was one of
the largest Tory campaign contributors last year, giving a $ 4,400 annual
donation and a $ 20,000 campaign donation.

"He's definitely tight with the Tories," said Liberal energy critic Dan
Dalla-Longa (Calgary West), "but he's not an unqualified candidate, either."

Names that have also surfaced as candidates for the job include: Calista
Barfett, acting chairman of the Public Utilities Board; Frank Mink and Phil
Prince, co-chairmen of the ERCB; Guy Berndtsson and Brian Bietz, board members
of the ERCB.

David Breen, a University of B.C. professor who has written a book about the
regulatory board entitled Alberta's Petroleum Industry and the Conservation
Board, said an appointment from industry would be a break from tradition. In the
past appointments for the board's top job have almost exclusively been bestowed
on individuals who are knowledgeable about - but not directly employed by - the
industry.

ENERGY OVERHAUL ON AGENDA

Minister warns of mergers, collapse

Alberta's Public Utilities Board and Energy Resources Conservation Board could
be merged and other agencies may be collapsed in a substantial reorganization of
the provincial energy department, industry sources say.

In a Calgary speech Wednesday, Provincial Energy Minister Patricia Black said
Alberta's oil and gas industry will not recognize the energy department once
changes under consideration are put into effect.

Black gave few hard details about specific policy changes to be implemented, but
did offer a general framework for action.

"Our ministry will be shaped substantially differently from what it is today,"
Black told reporters following her speech to the Economics Society.

"When you are taking 20 per cent out of government, you are going to see
phenomenal changes all the way through."

The government intends to create "a straightforward regulatory framework," by
"reducing the paper burden . . . eliminating duplication and providing
one-window access," she said.

The end result will simplify and reduce the administrative burden on industry
while minimizing the costs of complying to regulations that remain in place, she
said. When asked if she has identified activities her department will no longer
provide, she said, "you'll have to wait for the specifics but of course I have."

While Black avoided specifics, informed industry sources say government talk
about streamlining the regulatory process means merging the PUB with the ERCB
into one body or "one-window access."

Merging the two bodies is something that has been considered in the past.

The influential Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers supports the merger
to gain efficiency.

The PUB regulates gas and electrical utilities in Alberta.

The ERCB, meanwhile, regulates oil and gas exploration and production in the
province.

"We certainly support the merger of the two boards," said Ann Beatty, a
spokesperson for CAPP, which represents Alberta oil and gas production
companies.

"It would be an improved efficiency measure to have everything handled by one
board."

Industry sources also said the government will look at five other boards,
agencies and commissions in the department to find greater efficiencies.

They said the roles of the Alberta Oil Sands Equity Agency, the Alberta
Petroleum Marketing Commission and Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research
Authority (AOSTRA) could be absorbed within the department to cut costs and
jobs.

Bill Kaufmann, general manager of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, said the
chamber's energy committee also has recommended the government "relook, revise,
revamp and revisit" regulations that govern the industry.

"When you start looking at exploration and production all the licences and
regulations and hoops to jump through it becomes quite a maze," Kaufmann said.

Alberta's rules on gas exports draw challenge

BYLINE: Canadian Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 367 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  A second major exporter is preparing to challenge the Alberta government's
restrictions on natural gas sales.

Alberta & Southern Gas Co. will join Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. in seeking an end to
tight controls by the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board.

''We're working on an application right now,'' said Don McMorland,
vice-president of Alberta & Southern.

The application will request an Alberta gas removal permit lasting until the
year 2010, well beyond a 15-year limit the provincial board set in a recent
decision that interfered with a California sale by Pan-Alberta.

McMorland made the comment as the National Energy Board opened hearings in
Calgary into his firm's request for a federal permit covering its long-term sale
to its parent, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of San Francisco.

The energy board is expected to approve the request, even though the exporters
faced a grilling by representatives of two top Ontario distribution firms,
Consumers' Gas Co. and Union Gas Ltd.

Those companies want the national board to revive old regulations requiring
reserves to be dedicated or stockpiled in advance, a requirement of the Alberta
board.

But the federal board already demonstrated a stronger commitment to deregulation
than the Alberta board by approving Pan-Alberta's sale.

The national board's policy states that Ottawa will only interfere in exports if
Canadian gas users complain that they are unable to line up contracts as
favorable as deals negotiated with U.S. buyers.

No such complaint has yet surfaced in a major export case.

McMorland said his company expects to participate in a review of Alberta
regulations that the provincial board has promised to carry out over the next
few months.

Meanwhile, the outlook is not yet settled for large-scale, expensive pipeline
expansions.

Stephen Reynolds, president of Pacific Gas Transmission Co., said his firm
expects to apply to U.S. authorities this month for expansion of its route from
Alberta to California.

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. is committed to applying to the National Energy Board
for expansion in the spring, to fill new connections with the northeastern U.S.

Exploration costs help push Amoco to $27M loss

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 220 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Amoco Canada Petroleum Ltd. posted a third-quarter loss of $27 million
yesterday, blaming higher exploration and interest expenses and foreign currency
losses.

The results come at a difficult time for the Calgary-based energy giant. In
September, its application to drill a potentially huge natural gas project in
Alberta's Whaleback area was rejected by provincial regulatory authorities.

Amoco had hoped the project would become one of its main producing properties in
the next 10 years to 12 years. The Energy Resources Conservation Board said the
project contravened the public interest.

The $27-million loss compares with a profit of $92 million for third-quarter
1993, which included a $100-million gain on the sale of non-core oil and gas
properties.

Chairman and president Dave Newman noted that after adjusting for 1993's
$100-million gain on asset sales, Amoco's pretax operating profit improved 20%.
He also said the company has achieved greater operational efficiences as a
result of cost control.

However, Newman added that the positive impact of higher liquids and natural gas
prices was mitigated by lower energy production and increased exploration
spending.

The company reported a nine-month loss of $74 million, a dramatic drop from
profit of $130 million a year earlier.

million citizens across 11 locations

BYLINE: India Blooms News Service

LENGTH: 435  words


Mumbai/ Kolkata, June 14 (IBNS): Tata Power's nationwide resource and energy
conservation movement Club Enerji, has been relentlessly spreading awareness
about resource conservation across the country, through its theme of national
building.

In line with this, the Club Enerji movement has successfully achieved a
significant milestone of saving 17.25 million units of electricity by
sensitising more than 12.8 million citizens across 11 locations in Mumbai,
Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Lonavala, Maithon, Belgaum,
Jamshedpur and Ranchi. This saving is equivalent to saving 17000 tons of CO2,
which is equivalent to the amount of energy. Since its inception in 2007, Club
Enerji has been active in over 500 schools and has created 1337 Mini Clubs all
over India. The club has now created more than 195216 Energy Champions and
241917 Energy Ambassadors among school students. In 2015-16, Club Enerji has
saved over 2.5 million units and sensitised close to 3.5 million citizens In
2015-16, Club Enerji had launched an online module - http://www.clubenerji.com/
and users would simply need to register for a detailed access to it. The
objective of this initiative is to reach out to a larger audience and impact a
larger group of IT skilled children with a vision to transform by adopting a
holistic and robust approach towards conservation. The online module helped Club
Enerji reach audiences in newer countries like Philippines, UAE, US, UK and
South Africa and cities like Chandigarh, Hyderabad and Chennai Speaking on the
initiative, Anil Sardana, CEO Managing Director, Tata Power, said, We are happy
and proud to reach this significant milestone in driving the message of energy
conservation across the country. Tata Power has always been committed to the
cause of saving energy and propagated resource conservation practices since its
inception .I take this opportunity to thank all the students, schools and our

light up lives for the years to come. As part of its initiatives, Club Enerji
also organised activities for the school students like nature trails and visits
to Tata Power Mahseer hatchery in Lonavala to increase awareness on its
conservation projects and also provide practical knowledge about the
environment. Today, Club Enerji has become a holistic movement to save energy
and natural resources. Club Enerji banks on the youth of the nation and has
essentially worked towards curbing energy wastage, there by mitigating emission
of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and climate change.

AFPM Announces Chet M Thompson as New President

LENGTH: 451  words


April 1 -- The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) today
announced that its Board of Directors has named Chet M. Thompson the
association's next president effective May 4, 2015. Mr. Thompson, currently a
partner in the Washington, D.C. office of Crowell and Moring LLP, will succeed
Charles T. Drevna, who is retiring after eight years as AFPM's president.

"The refining and petrochemical industries are important contributors to the
nation's economic outlook and while we face extraordinary regulatory challenges,
Chet Thompson brings more than 20 years of experience in the energy and
environment sector to his new role as president," AFPM Chairman Greg Goff said
in making the announcement. "We are confident in Chet's ability to lead AFPM as
the voice and vision of the refining and petrochemical industries throughout the
coming years."

Mr. Thompson has represented AFPM as external counsel for nine years at Crowell
and Moring, where he is chairman of the Environment & Natural Resources Group,
one of the country's premier environmental practices. His practice includes
counseling, litigation, and regulatory and legislative representation for a wide
array of clients under major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air
Act; the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act, the Resource Conservation Act; and the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, Liability and Recovery Act.

The search for Drevna's successor was headed by former AFPM Chairman David L.
Lamp, president and CEO of Northern Tier Energy GP, LLC. "Our issues are complex
and increasingly political, and we believe there to be no better person than
Chet Thompson to manage AFPM's strategic direction," Lamp said.

Mr. Thompson will help to amplify the importance of the refining and
petrochemical industries and their positive impact on U.S. manufacturing, jobs
growth, energy independence and national security.

Prior to joining Crowell and Moring in 2006, Mr. Thompson served as deputy
general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where he provided
legal advice to the Agency's administrator, general counsel, and program
offices. Before joining EPA in 2004, Mr. Thompson spent 10 years at Collier
Shannon Scott PLLC, where his work focused on the Clean Air Act and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.

From 2008 to 2014, Mr. Thompson was recognized as one of the leading lawyers in
the U.S. by Chambers & Partners, and was awarded a Certificate of Accommodation
by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2006. He holds a B.A. in Political Science
from Boston College and a J.D. from the Catholic University Columbus School of
Law.

ALBERTA SUPPLY OF CRUDE OIL, GAS STILL DECLINING

BYLINE: DONALD CAMPBELL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 477 words


Alberta's conventional crude oil supply continues to decline, shrinking by
another three per cent in 1993, the Energy Resources Conservation Board's annual
reserves study says.

"The last time that we had consecutive years where new reserves replaced oil
production was way back in 1969," Lorne Samson, a reserves specialist for the
ERCB, said Monday.

The report said the province's remaining conventional crude reserves stood at
2,680 million barrels at the end of 1993.

It found that production reached 342 million barrels last year, while additional
discoveries added just 247 million barrels - creating a 95-million-barrel
decline in reserves from 1992 levels.

Exploratory drilling increased in Alberta by 50 per cent last year over 1992,
however, the report said.

"The reserves additions (in 1993) are up substantially over 1992 by close to 45
per cent - that is a significant change," said Bob Feick, a vice-president of
the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers specializing in crude oil and
fiscal policy.

"So there were returns to that higher level of activity."

Meanwhile, the ERCB, which monitors and regulates oil and gas developments for
the Alberta government, found the province's natural gas reserves fell by 3.8
per cent in 1993. But it suggested those findings were not comprehensive,
admitting that some gas wells drilled in the latter part of the year were not
evaluated "due in part to staff time constraints."

From the information at its disposal, the ERCB calculated remaining natural gas
reserves to be 54.5 trillion cubic feet.

The board's report found that exploration, development and reassessment activity
added 2.1 trillion cubic feet, but production for the year was 4.2 trillion
cubic feet - resulting in a depletion of reserves of as much as 2.1 trillion
cubic feet.

However, the board noted that unevaluated information could add as much as 500
billion cubic feet to the reserves, meaning the depletion may have been about
1.6 trillion cubic feet.

"We don't see this as cause for concern," said Paul Mortensen, a natural gas
analyst for the Canadian Energy Research Institute, an energy industry
think-tank in Calgary sponsored by industry and provincial governments.

"What it does is lower the reserves-to-production ratio but it's still above the
U.S. ratio and it appears to be sustainable."

The ERCB report found that unconventional crude oil reserves from sources such
as the tar sands hold another 2,624 million barrels, down 107 million barrels
produced by the Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Suncor Inc. mining projects near Fort
McMurray.

The report also said remaining reserves of sulphur - produced from natural gas
and tar sands crude - declined 4.6 per cent; propane reserves dropped 2.5 per
cent; butanes reserves dropped five per cent; and pentanes plus dropped 5.8 per
cent.

Tata Power Club Enerji Organises an Environment Conservation Rally to Sensitise
the Citizens of Pune

LENGTH: 465  words


New Delhi, Feb. 18 -- Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation
movement, has gained tremendous impetus due to the focus and dedication of
school children to spread awareness about energy and environment conservation
across the country.



Over 150 students from Modern High School, Pune participated in a special rally
to spread the message on environment conservation. The students enthusiastically
prepared posters, banners and placards with paintings depicting various ways to
conserve the environment.

The students then marched on a rally through the residential areas of J.M. road,
Pune shouting various slogans and spreading the message on environment
conservation through their own posters, placards and handouts. They also wore
paper caps and distributed paper bags to sensitise the citizen's en-route.

Speaking on this initiative, , Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power
said, "We are happy that Club Enerji is playing a vital role in aiding young
minds, who have been the core influencers in advocating energy and resource
conservation. The enthusiasm, involvement and dedication of the school students
to spread the message of energy conservation is remarkable and has contributed
towards making this a national movement. We would also like to thank the
teachers and principals of the school in extending their support to this

Pengrowth trims production after crude leak;
Cuts output by about 4 per cent after oil released from fibreglass pipeline
northwest of Edmonton

Pengrowth Energy Corp. cut its production after a weekend leak on one of its
pipelines sent oil flowing into a northern Alberta creek.

Alberta's oil and gas regulator, the Energy Resources Conservation Board, said
Monday it was investigating the release of crude oil into Judy Creek, about 200
kilometres northwest of Edmonton. A Pengrowth spokesman said roughly 500 barrels
of oily liquid spilled from the line, which forms part of the company's
"gathering system" that brings corrosive raw product from wells to the
processing facility.

The accident forced the company to turn off 3,000 barrels in daily
oil-equivalent production, or roughly 4 per cent of its total.

The rupture caused a fire but no injuries. It is the latest in a series of leaks
that have damaged the industry's reputation and renewed concerns about an aging
pipeline system.

But the Pengrowth leak differs in one important respect from major spills in the
past year on decades-old pipes belonging to Enbridge Inc. and Plains All
American Pipeline LP.

The Pengrowth line, an eight-inch pipe, "is not one of the older pipelines,"
company spokesman Wassem Khalil said. "It's maybe five, definitely under 10
years old. It's one of the fibreglass pipelines and that's what we're
investigating why and what happened."

Although neither Pengrowth nor the ERCB had additional details on the system
that burst, the industry has used fibreglass pipelines for roughly two decades,
said Hal Kvisle, former chief executive officer of TransCanada Corp. Unlike
metal pipe, they are resistant to corrosion and typically carry what Mr. Kvisle
called "a very nasty mixture of corrosive stuff" from underground.

That mixture generally includes small quantities of oil and gas mingled with
large quantities of salt water. In the Judy Creek leak, the ERCB said only 5 per
cent of the product was oil.

Mr. Kvisle has no direct knowledge of the Pengrowth leak. But in general with
fibreglass pipelines, "for something to go wrong, it's probably caused by soil
subsidence or some external source that caused the pipe to crack," he said. "It
may have been a pressure shock where it was overpressured. But it was probably
not corrosion, which is the big bugbear."

Corrosion and the safety of older pipelines have become central issues since a
recent series of major spills. In the past year, tens of thousands of barrels of
oil have leaked from decades-old pipes in Michigan, northern Alberta and the
Northwest Territories. Those spills have created environmental damage and
sparked allegations from nearby residents that the spills affected their health.

In the latest Pengrowth spill, however, the ERCB said no people or wildlife were
harmed. Flow through the pipe has been halted, cleanup is under way and
Pengrowth said Monday afternoon the spill "has been contained."

The extent of environmental damage remains unknown, however. Judy Creek flows
into Freeman River, a tributary of the Athabasca River, one of Alberta's most
important waterways - although it's not clear how far oil has moved through that
system.

The ERCB said booms, absorbent materials, vacuum trucks and collection tanks
have been brought to the spill site.

MARKET WILL CHOOSE GAS PIPELINE: Hearings on California route wasteful

BYLINE: John Shiry

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 19, Oil Patch

LENGTH: 668 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


    Last spring, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation
 Board held hearings to compare the two competing projects for delivering gas to
California.

The resulting report, issued a few weeks ago, makes no recommendations about
which project is better. This is after hearings estimated to have cost more than
$1 million. Other than providing a lot of work for lawyers and consultants, the
activities were a waste of time.

Pacific Gas Transmission Co. is building its new pipeline beside its existing
pipeline from Kingsgate in southeastern British Columbia to Malin on the
California border. Altamont Gas Transmission Co. plans a new route from Wild
Horse, Mont., to Opal, Wyo., where it would link up with Kern River Pipeline
Co.'s system running west into southern California.

Three major issues matter to producers: tolls, volumes and netbacks.

On tolls, the ERCB confirmed PGT offers slightly lower shipping rates when
operating at 100% capacity. The two pipelines have each claimed lower tolls.

PGT's tolls may be revised again to equalize rates on the old and the new
pipeline, since both lines will operate as an integrated system. Altamont has
yet to finalize its construction plans so its capital cost - and tolls - remain
undetermined. PGT has a fixed-cost contract with its construction company.

The actual tolls also depend on the volumes of gas shipped and at 50% load
factors, PGT's tolls are slightly higher for the first three years. At 75%, PGT
is more expensive for the first two years, so volumes are important.

On volumes of gas contracted, the ERCB found PGT had firm contracts for half its
capacity of 920 million cubic feet a day, compared with 13% for Altamont's 720
million cf/d. Both companies reported that shippers for about 25% of their
capacity are still without markets.

Altamont claims it offers additional markets for moving gas east on pipelines
from Opal. The ERCB made one of its most specific declarations on this topic:
''It is doubtful that Altamont provides a viable option to serve eastern
markets.'' Other pipelines can move gas over more direct routes at lower costs.

This is an important criticism of the Altamont project which confirms the
widespread feeling that Altamont's route into the gas-producing region centred
on Opal will produce lower netbacks for producers.

On netbacks - the price the producer receives after paying tolls - the board was
cautious. Nobody knows what will happen to California gas prices. The board
pointed out both systems could affect producer netbacks in California by
providing additional pipeline capacity into a slow-growth market.

Everybody knows there will be overcapacity for the next few years. Nobody has a
clear fix on what will happen to California prices so the netback question is
unanswered.

By the time the ERCB hearings started, PGT had begun laying pipe. The company
has now spent about $900 million on the project. The National Energy Board
recently approved the B.C. portion of the project from Kingsgate to the Alberta
border.

The NEB is now reviewing the first requests for the export permits that will
fill the pipe with gas. Export approvals are not automatic, but the contracts
specify that once PGT completes its pipeline, the producers are responsible for
paying the tolls, even if they cannot ship their gas.

In the meantime, Altamont continues to play catch-up. Its project has a shorter
construction schedule, so it does not have to start work until next spring. To
date, it has spent about $30 million.

The bottom line is that the PGT expansion is well under way and Western gas
producers are responsible for the pipeline's cost. Altamont is still treading
water; most of the people I have talked to still do not believe the project will
go ahead on schedule.

The ERCB shed little light on the competing projects and that is as it should
be. In the world of de-regulated gas markets, buyers and sellers determine which
pipelines are viable.

Whaleback verdict sends shock waves

BYLINE: Laurie Ludwick

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 409 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


The Alberta government's Energy Resources Conservation Board yesterday turned
down Amoco Canada Ltd.'s controversial application to drill a potentially huge
natural gas well in the environmentally sensitive Whaleback area of the Rocky
Mountain foothills.

The precedent-setting decision sent shock waves through the industry, which
expected the Amoco project to get the go-ahead because it would generate $2
billion in revenues and add 2% to Alberta's known reserves of natural gas.

The board said despite the economic importance of the project, the Amoco well
contravened the public interest. It also said the Whaleback region, a pristine
wildnerness habitat 120 kilometres southwest of Calgary,is the largest montane
ecosystem in North America and could be jeopardized by the project.

Amoco yesterday issued a terse statement in which it said it is ''understandably
disappointed.'' Company chairman Dave Newman complained the board based its
decision on ''vague land-use guidelines'' and he argued that Amoco had proposed
''a leading-edge solution'' to environmental protection.

Amoco has spent millions on its case, bringing in expert witnesses from across
North America to answer the concerns of environmentalists and local residents.

Environmental groups in the province described the decision as ''monumental''
because this is the first exploratory well to be rejected on environmental
grounds since the 1930s.

''We certainly didn't expect this,'' said Diane Pachal, conservation director
for the Alberta Wilderness Association. ''What's important is they didn't turn
this down on technical grounds but for environmental reasons.''

Pachal said environmental groups will meet with Amoco next Monday to press the
company not to appeal the decision to the provincial cabinet.

Board co-chairman Phil Prince said there are lessons to be learned from the
decision, because, he said, ''companies generally have a whole wealth of
information'' and should be able to find a way to bring projects in line with
regulations.

Last night, Alberta Energy Minister Pat Black and Environment Minister Brian
Evans met with a senior executive from the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers to discuss the implications of the ruling.

The Alberta government, which had fought to have Amoco's application approved,
had already granted Amoco surface rights, which allowed the company to do
seismic work and build a road.

GREY CUP THEME

When musician Stan Foster heard that the Grey Cup was coming to town, he felt
compelled to write a theme song for the festivities.

"I'm a songwriter, I'm from Calgary, I'm a football fan and I love the
Stampeders. It had to be done by me," reasoned the 38-year-old former pilot.

And that's how Rockin' by the Rockies came to be.

"There was no contest to do a song, so I took the initiative. I just did it
because if somebody else had done it, I'd be kicking myself," said Foster, who
co-wrote the tune with Bobby Rio, a fellow musician.

The cassette just hit the record stores, sport shops and radio stations in the
past week and, should the Stamps qualify for the Grey Cup, the 2,500 copies at $
6.95 apiece could go quickly, Foster said.

Even if they all sell, it's a break-even venture, said Foster, who also wrote
Heroes Of The Game, the theme for the 1987 Grey Cup.

"Heroes was quite successful, so I thought we could re-live the whole experience
this year," said Foster.

Just how excited Calgarians get about the song will probably have a lot to do
with the spirit they're in for Grey Cup, Foster says.

If the Stampeders are in the game, it could be their battle cry.

"I'm crossing my fingers they'll win this weekend."

OIL-FIND HEARING SET

The Energy Resources Conservation Board has scheduled a hearing Jan. 11 into
Husky Oil's plans to develop its oil discovery at Moose Mountain, 15 kilometres
northwest of Bragg Creek.

Rob Cox, the ERCB's assistant manager for drilling, said Friday that a Dec. 3
prehearing will set terms of reference for the hearing.

Environmental groups are concerned about the development's potential impact on
wildlife.

Alberta energy, utilities regulator to be divided

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; BUSINESS TICKER: NORTH AMERICA:;
REGULATION: ENERGY; Pg. B16

LENGTH: 112 words


The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (AEUB), Alberta's energy regulator, is to
be divided into two separate regulatory bodies. Legislation to be introduced
this spring by Alberta Energy Minister Mel Knight will split the regulator into
an Energy Resources Conservation Board, which will oversee oil, natural gas and
coal development, and an Alberta Utilities Commission, responsible for power
deregulation, consumer price protection and the electricity transmission grid.
The AEUB, formed in 1995, has faced an increasingly hectic workload as a result
of Alberta's oil sands growth and its energy deregulation, handling over 60,000
regulatory applications in 2006 alone.

Alberta to revamp bill over landowner fears

BYLINE: Norval Scott

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; Business Ticker: NORTH AMERICA:
REGULATION: OIL & GAS; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 178 words


Alberta is set to amend proposed legislation that overhauls the provincial
energy regulator, changing some elements that have drawn fire from critics who
say the new bill will prevent landowners from being able to intervene in
hearings. The legislation, known as Bill 46, was introduced in June. It will
split the  the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB), into two separate
bodies, the Alberta Utilities Commission, which will regulate natural gas rates
and electricity transmission, and the Energy Resources Conservation Board,
responsible for oil and gas facilities. Critics of Bill 46 charge that the
proposed legislation amends the rights of landowners, allowing regulators to
refuse to allow landowners to intervene in hearings if they can't show that they
would be affected "in a material way."That's a change from previous wording,
sparking fears that locals would be prevented from taking part in regulatory
hearings. According to local media, the language in the bill will be changed
back to appease those concerns, with the amendments expected next week.

HEWLETT-PACKARD Co has launched the Eco Solutions programme, which involves a
selection of solutions and services designed to help customers make
environmentally responsible choices. It is hoping to reach its target of
recycling two billion pounds of IT equipment and print cartridges by next year.
"HP Eco Solutions for Printing can help customers reduce the environmental
impact of printing through energy efficiency, resource conservation, `digitally
green' alternatives, and reuse and recycling," said Ivy Liang, vice president
(marketing), imaging and printing group, HP Asia-Pacific and Japan.

By 2011, HP plans to use 100 million pounds cumulatively of recycled plastic in
printing products, reduce the average weight of printer packaging per product by
35 per cent, use at least 35 per cent of recycled paper in cardboard packaging
for printers, and reduce plastic used in printer packaging by 50 per cent. For
consumers, HP also introduced the Eco Highlights label on over 150 inkjet and
laser products so they can make informed decisions and understand the impact of
the products on carbon footprint, according to Liang. The label indicates if a
product is Energy Star-compliant, how much it saves paper, and if it is able to
drive power efficiency. In terms of resource conservation, HP is promoting
savings on paper, ink and toner. It has developed ink and toner to deliver the
quality required to minimise waste. HP also has developed recycling plants to
make sure that its products do not end up in landfills. The plants are located
in strategic sites such as Singapore and Australia. Noting the bigger impact of
printing by firms, HP has introduced Managed Print Services, a customisable
suite of imaging and printing hardware, software and services to help customers
analyse and optimise their printing environment. Through the Green IT Action
Plan for Printing programme, HP is providing a guide to help customers assess
their imaging and printing infrastructure and get a strategy to reduce its
impact on the environment. The guide is accessible at hp.com/go/greenITplan/.
Consumers also can log on to hp.com/go/carbonfootprint to get the HP Carbon
Footprint Calculator. This online tool is designed to measure the level of power
usage, paper usage, carbon footprint and cost of imaging products from HP and
rivals. "You can immediately see the savings you can achieve by changing your
printing environment," said Serene Ho, market development manager, LaserJet,
imaging and printing group, HP Malaysia.

Alberta agency acts as buffer   between province and industry

BYLINE: ANTHONY McCALLUM; GAM

LENGTH: 673 words


By  ANTHONY McCALLUM
   The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board, responsible for orderly
 development of provincial resources, continues to expand in size, scope
 and authority.

Established in 1938 on the heels of the first oil discoveries in the
 province, the AERCB now has broad authority over all provincial energy
 interests, including coal, electricity, oil sands and heavy oil deposits.

It was created by former Alberta premier William Aberhart's Social
 Credit government, modelled after the Texas Railroad Commission, with a
 mandate to establish production quotas and prevent waste.

The board now employs 670 people. About 100 are located in field
 offices, with the rest based in Calgary.

The board spent $16.25-million in fiscal 1979 (ended March 31, 1980),
 said George Warne, administrative assistant to the board chairman, Vernon
 Millard. Expenditures were up 32 per cent from the previous year.

Although last year's figures have not been determined yet, Mr. Warne
 estimated expenditures would be up by about the same percentage, to about
 $21.45-million.

A substantial portion of the increase results from a recent move to new
 office quarters in a privately owned building and a corresponding increase
 in costs, he said in an interview.

The cost of operating the board is shared equally by the provincial
 Government and the petroleum industry.

The board serves three main functions:
    It acts as a buffer between the provincial Government and the petroleum
 industry;
    It supervises output and allocation of oil and gas;
    It provides a forum for resolving conflicts and grievances between
 companies and individuals through public hearings.

Over the years, the board's responsibilities and authority have been
 increased by the Government.

In 1970, the board was made responsible for hydro-electric resources,
 coal and the administration of provincial pipelines, Mr. Warne said. In
 the late 1970s, it took over responsibility for the use of resources in
 connection with industrial projects.

That gives the board control over development of Alberta's emerging
 petrochemical industry by allowing it not only to review and approve or
 reject the proposed projects but also the type of feedstock that will be
 consumed in the plants.

The board is also occasionally asked by the province to prepare reports
 on particular issues beyond its usual scope, but within its over-all
 mandate, Mr. Warne said.

For example, after the federal Government introduced its National
 Energy Program and budget last October and Alberta responded with a
 planned 15 per cent reduction in crude oil output, the board was asked to
 review the impact of the measures and revise its forecasts of the oil that
 could be produced.

The board provided information on productivity of Crown-owned oil
 pools, which helped determine the level of the cutbacks; but the reduction
 scheme is administered by the provincial Department of Energy and Natural
 Resources, not the AERCB.

Each month, the board distributes directives to the industry that
 detail how much oil can be produced, based on market demand. In addition,
 operators of Crown-owned pools are told what percentage of production must
 be held back in line with the reduction program. Monthly production is
 generally shared among operators of the various pools on a prorated basis,
 a figure determined by subtracting half of the cumulative production from
 the initial reserves of each pool.

Allocation among pools is based on the ratio of each one's prorated
 reserves to the provincial total. Minimum allowances are also set for all
 pools. Certain older pools are unable to provide as much oil as the
 formula permits, so production is allowed at 100 per cent and the
 difference is shared among other operators, Mr. Warne said.

The AERCB's broad powers are outlined in the Energy Resources
 Conservation Act (1975), while other specific acts detail its authority
 over coal, natural gas, oil, hydro and electricity, oil sands and
 pipelines.

All board decisions must be approved by the provincial Cabinet before
 projects may proceed.

When will they learn?

if only we'd let it. Witness this excerpt from an official North West Mounted
Police report penned in 1890 by officer J.H. McIllree:

"The fish have suffered in the past and are still suffering greatly from the
want of proper protection and authorized officials to enforce the laws for such
protection," he wrote.

McIllree, who was based in Calgary, was referring to problems facing "speckled
or mountain trout" -- since labelled native West Slope cutthroats -- and bull
trout.

Among his recommendations was that saw mills should burn their raw wood dust and
other mill refuse, rather than dump it in the river. McIllree told of dead trout
showing up in the Bow River in spring, gills clogged with saw dust.

Calgary fisheries biologist Dave Mayhood is haunted by McIllree's words. Not
much has changed in 104 years.

In the past few years, biologists and conservationists have raised the alarm
over dramatic declines in native bull trout in Western Canada and the
northwestern U.S. Over-fishing and habitat loss have been fingered as the
biggest factors.

But still the Alberta government permits extensive resource exploitation in
watersheds in which bull trout should be thriving but, instead, are dying.

"It just infuriates me to see how much they don't control," says Mayhood,
47-year-old president of Freshwater Research Ltd., a small consulting company.

Mayhood points to Husky Oil's $ 25 million project to drill test wells on a
potentially large oil find on Moose Mountain in Kananaskis Country. With the
blessing of the provincial Energy Resources Conservation Board and various
government branches, Husky is developing a network of roads in a natural area
already butchered by seismic cutlines, trails and clearcuts.

Much of the roadwork is being conducted along Coxhill Creek, which flows into
Jumpingpound Creek, a tributary of the Bow. Both the Bow and Jumpingpound hold
bull trout.

Mayhood fears silt created by the roadwork could be the 1994 figurative
equivalent of McIllree's gill-clogging sawdust. We'll never know for sure.

The ERCB refused to subpoena Alberta Fish and Wildlife biologists to public
meetings about the project in January. Mayhood notes that in states like
Montana, state fish and wildlife biologists regularly speak out at public
hearings, even if their views conflict with their elected bosses.

Mayhood says roads rearrange the entire drainage basin, acting like small dams
which deflect and block water flow. By letting loose sediment once stabilized by
vegetation, "the whole system is unravelled," he notes.

At Moose Mountain, Mayhood says silt from the roads will be washed downstream.
Silt kills trout, especially bull trout.

Trout eggs need silt-free, spaced gravel in which to lodge. Young bull trout
need silt-free, oxygen-rich gravel in which to hide and feed.

Ironically, as the Moose Mountain Ecological Horror Show continues, Calgary is
preparing for the first-ever international conference aimed at building a
recovery plan for bull trout.

Almost 200 academics, biologists and conservationists are expected to attend the
Friends of the Bull Trout conference Thursday to Saturday at the Marlborough
Inn. It's sponsored by Alberta's year-old Bull Trout Task Force.

Anyone can attend the whole affair for $ 160. A better bet is to lay down $ 5 to
attend only Saturday's sessions, which includes a panel discussion at 1:30 p.m.
featuring Alberta fisheries director Morley Barrett and representatives of
industry and Trout Unlimited Canada.

If a North West Mounted policeman named J.H. McIllree could be there, he'd
probably ask why we couldn't be bothered to listen to history.

Risk posed by Mill Woods pipeline merits further study: If we must live with it,
let's minimize the danger we face

SOURCE: The Edmonton Journal

BYLINE: Ron Chalmers

SECTION: City; The City; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 635 words

Why has the city never followed a recommendation to move the pipeline that
ruptured and burned in 1979, driving 19,000 people from their Mill Woods homes?

Edmonton will never forget that catastrophe.

A backhoe operator broke the Rimbey pipeline which then spilled propane through
the sewers, igniting into a fireball that severely burned Peter Clark and caused
a mass evacuation.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board investigated the accident and made 15
recommendations on matters including education, inspection, control of
excavation and other surface activities, and emergency response.

Thirteen of those recommendations have been implemented.

The board considered whether any or all of the several dozen pipelines under our
city should be moved.

It concluded that "the small measure of reduced risk that might be gained from
moving all the lines into the restricted development areas is ... insufficient
to warrant net expenditure of $26.0 million."

With inflation, that now would be $56.2 million.

The board also noted that "the reduction of risk can be achieved by more
effective actions such as fencing, improved leak-detection capability, and
containment of potential spills."

But some pipelines are riskier than others.

The board noted that "the Rimbey pipeline carries high vapour pressure products
which can be very hazardous when released to the atmosphere."

It recommended that the city consider moving the Rimbey pipeline, and one other
line in the same corridor, to the restricted Development Area.

The cost was estimated at only about $500,000 then, about $1.1 million today.

But the line remains where it was 20 years ago, under the southeast corner of
Mill Woods.

That's one recommendation on which no action was taken.

The other was that development be set back a specified distance from pipelines.

Deborah Morrison, an executive member of the presidents' council of Mill Woods
community leagues, notes that the municipal planning commission stated that
institutions such as schools, hospitals and community centres should be set back
at least 200 metres from pipelines.

She says at least one senior citizens agency, two places of worship and five
schools are within 200 metres of the Rimbey line, and that more institutions
could be built near it as development expands at the eastern edge of Mill Woods.

All parties -- Rimbey Pipeline Co. Ltd., the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board
(which replaced the Energy Resources Conservation Board), and the city's
emergency response department appear committed to minimizing risk -- short of
moving the line.

Moving that pipeline seems beyond anyone's agenda.

An EUB spokesperson says they recommended only that "consideration should be
given by the City of Edmonton" to moving it.

"This was left with the city," he insists.

An Edmonton emergency response department spokesperson says land use is up to
the planning department.

And a planning department spokesperson says "the jurisdiction over where a
pipeline is located falls under the EUB."

Ultimately, all responsibility rests with elected officials.

Coun. Dave Thiele dug up this issue by initiating a detailed inquiry to which
the EUB, city departments and a pipeline operators' association responded
Monday, before the community services committee.

The session ended with the committee merely receiving the administration report
as information. This could mean the councillors are content with the status quo.

Or, facing a complex issue that should not be sensationalized, perhaps Thiele
will gather more information to realistically assess the risk that pipelines
present to current and future developments in Mill Woods.

I hope so.

Devon Energy blowout one of several in recent years

BYLINE: Nathan VanderKlippe

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; BUSINESS TICKER / NORTH AMERICA / ENERGY
/ WELL BLOWOUT; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 170 words


The Devon Energy Corp. well failure, which sent bitumen-laced steam spewing into
the air for nearly 36 hours this weekend, is one of a half-dozen oil sands well
blowouts in the past five years, according to Alberta's Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ECRB). The ERCB has launched an investigation into the
accident, which has forced the company to shut down production of 5,000 barrels
a day from its Jackfish oil sands site, about 170 kilometres south of Fort
McMurray. Devon employs what's known as steam-assisted gravity drainage, or
SAGD, at Jackfish, a process that uses high-pressure, high-temperature
underground water injections to heat and free the bitumen. ERCB figures show
that blowouts, while not common, are also not completely rare. Of about 1,200
SAGD wells in the province, Alberta has seen six blowouts since 2005. The ERCB
says they have had minimal impact. "Each blowout produced low volumes of oil and
all but one was extinguished with a couple of hours," spokesman Darin Barter
said in an e-mail.

Decision on regulator coming by year's end; Energy minister says she is looking
at mandate and dual roles of AER

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 674 words


Alberta's Energy minister says she will deliver a recommendation on the future
of Alberta's oilpatch regulator to the premier by the end of the year.

Marg McCuaig-Boyd said she is examining whether the Alberta Energy Regulator
(AER) should be split or whether it is capable of performing the dual roles of
developing the province's oil and gas resources and enforcing environmental
standards.

"We're sure looking into it," McCuaig-Boyd told reporters last week. "Is the
mandate still the current one or do we have to look at changing it? Once we get
that work done, I'll certainly report back to you, but yeah, we're working on
it."

She said she has had regular meetings with the head regulator and met recently
with the agency's board chairman.

Premier Rachel Notley told the Herald in an interview last June she thought the
agency that replaced the Energy Resources Conservation Board three years ago may
need a major overhaul.

"One of the concerns that I have always had with the Alberta Energy Regulator is
that it appears to have a conflicting mandate, in that it is both a promoter of
energy and the primary vehicle of environmental protection in Alberta," Notley
said in the June interview.

"What's troubling about the AER is it has actually taken over responsibility for
most of the environmental protection and monitoring part and standards
development within the energy sector ... You can't do that job when your
overarching mandate is to promote energy development."

Recently the AER ordered Nexen to shut down all of its pipelines after a July
spill near Fort McMurray. The regulator ordered that the company cease operation
of 95 pipelines on its Long Lake oilsands site after determining it had not
provided adequate records of maintenance, inspection and monitoring of the
pipelines.

McCuaig-Boyd said that if the AER appears to be taking a stronger enforcement
stance lately, it's not at her direction.

"They've got all the regulations down and they're getting more comfortable with
where they are going as well," she said.

"I think they're showing that it's working. It's an ongoing process. You always
want to be better, so that's the next phase we're looking at."

AER spokeswoman Tracie Moore noted the AER is being examined as part of the
government's review of all its agencies, boards and commissions.

"As Alberta's provincial energy regulator, the AER implements government
direction and policy through our regulatory requirements,"' she said in an
email. "The review panel asked the AER for materials in support of their review
work, and we provided all materials requested."

Wildrose energy critic Leela Aheer said the single regulator model was requested
by industry after the last royalty review proved to be disastrous.

"Instead of floating the trial balloon of dismantling the regulator in a time of
economic uncertainty, the minister should be focused on stricter timelines and
accelerated approval times," Aheer said in an email.

"Albertans and industry are just getting used to the single regulator and the
government should focus on streamlining it - not starting all over again."

She said Albertans expect the Alberta Energy Regulator to be an efficient and
effective body that supports public safety, environmental management, and the
rights of landowners.

The Progressive Conservatives established the AER in December 2012 to provide
one-stop shopping for regulatory approvals after the energy industry complained
about the delays and red tape.

The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with
responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to
create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act, the Water Act, and
the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act.

Two years ago Notley was critical of the PC appointment of former oilpatch
executive Gerry Protti to head the AER, complaining that an oil industry insider
should not head the agency.

Oilman challenges ERCB ruling

BYLINE: Dan Healing, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CALGARY BUSINESS; Pg. E3

LENGTH: 444  words


A Calgary oilman sanctioned by the Alberta oil and gas regulator after being
accused of ignoring its rulings more than a decade ago says he will fight the
decision.

In an e-mail message Wednesday, Marc Dame, president and chief executive of
GoldNev Resources Inc., said he has "strong grounds" for an appeal of the order
from the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board.

"We are appealing the decision and will be taking action against the ERCB in
response to this ruling against us," he wrote.

"It is undeserved, the ERCB board members of the panel have chosen to ignore
legal and documentary evidence that we submit-ted which will gives us strong
grounds for an appeal."

The order could prevent him or companies he controls from making applications to
the board and could result in the ERCB suspending operations being performed by
companies he controls, the board said in a news release Tuesday.

"Mr. Dame can seek a review of the decision under Section 39 or 40 of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board Act or he can apply to the Court of Appeal for
leave to appeal the decision," said an ERCB spokesman, Darin Barter, on
Wednesday.

"If he is granted leave to appeal, he would argue his position in the Court of
Appeal."

Dame said the order does not affect his role with TSX Venture Exchange-traded
GoldNev because it "does not operate any oil and gas assets in Alberta so this
ruling will not have an impact on my or the company's ability to manage its
ongoing properties or projects."

However, the company's website lists four projects, two of which are in Alberta.

The declarations against Dame and Murray F. Craig come into force immediately
and remain against Dame until 2020 and against Craig until 2017, the ERCB said.

The charges against the two originate from as early as 1995 when Legacy
Petroleum Ltd., a company controlled by Dame and Craig, failed to comply with 85
well abandonment orders issued by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, before
going into bankruptcy on Jan. 19, 1999.

Some of the abandonment orders were issued because Legacy's mineral rights
agreements with the province had been cancelled due to nonpayment of rent.

Dame was also named as a person in direct control of Matrix Resources Ltd., a
company trying to acquire some of the Legacy assets, when it contravened ERCB
requirements and failed to comply with board orders.

Both men contested the declarations and a hearing was held last January,
followed by written submissions.

The ERCB noted that at the time of the hearing, Dame was involved in four oil
and gas companies, one of which held an ERCB licence.

Craig testified he had retired from the industry.

Who's Watching the Watchers?

STATES SUCH as South Carolina, Ohio and Washington -- homes of the major plants
producing bomb-grade material -- are trying to force the Department of Energy to
comply with various environmental laws.

But DOE has long argued that the Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and 1954, which
confer sweeping powers of self-regulation, take precedence over environmental
statutes such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Superfund
laws.

Over the past several years, Congress has enacted legislation specifically
requiring DOE to meet standards set by these laws. But although the agency has
agreed to comply in some instances, the Reagan administration has thrown many
obstacles in the way of enforcement, including policies that prevent the
Environmental Protection Agency from suing DOE.

Yet evidence has been accumulating for years that radioactive waste from weapons
manufacture is polluting water and soil at rates far in excess of DOE's initial
estimates.

Radioactivity has migrated through soil much more quickly than predicted, partly
because organic solvents speed its movement. Experts at the Savannah River plant
in South Carolina (run by Du Pont for DOE) had predicted that plutonium dumped
in pits would take on the order of 1 million years to reach the water table. But
plutonium at levels higher than those EPA allows was detected in on-site ground
water in fewer than two decades.

A 1986 report by the General Accounting Office found that eight out of nine DOE
weapons sites surveyed have "ground water contaminated with radioactive and/or
hazardous substances to high levels" and that six "have soil contamination in
unexpected areas, including offsite locations." An internal Du Pont study
concedes that contamination "may extend well beyond the period which land
control can be anticipated and indeed may exist for centuries or milennia."

The Atomic Energy Commission (which had oversight of weapons-material
manufacture until 1974) called for an end to soil disposal in 1971, and set 1976
as the deadline. But the agency later reversed itself and dumping continues
today.

DOE, the AEC's successor, has agreed in principle to meet new guidelines set by
the EPA under the federal Resources Conservation and Recovery Act. In practice,
however, the Reagan administration has in some cases prohibited EPA from
ordering the agency to comply, and has refused to allow DOE to pay civil fines
to states. Thus, with little outside oversight, it's difficult to determine
whether the agency is improving its record.

Meanwhile, states are afraid that if nuclear-weapons production is cut back --
and program funds diminish -- then they may be left to clean up the wastes by
themselves.

Pipeline leak largest in 36 years

BYLINE: NATHAN VANDERKLIPPE

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ALBERTA; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 284 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


A major pipeline oil leak is the largest in Alberta since 1975, the province's
energy regulator says.

About 28,000 barrels poured out of the Plains Midstream Canada Rainbow pipeline
100 kilometres northeast of Peace River, the Energy Resources Conservation Board
(ERCB) said Tuesday, four days after the leak occurred. The spill raises new
questions about the health of Alberta's aging pipeline system.

The spill represents 40 per cent more than the 20,000 barrels that leaked from
an Enbridge Inc. pipe last summer, in a spill that fouled a Michigan river and
cost that company hundreds of millions to clean up. It's bigger than the 19,000
barrels that spilled from a BP Canada line in 1993, but smaller than a
41,000-barrel leak in 1975, on a Bow River Pipeline Ltd. facility.

"It's certainly a very significant leak," said Davis Sheremata, a spokesman with
the ERCB.

It's the second major spill from the Rainbow line, whose owner is a subsidiary
of publicly traded Plains All American Pipeline. In late 2006, 7,500 barrels
leaked from the pipe, which travels 770 km from Zama, Alta. to Edmonton. An
investigation determined that "stress corrosion cracking, fatigue cracking and
external coating failure caused the release."

These issues are often related to age; the Rainbow line was built in 1966. It is
designed to carry 220,000 barrels per day; last year, it averaged 187,000
barrels per day. After the previous leak, operators of the pipeline were ordered
to lower the system's pressure, increase ground surveillance and conduct
internal line inspections.

The Plains spill comes within a week of a leak on a gas line near Fox Creek that
killed a maintenance worker who inhaled deadly sour gas.

 COMMENTS OF THE GREEN POWER INSTITUTE ON THE

 RULING SEEKING COMMENT ON THE SEPTEMBER 29 WORKSHOP

 Pursuant to the October 19, 2016, Assigned Commissioner 's Ruling Entering
Workshop Report into the Record and Seeking Comment, in Proceeding R-13-12-011,
the Order Instituting Rulemaking into Policies to Promote a Partnership
Framework between Energy Investor Owned Utilities and the Water Sector to
Promote Water-Energy Nexus Programs, the Green Power Institute (GPI), the
renewable energy program of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development,
Environment, and Security, provides these Comments of the Green Power Institute
on the Ruling Seeking Comment on the September 29 Workshop. In these Comments,
GPI discusses issues relating to the September 29, 2016, Water-Energy
-Telecommunications Nexus workshop (Attachment A to the Oct. 19, Ruling).

 The September 29 workshop was focused on emergency response and recovery from
recent forest fires, with communications in the face of loss of key
infrastructure the major topic. Our Comments on this workshop are brief, and
will focus on the remarks of the final speaker, Supervisor Cliff Edson of
Calaveras County, who also presented at the September 9, 2016, workshop that was
the subject of Comments filed last Friday, October 21. During the September 29
workshop Supervisor Edson spoke mostly about communications challenges during
the Butte Fire, but he also talked about the value of performing
forest-management operations in reducing the risks and extent of wildfires.

 We will not repeat our discussion about the multiple benefits of enlightened
land-use management for forested watersheds here, which is in our October 21,
Comments. Properly managed watersheds maximize water production and retention,
control erosion and flooding, and provide improved habitat for fish and
wildlife. Watershed-management operations produce large quantities of biomass
residuals, especially in areas affected by California's tree-mortality crisis,
and these residuals can be used to generate reliable, schedulable, baseload
renewable electricity. Biomass power generators do not require

 GPI Comments on Ruling Seeking Comments, in R.13-12-011, page 2

 system integration, or exacerbate the extremities of the duck curve. Reducing
the risks of wildfire initiation and severity provides major public health and
greenhouse-gas benefits for the community.

 In addition to extoling the virtues of forest management for California's rural
counties, Supervisor Edson also described, at the September 29, Workshop, the
costs, environmental consequences, and difficulties of cleanup and recovery
after wildfires like the Butte Fire. Prior management operations limit the
damage in the event of fire, and make subsequent cleanup and recovery much
easier.

 The October 19, Ruling, on pages 8-9, asks a series of questions following the
September 29, Workshop. The final question asks:

 Should the Commission order electric, gas, or water utilities to enter into
pilot projects or partnerships to improve watershed management, reduce fire
risks to utility resource and infrastructure, and increase water availability
for energy and water use?

 This question mirrors a question asked in the October 5, Ruling (pg. 16),
regarding whether the Commission should require utilities to file Applications
for watershed-management pilots. At the September 9, Workshop, Supervisor Edson
described a pilot project that Calaveras county is pursuing to promote healthy
forests and watersheds. He pointed out that ultimately it is up to land owners
and managers to determine whether tracts of watershed land under their control
will receive treatment operations. In some cases key watershed lands are owned
or managed by electric or water utilities, while in other cases the lands are
owned publicly (federal or state) or privately. In any case watershed-management
operations are expensive, and lack of sufficient funds is usually the reason
that land managers fail to conduct the management operations they know are
needed on the lands they are responsible for.

 The Calaveras pilot project recognizes the central role of the landowner in
watershed management, and the fact that lack of funds is the greatest impediment
to enlightened land management. The legal mechanism that the Calaveras pilot
proposes to employ is the creation of a Resource Conservation District, covering
the entire county. The district will

 GPI Comments on Ruling Seeking Comments, in R.13-12-011, page 3

 raise funds, provide advice and assistance to landowners and managers, and will
act as the focal point for watershed-management projects and proposals within
the bounds of the Resource Conservation District.

 As we argued in our October 21, Comments, without a funding source a pilot is
not going to be able to accomplish very much in terms of watershed management.
The formation of a Resource Conservation District is one possible mechanism to
provide a funding source for land-management operations. Other models are also
possible. Unless a funding mechanism is identified and included, the GPI is not
sure about what could be accomplished by ordering the water and energy utilities
to pursue watershed-management pilot projects. The Commission should certainly
encourage the utilities to advocate for, and cooperate with the creation of
Resource Conservation Districts or other mechanisms if they are thoughtfully
proposed by appropriate parties.

 As we stated in our October 21, Comments, the GPI believes that the energy
focus of watershed-management operations in this proceeding should be expanded
to include greater consideration of the residuals that are produced in the
course of performing watershed-management operations, and the carbon-cycle
implications of various land-management options for watershed lands.
Land-management operations are expensive, and the use of residuals as biomass
fuels can help to underwrite the cost. The use of these kinds of residuals for
energy production has a positive effect on the carbon balance by reducing the
risk and extent of wildfire damage.

Board's move saves Alberta area from development

In a rare move, Alberta's energy industry regulator has cited environmental
reasons for rejecting a gas well proposal in a southwest Alberta area that is a
"prime candidate" for protection.

Overjoyed environmentalists popped the cork on champagne Thursday to toast the
Energy Resources Conservation Board's decision to save the Whaleback from
development.

The Whaleback is an area of grasslands and forests about 120 kilometres south of
Calgary.

In its written decision, the board said it isn't in the public interest to
approve an energy development that might "compromise a scarce or unique"
ecological area.

Amoco Canada Petroleum Company's application was "deficient in key areas and
inconsistent with existing land use policies," it said.

The future of the Whaleback ought to be considered under the province's proposed
Special Places 2000 document, a plan for setting aside protected areas in
Alberta, the board said. It acknowledged the area's importance for wildlife,
recreation and esthetic values.

"I'm overjoyed, I really didn't think we could do it because the whole history
is we never win with the ERCB on environmental issues," said Cliff Wallis,
president of the Alberta Wilderness Association, a member of a coalition
fighting the Amoco gas well.

Since 1975, the ERCB has denied only four well licences for environmental
reasons, one for unacceptable impact on agriculture and three for other reasons.
During that time, it has approved about 4,000 to 5,000 well licences a year.

Hailing it as a precedent-setting decision, lawyer Wendy Francis of the Canadian
Parks and Wilderness Society said, "The ERCB has never turned down this kind of
application before where wildland and wildlife values were at stake."

Whaleback resident Judy Nelson enthused, "Isn't it great! I can't believe it. It
really has given us a lot of faith in the system."

Meanwhile, Amoco chairman Dave Newman said he was disappointed that board
members appear to have "based their decision on vague land use guidelines and
potential land use policies."

Vince Rodych, the company's external affairs manager, added, "It is unfortunate
that Amoco had no advance indication that the board would be unable to
adjudicate this matter until the protected area is resolved."

The company paid the province $ 1.6 million for mineral rights in the
environmentally sensitive Whaleback.

Asked whether Amoco will appeal, Rodych said the company will review the
decision before deciding what action to take. The board did add Thursday it
would review a new Whaleback drilling application by Amoco, subject to
clarification of land use issues.

Environmentalists will meet with Amoco Monday to ask company officials not to
appeal to the courts or to cabinet to overturn the decision.

Premier Ralph Klein said, "I'm satisfied the regulatory process took place and
that a decision was brought down after due diligence and due consideration."

Energy Minister Pat Black said Amoco is welcome to reapply to the ERCB to get
clarification on outstanding issues in the decision, and the government won't
interfere in the process.

Black is not concerned the ruling might send a message to the industry that the
environment is more important than developing Alberta's natural resources.

"Our mandate in the government is to see our natural resources developed in an
economically and environmentally-friendly fashion," Black told Broadcast News.

DRILLING APPLICATION DENIED

1994 WHALEBACK EVENTS

* May 16 -- ERCB starts two-week hearing in Maycroft. Two coalitions of
environmental groups and Maycroft residents hire lawyers for the hearing to
oppose drilling.

* June 10 -- Peigan Indians sign secret deal with Amoco, believed to give
company some drilling rights on their land.

* July 7 -- Native activist Milton Born with a Tooth takes protest over drilling
to Amoco's

international headquarters in Chicago.

* Aug. 8 -- Friends of the Whaleback set up information teepee in Whaleback
area.

* Sept. 9 -- ERCB turns down Amoco application.

THE WHALEBACK

The Whaleback area is a series of valleys and ridges 120 kilometres south of
Calgary, that resemble a gigantic whale spine and ribs from the air. Its 236
square-kilometre area is Canada's largest remaining intact montane ecosystem --
montane is a chinook-swept mixture of grasslands, open forests and exposed
ridges that offer food and shelter to wildlife, including elk, grizzlies, black
bears, deer, hawks, eagles and songbirds.

AMOCO PLAN

Amoco applied in July 1993 to the Energy Resources Conservation Board to drill
an exploratory well in the area near Highway 22. Amoco officials said the
petroleum industry and the environment could

co-exist in what could become one of Alberta's largest gas pools. It estimated
development of the gas field could mean $ 900 million in provincial royalties
and total provincial revenue of $ 2 billion, when taxes were factored in. Full
development would have included 20 wells drilled from five locations and a gas
processing plant.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OBJECTIONS

Environmentalists said preserving a rare piece of Canada's landscape and crucial
wildlife habitat was more important than drilling another gas well, noting the
ERCB had approved more than 10,000 well licences from January 1993 to March
1994.

Overjoyed environmentalists popped the cork on champagne Thursday to toast the
Energy Resources Conservation Board's decision to save the Whaleback from
development.

The Whaleback is an area of grasslands and forests about 120 kilometres south of
Calgary.

In its written decision, the board said it isn't in the public interest to
approve an energy development that might "compromise a scarce or unique"
ecological area.

Amoco Canada Petroleum Company's application was "deficient in key areas and
inconsistent with existing land use policies," it said.

The future of the Whaleback ought to be considered under the province's proposed
Special Places 2000 document, a plan for setting aside protected areas in
Alberta, the board said. It acknowledged the area's importance for wildlife,
recreation and esthetic values.

"I'm overjoyed, I really didn't think we could do it because the whole history
is we never win with the ERCB on environmental issues," said Cliff Wallis,
president of the Alberta Wilderness Association, a member of a coalition
fighting the Amoco gas well.

Since 1975, the ERCB has denied only four well licences for environmental
reasons, one for unacceptable impact on agriculture and three for other reasons.
During that time, it has approved about 4,000 to 5,000 well licences a year.

Hailing it as a precedent-setting decision, lawyer Wendy Francis of the Canadian
Parks and Wilderness Society said, "The ERCB has never turned down this kind of
application before where wildland and wildlife values were at stake."

Whaleback resident Judy Nelson enthused, "Isn't it great! I can't believe it. It
really has given us a lot of faith in the system."

Meanwhile, Amoco chairman Dave Newman said he was disappointed that board
members appear to have "based their decision on vague land use guidelines and
potential land use policies."

Vince Rodych, the company's external affairs manager, added, "It is unfortunate
that Amoco had no advance indication that the board would be unable to
adjudicate this matter until the protected area is resolved."

The company paid the province $ 1.6 million for mineral rights in the
environmentally sensitive Whaleback.

Asked whether Amoco will appeal, Rodych said the company will review the
decision before deciding what action to take. The board did add Thursday it
would review a new Whaleback drilling application by Amoco, subject to
clarification of land use issues.

Environmentalists will meet with Amoco Monday to ask company officials not to
appeal to the courts or to cabinet to overturn the decision.

Premier Ralph Klein said, "I'm satisfied the regulatory process took place and
that a decision was brought down after due diligence and due consideration."

Energy Minister Pat Black said Amoco is welcome to reapply to the ERCB to get
clarification on outstanding issues in the decision, and the government won't
interfere in the process.

Black is not concerned the ruling might send a message to the industry that the
environment is more important than developing Alberta's natural resources.

"Our mandate in the government is to see our natural resources developed in an
economically and environmentally friendly fashion," Black told Broadcast News.

DRILLING APPLICATION DENIED

1994 WHALEBACK EVENTS

* May 16 -- ERCB starts two-week hearing in Maycroft. Two coalitions of
environmental groups and Maycroft residents hire lawyers for the hearing to
oppose drilling.

* June 10 -- Peigan Indians sign secret deal with Amoco, believed to give
company some drilling rights on their land.

* July 7 -- Native activist Milton Born with a Tooth takes protest over drilling
to Amoco's

international headquarters in Chicago.

* Aug. 8 -- Friends of the Whaleback set up information teepee in Whaleback
area.

* Sept. 9 -- ERCB turns down Amoco application.

THE WHALEBACK

The Whaleback area is a series of valleys and ridges 120 kilometres south of
Calgary, that resemble a gigantic whale spine and ribs from the air. Its 236
square-kilometre area is Canada's largest remaining intact montane ecosystem --
montane is a chinook-swept mixture of grasslands, open forests and exposed
ridges that offer food and shelter to wildlife, including elk, grizzlies, black
bears, deer, hawks, eagles and songbirds.

AMOCO PLAN

Amoco applied in July 1993 to the Energy Resources Conservation Board to drill
an exploratory well in the area near Highway 22. Amoco officials said the
petroleum industry and the environment could

co-exist in what could become one of Alberta's largest gas pools. It estimated
development of the gas field could mean $ 900 million in provincial royalties
and total provincial revenue of $ 2 billion, when taxes were factored in. Full
development would have included 20 wells drilled from five locations and a gas
processing plant.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OBJECTIONS

Environmentalists said preserving a rare piece of Canada's landscape and crucial
wildlife habitat was more important than drilling another gas well, noting the
ERCB had approved more than 10,000 well licences from January 1993 to March
1994.

Connecticut Housing Finance Authority recognized by global green USA for
building environmentally friendly affordable housing

LENGTH: 403  words

DATELINE: New York



 Hartford: The Connecticut Housing Finance Authority has issued the following
press release:



  December 07, 2016 - A new report by Global Green USA awards the Connecticut
Housing Finance Authority (CHFA) an "A-" for building strategies included in the
State of Connecticut's Qualified Application Plan, (QAP) and CHFA's Multifamily
Design, Construction and Sustainability Standards and Guidelines that result in
energy-efficient housing that costs less to operate. To receive financing or tax
credits from CHFA, multifamily developments must be designed and built to these
standards.





 "CHFA works with developers to build housing that is energy-efficient,
cost-effective, safe and comfortable. We are pleased to be recognized by Global
Green for investing in quality housing that is built with the well-being of
residents and our environment in mind," said Karl Kilduff, executive director of
CHFA.



 Global Green analyzed affordable housing developments overseen by state
agencies and financed using federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. Grading was
based on four criteria: smart growth, energy-efficiency, resource conservation
and health protection.



 CHFA was among 11 states to receive a top score. The 2016 Global Green Report
shows that the adoption of green building measures continues to grow nationwide.
"In 2016, nearly three-quarters of all state agencies incorporated smart growth
principles and energy efficiency standards into their Qualified Allocation Plans
(QAPs) that determine how tax credits can be allocated for affordable housing
developers, the majority of funding for such projects nationwide. Over half of
the state's QAPs now include resource conservation and health protection
strategies," said Global Green Vice President Walker Wells.



 CHFA's Standards exceed the State's building code requirements for building,
sealing and insulation, and HVAC system efficiency, and meet ENERGY STAR®
requirements for appliances, lighting and controls. Over the last six years,
CHFA has continued to refine and develop its Multifamily Design, Construction
and Sustainability Standards to incorporate elements of nationally recognized
green residential rating systems like ENERGY STAR, LEED (Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design) , and the National Green Building Standard.

ENERGYWISE   Still going strong   after five busy years

BYLINE: JIM SAVAGE; GAM

LENGTH: 548 words


BY  JIM SAVAGE
  ECOLOGY HOUSE in downtown Toronto is celebrating its fifth anniversary.

Opened in October, 1980, the house has become one of Canada's leading
demonstrations of home energy conservation, and has gained national  recognition
for its pioneering efforts in energy and environmental  education.

Planning for the project began almost 10 years ago at a meeting in an
 organizer's home. The plan to renovate, or retrofit, an older home arose
 as a reaction to the oil crisis, and the resulting need to prove that
 Canadians could drastically reduce their waste of energy and other
 resources.

The result? The heating bill of the old house at 12 Madison Ave. was
 reduced by 85 per cent, water wastage was cut dramatically through the
 installation of water-conserving bathroom and kitchen fixtures,
 electricity use was limited through the use of energy-efficient appliances
 and most paper, glass and metal used by staff are recycled.

Almost 100 volunteers have worked on the project - and their efforts
 have borne much fruit. In the last five years, almost 50,000 people have
 walked through the doors of Ecology House, and more than 20,000 have
 contacted us by telephone. Of these, 2,500 have taken our seminars and
 workshops, and 14,000 school children have discovered the principles of
 resource conservation.

Through this column, a film about the house and other features in the
 electronic and print media, people across Canada and the United States
 have learned about the potential for home resource conservation.

But how to gauge the effects of all this? One way to measure the impact
 is by applying a simple but conservative cost/benefit approach: If even
 half of the people who have contacted us directly - 35,000 people - saved
 5 per cent on their fuel bills (or $50 per household) because of our help,
 we are responsible for $1.75-million in savings each year. And if have
 stimulated an expenditure of $50 per household on energy conservation
 products - money spent to obtain the energy savings - we have created
 $1.75-million in economic activity in five years. These figures indicate a
 good payback on a project that has cost private, corporate and government
 supporters less than $500,000.

But numbers don't tell the whole story. Improvements in energy
 efficiency and reduced waste of resources help mitigate acid rain and
 other pollution problems, and help ensure that our children will have the
 same opportunities we've had.

The future holds some changes for the project. The house will update
 its displays as funds allow (one new demonstration in the offing is a
 microcomputer powered by solar electric cells) but most efforts will be
 directed outword, to such issues as energy efficiency in the building and
 renovation industries, and reduction of water consumption in the home.

The Ecology House seminar program will continue too. Upcoming seminars
 include a Nov. 13 session on insulating basements; upcoming workshops will
 cover making insulated window coverings (Nov. 18) and home draftproofing
 (Nov. 20).

Ecology House extends thanks to its supporters and looks forward to the
 next five years.

Jim Savage is co-manager of Ecology House, the Pollution Probe
 Foundation's urban demonstration of conservation. Ecology House is located
 at 12 Madison Ave. in Toronto. Call 967- 0577.

Shortage of scrubbers leaves Three Creeks in a stink; Emissions 40 times higher
than normal

BYLINE: Hanneke Brooymans, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITYPLUS/ALBERTA; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 491  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


Efforts to get emissions under control in the Three Creeks area have hit a snag
-- there aren't enough scrubbers around to outfit all the facilities, according
to the Energy Resources Conservation Board.

A government report released in July showed that chemicals causing odour
problems in an area east of Peace River were up to 40 times higher than normal
background levels. Residents have complained since last winter that the odours
were making them ill.

Scrubbers are now seen as a big part of the solution because they purify waste
gas before it exits a stack into the air.

At a community meeting in July, staff from the Energy Resources Conservation
Board told residents different scrubber systems were being tested in the field.
Board spokesman Darin Barter, in an e-mail last week, said that scrubber testing
is complete and self-treating scrubber units were judged most effective.

"All self-treating scrubbers will be installed in area facilities this fall and
monitored for continued effectiveness."

"When I talked to our field staff, we actually are facing a bit of a delay here
because there have been so many of these scrubber units requested that suppliers
who build these things are running behind, because of the requirements up by
Three Creeks now," he said in a phone interview.

Carmen Langer, a rancher in the area, said last week that they are still getting
"gassed" regularly. Many of the pollutants causing the problem are being
measured, so Langer knows that one of the readings recently was the highest
hourly concentration they've seen yet.

"The numbers are going up, they're not going down," he said. "The problem is not
getting better."

It was so bad that when residents called the local Energy Resources Conservation
Board recently when pollutant concentrations became unbearable, causing nausea,
diarrhea and trouble breathing, board staff told them to call an ambulance, that
there was nothing more they could do, Langer said.

Langer still thinks the main source of the problem is the Shell plant, where
asphalt is produced.

Shell spokeswoman Adrienne Lamb said new equipment to control emissions on
asphalt tanks is still being tested. Alberta Environment is requiring the
company have these controls operational by January 2011.

Shell is also working on two other projects on facilities in the area that will
lower emissions, though they were initiated before odour complaints began, Lamb
said. Both have started, but one has yet to reach a steady running state.

Reid Glenn is a professional engineer who sits on the local focus group set up
to solve the emissions issue.

He said scrubbers could address the emissions, but it would be even better to
install gas recovery systems. These systems grab the natural gas that would
otherwise go out the stack, polluting the air. That gas is then cleaned and
turned into a valuable product, he said.

"Let's do it right and do it clean, and everybody wins."

TWO-STORY `GARBAGE HOUSE' BUILT USING RECYCLED MATERIALS

BYLINE: By Ellen James Martin, The Associated Press

SECTION: HOME AND GARDEN; Pg. 4H

LENGTH: 583 words

DATELINE: BOWIE, MD.


It has been dubbed the "garbage house"-- because old plastic milk jugs

and newspapers were used to build it-- but it looks like a typical upscale

suburban home.

It is the National Association of Home Builders' "resource conservation

home," a 3,600-square-foot model unveiled Dec. 1 to demonstrate energy-

efficient building methods. The goal is to conserve resources by using

recycled materials and saving energy, for example, by using alternative energy
sources to heat the house.

The home, which cost $200,000 to build, will be open to visitors for about a
year before being put up for sale.

"We think of it as a living laboratory," says Kent Colton, chief

executive of the home-builders' trade group, based in Washington.

On the surface, the two-story house looks like any other in an upscale

subdivision-- with a two-car garage, finished basement, four bedrooms, two

bathrooms and two powder rooms.

"There is very little that looks different-- that's the whole idea,"

says Ralph Lee Smith, a spokesman for the National Association of Home

Builders research center, located in Upper Marlboro, Md.

The house was designed to save energy, enhance durability, lower

maintenance and, in some cases, reduce costs.

"This house, dedicated to resource conservation, will have a big

influence on home-building in the 21st century," says Robert Arquilla,

chairman of the National Housing Endowment, the philanthropic arm of the home-
builders' trade group.

Sponsored both by the endowment as well as several trade groups and an

array of manufacturers promoting unusual building products, the model house

should help push some of the products it uses onto the new-home construction

market in the near future, Arquilla says.

Metal studs, rather than the usual wooden studs, are a promising element

of the model home's design, Colton says. The home's metal framing is made

principally from recycled scrap steel, derived from such sources as old cars.
Use of recycled steel in home construction would reduce the dependence of the
home-building industry on wood.

"There's always a question about lumber prices," says Colton, noting

that lumber prices had been especially prone to gyration in the wake of

hurricanes in Florida, Louisiana and Hawaii.

Colton also stressed the potential of the model home's "ground source

heat pump," a high-efficiency heat pump that draws heat from the earth and

can be used in climates throughout the United States. Such a heat pump costs

about $10,000, about 40 percent more than conventional heat pumps when first

installed. Still, the initial investment would be worth it to a longtime user
who would save month after month on electric bills, its promoters point out.

Not all of the products in use in the resource conservation house have the bugs
worked out of them yet, says Liza Bowles, president of the home-builders'
research center.

For instance, wall board composed of recycled waste paper and gypsum is a good
idea, but poses a problem for wall board hangers who face more difficulty
scoring and breaking such drywall than they do the conventional sort, Bowles
says.

Landscape timbers made from recycled materials and used in the model home also
have not been perfected, according to Bowles. The Florida manufacturer

is seeking ways to produce such timbers -- used for decks, railings, columns,
fences and trim-- so they are more uniform in shape and size, she says.

But Bowles says the point of the model-home exercise is to test and

improve products.

"The whole concept," she says, "is to give people feedback."

Study could find new power source

BYLINE: Jennifer Mock, Business Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 200 words


An electricity feasibility study could result in a new source of power in
Oklahoma that's cheaper and cleaner than current supplies.

The Iochem Corp. in Dewey County takes leftover hot salt water -- or brine --
from oil and gas wells and cools it for iodine extraction before the water is
reinjected into the earth.

State Agriculture Secretary Terry Peach said an estimated 30 megawatts of excess
energy is being wasted in cooling ponds each year. The study will try to convert
some of that lost energy to electricity.

"We are expecting somewhere between three and four megawatts of electricity from
the first phase of this project," he said. "The next phase will involve using
eastern red cedar -- an invasive species that is taking over parts of the state
-- as a renewable fuel to boost the overall power capacity to over 20 megawatts
annually."

Tom Lucas, a spokesman with the High Plains Resource Conservation and
Development, said even more electricity could be created if the brine is brought
to the boiling point.

Companies participating in the study are Iochem Corp., Nathaniel Energy of
Denver, Northwestern Electric Power Cooperative in Woodward, and High Plains
Resource Conservation and Development in Buffalo.

Independent power producers in Alberta have had one of their wishes
answered with the announcement of an inquiry into the industry.

Alberta Utilities Minister Al Adair said the Energy Resources
Conservation Board and Public Utilities Board have until the end of 1987
to formulate recommendations on power production by wind generators, small
hydro projects, waste wood and other renewable and waste energy sources.

Mr. Adair wants to know how much energy can be accepted into the
province's power grid from small producers, how their product should be
priced and whether the regulatory approval process can be streamlined for
their proposals.

Orrin Hart, president of the Alberta Small Producers Association,
welcomed the inquiry.

'We've been urging the Government to do this,' he said in an  interview. 'We
want to be able to compete with the utilities."

Industry guidelines focus on community relations

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 19, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 1069 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  Late last week Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board, or the ERCB, and
the Environment ministry jointly published a new set of public participation
guidelines for energy projects in the province.

The document is somewhat unusual because it is a statement by regulators about
standards for community relations outside the regulatory process.

The new guidelines change nothing in terms of Alberta Environment's
responsibility to conduct an environmental impact assessment, or EIA, for major
projects, or in terms of the ERCB's public interventions and hearings.

Rather, they are in the nature of avuncular advice to the oil and gas, pipeline,
coal electric power developers on what works in the increasingly adversarial
atmosphere of resource development.

The accumulated experience of the independent, quasi-judicial ERCB and the
politically driven Environment ministry has been distilled into a roadmap for
navigating through and around escalating controversies.

SIMPLE MESSAGE

Those have been created by the scale-up of Alberta's pulp and paper sector, new
heavy oil and oil sands recovery facilities, natural gas development on the east
slopes of the Rockies, expanded coal mines and coal-fired electric power plants
and the Oldman River irrigation dam in southern Alberta.

The message to industry is very simple: it is in your own best interests to work
out your community-relations problems before they get locked into the regulatory
process with its system of adversarial hearings.

The guidelines boil down to this: the public participation process starts the
minute a project is born in the mind of a company and does not end until a
project is closed down and decommissioned.

Regulation is a last resort and compromise with the community is the much better
alternative for the business, commercial and economic interests.

Since 1971 there has been a steady change in Alberta's cultural and political
values. Wholehearted support for energy development as the engine of provincial
prosperity, and trust in the responsible attitude of energy developers, is gone.

Now every major project, and many minor ones, face intense skepticism about the
risks for the community, the environmental impacts and the economic cost-benefit
balance.

This has triggered unease in the business community, increasingly under fire
from environmental and community interest groups.

Project investment in what has been considered until now a fairly open
entrepreneurial jurisdiction is increasingly vulnerable to political attack.

In response, commercial interests in the province are looking for ways to
address public concerns before activists hijack the regulatory system and create
serious impediments to development that will cost billions and scare off badly
needed external capital.

This summer the Canadian Petroleum Association is putting the finishing touches
to a major public consultation handbook expected to rank with its
internationally acclaimed 1988 environmental code of practice as a practical,
workable management system.

Last week's publication of the ERCB/Alberta Environment nine-page advisory
represents a major change in style for the department.

Prior to the spring election, the abrasive, confrontational Ken Kowolski had
created an image for himself as Minister of the Anti-Environment, with a
''handcuff them and book them'' approach to public consultation.

He has been replaced now by former Calgary mayor Ralph Klein, known as the
''people's mayor.'' Klein practises a soothing politics of communication and is
believable as an advocate of intensive industry-community relations programs as
the antidote for the heavy hand of the regulator.

In contrast, the ERCB has become a worldwide model for energy regulation largely
because of 50 years of success in advocating regulation as a last resort in the
responsible development of resources.

The board has a three-part mandate.

It is responsible for encouraging the commercial development of Alberta's energy
resources for the economic benefit of the province.

It is responsible for protecting public interests when they conflict with
resource development.

And it is responsible for setting geological and engineering standards for
development to ensure that the non-renewable resources are not wasted.

In adjudicating between competitive commercial interests, the board learned
early in its history to proceed by negotiation and consensus, backed by a
politically independent staff of the best academic and field-experienced minds
in the business.

For many years, this created an atmosphere of technical and professional
competence and integrity that earned industry respect for, and public confidence
in, its decisions.

Then, the public mood changed.

Education and affluence created a public constituency for ERCB decisions that
had the sophistication, the resources and the time to get involved in response
to the impacts of projects on personal property and on the environment.


REFINED PUBLIC PROCESS

And the intensity of energy development in the province grew in parallel with an
explosion in population so that first-hand contact with energy projects became
much more routine.

The number of ERCB public hearings doubled in the 1970s and some of those forums
turned into long, complicated and costly debates.

The board had to refine its public process, for example creating
industry-sponsored funding for public interveners.

It has been impressively successful in carving out public compromises in a
number of tough situations.

And it has deftly avoided attempts by competing industry groups to draw it into
decisions that are better left to the market place.

However, it has not always escaped its own regulatory processes unscathed.

The Alberta Wilderness Association has never been convinced of the ERCB's
impartiality. Many AWA members feel the board's mandate to ensure resources are
developed constantly overrides its responsibilities for public and environmental
protection.

And a hard core of opinion in the energy industries still views public input as
an unwarranted nuisance to be fended off with token gestures of recognition.

The new guidelines for managing conflicts over resource development will only
get off the ground if opponents from both ends of that spectrum find them
credible.

Shutdown closes USDA, Connecticut Conservation District offices

Oct. 02--NORWICH -- The local offices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Eastern Connecticut Conservation
District are closed today due to the federal government shutdown.

The USDA's farm service agency, which shares an office on West Town Street with
the NRCS and the conservation district, is directing callers to a USDA website.
When the site is accessed, a message appears stating that the site is not
available "due to the lapse in federal government funding" and that after
funding has been restored the site will not be able to be reactivated
immediately. Visitors are the directed to another site to learn about the USDA's
contingency plans, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/contingency-plans. The NRCS, a
division of the USDA, is also closed.

A message for callers to the conservation district states that the office is
closed due to the shutdown.

Scott Gravatt, executive director of the conservation district, said staff of
the private nonprofit agency worked from home on Tuesday. The agency has a
partnership with the Natural Resources Conservation Service that provides it
with office space, "so when we have a government shutdown, our office is
closed," he said.

Meanwhile, the shutdown has had no effect on the services provided by the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the Millstone Power Station in
Waterford.

Neil Sheehan, spokesman for the NRC, said the agency has contingency funds left
from the last fiscal year to continue its full operations through the next week.
After that, if the shutdown continues, all NRC staff considered non-essential
would be furloughed, paring the total workforce from 3,900 to about 300. Those
300 would include the three resident inspectors assigned to Millstone and
inspectors at the nation's other nuclear power plants, he said.

AMOCO ASKED TO DONATE GAS LEASES

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 372 words


Environment group protests drilling plan

Amoco Canada should donate $ 1.6 million worth of gas leases in the
environmentally sensitive Whaleback back to the province so the area can be
preserved, says a new environment group.

A handful of Calgary members of the Friends of the Whaleback, who made the
demand Tuesday in a news release, also handed out materials in front of Amoco's
Calgary headquarters at 240 4th Ave. S.W. telling people about the significance
of the area 120 kilometres south of the city.

The protesters objecting to Amoco's plans to drill an exploratory well in the
Whaleback were generally pleased by the reaction of passersby.

"People who stopped seemed to know what the Whaleback is, and even people coming
into the doors (of the Amoco building) were taking the information," said group
spokeswoman Cari Patterson.

Roy Haussecker, an employee of Alberta Natural Gas who stopped take to take
information from the group, said, "I know that area and I can't see having a
bunch of exploration there. It's an ecological preserve as far as I'm concerned,
and should remain so."

But Vince Rodych, Amoco's external affairs manager, said the company believes
Amoco's well is in the broad public interest, "and if managed properly, should
be allowed to proceed."

Amoco estimates that if the exploratory well is successful, development of the
gas field mean about $ 900 million in provincial royalties.

Amoco's plans to drill the initial well in the Whaleback, which is prime elk
wintering habitat, are currently the subject of a two-week Energy Resources
Conservation Board hearing in Maycroft. Two coalitions of environmental groups
and Maycroft residents have hired lawyers to oppose the company's plans at the
hearing.

The Whaleback is Canada's largest remaining intact tract montane ecosystem -- a
chinook-swept series of ridges and valleys offering food and shelter to diverse
types of wildlife.

Patterson said her group supports the work of the coalitions, but doesn't have
any faith in the ERCB hearing process.

Amoco has in the past donated gas leases to help establish Grasslands National
Park in Saskatchewan, and the Ann and Sandy Cross Conservation Area southwest of
Calgary.

Energy Department cuts $ 19 million

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E1

LENGTH: 573 words


At least 240 layoffs forecast in war against inefficiency, duplication

Reorganizing the provincial Energy Department is expected to cause at least 280
layoffs and save more than $ 19 million a year.

Energy Minister Patricia Black said specific details of the cost savings and
number of layoffs won't be announced before the Feb. 24 provincial budget, but
she said cuts to energy's $ 95 million budget and 1,396 staff will be more than
20 per cent.

"As we go through this process, we will lose some very good people," Black said
Friday in outlining some details in the department's restructuring, first
announced Thursday in the government's speech from the throne.

"We are declaring a war on inefficiency, overlap, duplication, and red tape. And
we are going to win the war," Black told reporters.

"The old structure discouraged the development of a common vision and strategy
for developing our mineral resources," resulting in conflicting policy
recommendations to her from bureaucrats, she said.

Black said an executive search will begin almost immediately for a new
chairperson of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, which will result from
result a merger of the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Public
Utilities Board.

"We want to move to more of a single-window approach," Black said.

Other changes will see three semi-independent agencies rolled into new divisions
of the Energy Department. The Alberta Oil Sands Research and Technology
Authority and Oil Sands Equity will be folded into a new oil sands and research
division.

The Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, which currently sells the province's
crude oil that is paid as royalties from producers, will be folded into the
Energy Department. Eventually, its operations will be phased out because the
province wants to stop selling its oil and move to collecting oil royalties in
cash as it now does for natural gas.

The minister plans to create a new agency called the Energy Research Council,
made up industry volunteers, to develop practical research and development
objectives with commercial application, rather than pure academic research.

"We still see the province as having an oilsands role," Black said.

Under the new structure, only the Energy and Utilities Board will report
directly to the minister. All other departments will report to Black through the
recently hired deputy minister of energy, David Manning.

Previously, the two regulatory agencies, oilsands equity, AOSTRA and APMC all
reported directly to the minister.

Petroleum and electrical industry officials welcomed the changes.

"This is exactly what the industry's been looking for," said Gerry Protti,
president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

The merger of the ERCB and the PUB is expected to cut overlap in some hearings
and filing requirements from the energy industry.

"One of the things that we kept emphasizing is we want the single-window
approach. I think this is good news," said Don Herring, managing director of the
Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors.

Walter Saponja, senior vice-president of operations at TransAlta Corp., supplier
of power to Calgary and southern Alberta, said the merger is a positive move
that will achieve efficiencies.

One energy authority will also help the public in addressing its concerns on new
oil wells and gas and electrical bills, Protti said.

AGENCY DISPUTING LAW'S JURISDICTION

SECTION: Section A; Page 28, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 520 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14


The Federal Energy Department has agreed to obey the toxic waste disposal law at
its nuclear facilities only on a voluntary basis, although a written opinion by
the Justice Department said that it is subject to the law.

Under an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency signed Feb. 27, the
Energy Department said it would voluntarily comply with the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which regulates the handling and disposal of
hazardous wastes, and allow inspections by the E.P.A.

The Energy Department takes the position that the Atomic Energy Act overrides
other statutes, including the toxic waste law, and that the environmental agency
does not have jurisdiction to enforce the toxics law at the department's nuclear
facilities.

However, a memorandum written Feb. 9 by Theodore B. Olson, Assistant Attorney
General for Legal Counsel, said that a ''sounder view of the law'' would hold
that the Energy Department's facilities are generally subject to the toxic waste
law.

Gore to Challenge Agreement


Representative Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, will challenge the
Administrator of the E.P.A., William D. Ruckelshaus, over the agreement with the
Energy Department at a hearing Thursday.

''The consequences of this are extremely serious,'' Mr. Gore said in a telephone
interview, adding that ''citizens will be denied mandatory protection of the
law'' at the Department of Energy's 45 nuclear sites

A. James Barnes, general counsel of the environmental agency, said that the
agreement with the Energy Department was intended only to allow the agency to
begin enforcing the law at Energy Department facilities. He said it does not
prejudice the agency's legal argument that the department is subject to the
toxic waste law.

Mr. Gore called this ''gobbledygook.'' He said that in a recent case in the
United States District Court for Northern Tennesse the Energy Department had
cited the agreement as a reason to throw out a suit by the State of Tennessee
and others on the ground that the department is not subject to the toxic waste
law.

Mercury Dumped at Oak Ridge


OAK RIDGE, Tenn., March 14 (UPI) - The Justice Department is considering
prosecuting officials who kept secret the dumping of two million pounds of
mercury from an Energy Department nuclear weapon factory, officials said today.

The Inspector General's Office of the Energy Department has turned over a report
on the alleged cover-up to the Justice Department.

The mercury, which is poisonous to many forms of life, was released into the
environment from the Y-12 plant in Oak Ridge from 1950 to 1977. About 475,000
pounds were put into East Fork Poplar Creek, and the state has banned fishing
and swimming there. The Energy Department has promised to clean up the creek.
The dumping was not publicly known until last May.

Charges could be filed against officials of the Department of Energy or against
Union Carbide Corporation, which runs the Y-12 plant for the Goverment.  The
officials said any charges would be for violations of the Atomic Energy Act.

Ad campaign calls for review of pipeline safety; Coalition urges premier to act
after recent series of spills

BYLINE: Karen Kleiss, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 577 words


A coalition of 17 landowner and environmental groups on Monday launched an
advertising campaign to demand an independent review of pipeline safety in
Alberta.

An open letter published in four Alberta newspapers urges Premier Alison Redford
to protect the province's water supply by reviewing the rules governing
pipelines that cross rivers.

The call comes after three pipeline leaks in the past five weeks, including a
break in a Plains Midstream line that poured up to 475,000 litres of light sour
crude into the Red Deer River.

"We've gone the traditional route of lobbying the regulators for years and years
and years, and government, and environment ministers, the whole gauntlet. They
always say, 'Smile, be happy, go away,' " said Don Bester of the Alberta Surface
Rights Group, one of the organizations in the coalition.

"We're asking for an independent review of the regulations and the way we're
handling these 40-or 50-year-old pipelines that are crossing our river systems."

The advertisement will run in three central Alberta newspapers and in VUE
weekly.

It is a response to comments made last earlier this month by Plains Midstream
vice-president Stephen Bark, who said the company was lucky because the pipeline
was wasn't flowing and the river was swollen with rainwater. Otherwise, he said,
the spill could have been worse.

The advertisement begins with the bold headline: "Are you feeling lucky?"

"With over 320,000 km of oil-and gas-related pipelines in this province, how
lucky do you feel? Premier Redford, we shouldn't have to rely on luck," the
advertisement reads.

"You must take action to protect our water and our families from oil spills,
starting with an independent review of pipeline safety in Alberta."

Redford said last week she is "certainly not opposed" to a more thorough study
of pipeline integrity in Alberta, but that she won't consider it until the
Energy Resources Conservation Board has completed its investigation into the
recent spills.

That process typically takes about a year, sometimes longer.

Energy Minister Ken Hughes has previously said the regulations that are
currently in place are sufficient.

"The systems that we have in place today are appropriate," Hughes said last
week.

"The energy industry currently is accountable already for every foot of pipeline
that they have, and they conduct themselves with that accountability under the
regulatory framework that we have in Alberta."

Energy Resources Conservation Board spokesman Bob Curran said Monday that
section 43 of Alberta's Pipeline Regulation currently requires companies to
conduct annual inspections of pipelines that cross over rivers.

Curran said companies recognize the repercussions of spills - both social and
environmental - and that "it's not like companies are actively trying to
sidestep regulation."

He said 90 field inspectors conduct targeted inspections across the province. In
2011, they conducted more than 1,700 inspections and investigations.

Curran said they also ensure companies are conducting the required annual
inspections at river crossings. There are thousands of river crossings in
Alberta, but the precise number is not known.

On June 18, roughly 230,000 litres of heavy crude leaked out of Enbridge's
Athabasca pipeline near Elk Point.

On May 22, roughly 80,000 litres of light sweet crude spilled from a Pace Oil
and Gas pipeline onto the muskeg about 20 kilometres southeast of Rainbow Lake.

INDIANS, HUSKY HAVE PARTNERSHIP

BYLINE: WENDY DUDLEY

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 501 words


The Tsuu T'ina Nation has struck an agreement with Husky Oil over oil drilling
tests on Moose Mountain - one of the band's spiritual sites.

"We're working co-operatively to collect cultural information. It's a
partnership," Dawn Mitchell, Husky's corporate communications manager, said
Thursday.

She would not give further details, but said it is "mutually beneficial to both
Husky and the Tsuu T'ina Nation."

The band, formerly the Sarcee, requested its involvement be kept low profile,
and details not be discussed, she noted.

Elders are helping the oil company identify sacred sites so they can be avoided
if the drilling projects goes commercial, Mitchell said.

Moose Mountain, west of Bragg Creek in Kananaskis Country, is not on the
reserve, but is part of the band's ancestral territory.

"It is a spiritual mountain for the Tsuu T'ina band," Mitchell said.

Chief Roy Whitney was flying over the site Thursday afternoon, and could not be
reached for comment. Band officials would not discuss the issue.

Meanwhile, native activist Fred Fraser - who claims to be a member of the Old
Sarcee band - hiked into the site Thursday to protest drilling on the mountain
where his ancestors once picked medicinal plants. He was accompanied by members
of several environmental groups, while others marched outside Husky's downtown
office, carrying placards reading Husky Oil Eco-Criminal.

"We're bewildered," said Mitchell. "It's a construction site, so it doesn't look
pretty," but only five kilometres of new road are being built.

Husky's application to drill five test wells inside Kananaskis Country was
approved by the Energy Resources Conservation Board last month, and none of the
intervenors - including Fraser and environmental groups - filed an appeal,
Mitchell said.

Rocky Mountain Ecosystem Coalition executive director Mike Sawyer has argued the
ERCB system is biased. It refused the coalition's request to grant a moratorium
on all leasing and development inside K-Country.

"He wants to change the system, and we're caught in the middle," said Mitchell.
An environmental observer is on site, with regular inspections made by Alberta
Fish and Wildlife, ERCB and Alberta Forestry. K-Country officials also are
consulted to ensure there's no impact on recreation, she said.

"This isn't right. This land is ours, and they're destroying it," said Fraser,
who has been refused membership in the Tsuu T'ina Nation.

Fraser is seeking a land claim in the Moose Mountain area for reinstated natives
like himself who have not been allowed to return to their reserves. Fraser was
recently ordered to stay away from the Bow Crow Forest, but a Court of Queen's
Bench judge recently ruled he had treaty rights to hunt and fish on unoccupied
Crown land.

Fraser is also facing charges for blockading a road near West Bragg Creek, in
protest against the plight of homeless natives, and for assaulting a peace
officer when he attempted to retrieve confiscated sacred items.

Shell gets   go-ahead   for refinery

BYLINE: ANTHONY McCALLUM; GAM

LENGTH: 317 words

DATELINE: CALGARY AB


By  ANTHONY McCALLUM
                           Globe and Mail Reporter
     CALGARY  - Shell Canada Ltd. of Toronto has received a go-ahead from
 the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board to build the world's first
 refinery for synthetic crude oil.

If the Alberta Cabinet approves the $609-million project, the plant
 would be built near Edmonton by mid-1984.

Shell Canada spokesman Anthony Stikeman said the project would proceed
 regardless of possible delays in the construction of a third oil sands
 plant by the Alsands consortium. Shell is the major partner in that group
 whose plans for a $5-billion plant are threatened by the lack of
 definitive energy pricing agreements between Alberta and the federal
 Government.
    "We believe there are adequate supplies of feedstock available from
 Suncor (Inc. of Toronto) and Syncrude (Canada Ltd. of Edmonton) to make
 the project viable," Mr. Stikeman said.

The refinery would upgrade synthetic crude oil to gasoline, diesel and
 aviation fuel and a semi-refined light oil.

Husky Oil Operations Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Husky Oil Ltd.
 of Calgary, holds a 40 per cent equity share in the project.

The refinery would also separate natural gas liquids into propane,
 butanes and pentanes. Benzine produced would be used as feedstock in
 Alberta petrochemical plants.

The refined products would be sold in traditional western Canadian
 market areas and should not cause a surplus, the Energy Resources
 Conservation Board said. Existing refineries are operating at capacity and
 increases in demand are expected.
   During the peak construction period in 1983, the project would employ
 about 2,000 people, the company said. Most of the jobs would be filled by
 Albertans, although the company does expect to seek some out-of-province
 labor, particularly in areas of technical expertise.

The refinery would have initial capacity of about 8,000 cubic metres a
 day.

AER report coming by end of the year, minister affirms

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CTIY; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 633 words


Alberta's Energy minister says she will deliver a recommendation on the future
of Alberta's oilpatch regulator to the premier by the end of the year.

Marg McCuaig-Boyd said she is examining whether the Alberta Energy Regulator
(AER) should be split or whether it is capable of performing the dual roles of
developing the province's oil and gas resources and enforcing environmental
standards.

"We're sure looking into it," McCuaig-Boyd told reporters last week.

"Is the mandate still the current one or do we have to look at changing it? Once
we get that work done,

I'll certainly report back to you, but yeah, we're working on it."

She said she has had regulator meetings with the head regulator and met recently
with the agency's board chairman.

Premier Rachel Notley told the Herald in an interview last June she thought the
agency that replaced the Energy Resources Conservation Board three years ago may
need a major overhaul.

"One of the concerns that I have always had with the Alberta Energy Regulator is
that it appears to have a conflicting mandate, in that it is both a promoter of
energy and the primary vehicle of environmental protection in Alberta," Notley
said in the June interview.

"What's troubling about the AER is it has actually taken over responsibility for
most of the environmental protection and monitoring part and standards
development within the energy sector ... You can't do that job when your
overarching mandate is to promote energy development."

Recently the AER ordered Nexen to shut down all of its pipelines after a July
spill near Fort McMurray. The regulator ordered that the company cease operation
of 95 pipelines on its Long Lake oilsands site after determining it had not
provided adequate records of maintenance, inspection and monitoring of the
pipelines.

McCuaig-Boyd said that if the AER appears to be taking a stronger enforcement
stance lately, it's not at her direction.

"They've got all the regulations down and they're getting more comfortable with
where they are going as well," she said.

"I think they're showing that it's working. It's an ongoing process. You always
want to be better, so that's the next phase we're looking at."

AER spokeswoman Tracie Moore noted the AER is being examined as part of the
government's review of all its agencies, boards and commissions.

"As Alberta's provincial energy regulator, the AER implements government
direction and policy through our regulatory requirements,"' she said in an
email. "The review panel asked the AER for materials in support of their review
work, and we provided all materials requested."

Wildrose energy critic Leela Aheer said the single regulator model was requested
by industry after the last royalty review proved to be disastrous.

"Instead of floating the trial balloon of dismantling the regulator in a time of
economic uncertainty, the minister should be focused on stricter timelines and
accelerated approval times," Aheer said in an email.

"Albertans and industry are just getting used to the single regulator and the
government should focus on streamlining it - not starting all over again."

She said Albertans expect the Alberta Energy Regulator to be an efficient and
effective body that supports public safety, environmental management, and the
rights of landowners.

The Progressive Conservatives established the AER in December 2012 to provide
one-stop shopping for regulatory approvals after industry complained about the
delays and red tape.

The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with
responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to
create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act, the Water Act, and
the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia

Our way of life is on trial in oilpatch hearing

BYLINE: David Finch, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CITY & OBSERVER; David Finch; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 574  words


A hearing is going on in High River. Lawyers for an oil company are grilling
people who oppose the development of sour gas wells and a pipeline through part
of Kananaskis Country.

The area south and west of Longview is ranching country, but industry argues
that it has also been used by the oilpatch, lumber operations and recreational
users for decades.

"It is far from untouched by human hands," Petro-Canada's lawyers told the
Energy Resources Conservation Board panel on Nov. 13.

Numerous opponents have lined up to challenge the company's plans for this
natural gas field.

Ranchers have presented their evidence before the panel, arguing that their way
of life is at stake. Rangeland is endangered by this project and others that may
follow in its wake.

Natives are questioning the development, too, given that the pipeline would pass
near some of their homes in the Eden Valley Reserve.

If an evacuation proved necessary -- sour gas is lethal -- the plan to telephone
the natives would fail because many of them do not have phones.

Environmentalists, biologists, botanists and others are criticizing the
company's plan, too, pointing out its shortcomings.

Municipal districts, camping companies, outfitters and guides, conservation
groups and individuals have also lined up at the microphones for a chance to
have their say.

It seems the oilpatch has backed itself into a corner.

But it may not be the oil company that is on trial in High River -- perhaps it's
our society. And our way of life for the last 60 years.

A map of the area shows that much of Kananaskis is off-limits to this kind of
development. And the company can't put its pipeline along the paved highway --
that's too dangerous. And conservation easements on some of the ranch land
preclude oil and gas activity there, too.

According to the Energy Resources Conservation Board, natural gas production in
Alberta is expected to drop by about three per cent per year for the next
decade.

Nigel Hannaford of the Calgary Herald recently wrote: "Petro-Canada isn't doing
anything illegal or unethical, nor is it seeking to bend any regulations in its
favour."

But the fact that this development proposal was forced to go to a hearing proves
that our society is in crisis: most oil and gas projects are routinely approved.
Hearings cost millions of dollars.

Alberta's great wealth -- the provincial government has boasted budget surpluses
for about 50 of the last 60 years -- has come from exploiting of our petroleum
birthright.

The three men who are charged with the responsibility of passing judgment on
this project may be making history. And judging it, too.

Twice as many people live in the province today as in 1980. Drilling activity
has increased greatly to find what remains of the scarce oil and gas reserves,
resulting in more and more conflict between industry and the public.

During this downturn, we may have the time to reflect on our past, and the fact
that we have always been reliant on exports of our natural resources. And that
our development process has always assumed easy access to grazing leases, timber
berths, and oil and gas properties.

And we have never really taken the long view.

Though the current drop in the price of oil seems like a disaster, it pays to
remember that -- adjusted for inflation -- the average price of crude oil over
the last 65 years as been $35 per barrel.

It will take the wisdom of sages to solve this conflict.

David Finch is a Calgary historian.

Drilling hits record pace

Exploration giants already booking rigs through next summer

Oil and natural gas companies are drilling wells in Alberta at a record pace.

If the drilling continues at the current rate, the province's Energy Resources
Conservation Board will issue 9,414 well licences by the end of 1994, seven per
cent higher than the 1985 record of 8,759 licences.

"I'm sure we'll hit a record this year," Dale Tremblay, vice-president of
finance for Precision Drilling Corp. of Calgary, said Wednesday.

Precision, Canada's largest drilling company, has more than 90 per cent of its
80 rigs booked until next spring.

And Tremblay said petroleum companies with big drilling programs, such as
Renaissance Energy Ltd., PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. and Norcen Energy Resources
Ltd., already have summer drilling programs for 1995 that should keep Precision
hopping.

"We'll run 90 to 95 per cent through the winter," he said.

Selby Porter, general manager of Calgary-based Ensign Drilling Inc., said the
oil and gas industry's fundamentals look favorable, with world oil supply only
about five per cent ahead of demand.

But like all Canadian oil producers, Porter said previous boom periods have been
cut short by changes in interest rates, royalties and taxation.

The drilling pace will depend on how successful companies are in finding new
supplies to meet demand, he said.

In the first seven months of the year, the ERCB issued 5,492 new well licences,
17 per cent more than the 4,705 issued during the same 1993 period, says the
Daily Oil Bulletin, which tabulates drilling statistics.

The total number of drilling licences issued in Canada was 7,257 to the end of
July, ahead of the 1985 record year of 7,104, said the Bulletin.

Many factors have converged to heat up drilling, including the growing demand
for natural gas, the billions of investment dollars that have rushed into junior
oil companies in the past two years, and the rebounding world economy pushing up
demand.

Last month, the National Energy Board said Canada will have to drill gas wells
at a feverish pace in the next 15 years just to keep up with Canadian and U.S.
need for the heating fuel.

Hydro-Quebec falls short

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 51, Business Briefs

LENGTH: 119 words


Hydro-Quebec's $2-billion energy-conservation program is doing even more poorly
than utility officials let on during legislative committee hearings in March.
From 1990 to the end of last year, Hydro achieved, at best, 67% of the energy
savings it planned, according to a July 12 memo by vice-president Michel
Grignon, obtained by Parti Quebecois energy critic Guy Chevrette. Conservation
gains could be as low as 42% of the target, said the document. The external
assessment found savings of between 457 million and 727 million kilowatt-hours
in 1993, far short of the target of more than one billion kilowatt-hours. That
target itself revised down from an earlier goal of 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours.

Alberta body says oil reserves up 7%

BYLINE: DJ

LENGTH: 284 words

DATELINE: Edmonton AB


Dow Jones Service
  EDMONTON
   The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board , in its latest oil
outlook for the province, says its conventional crude oil reserves have
increased 7 per cent to 3.335 billion cubic metres since the last outlook
was published in 1985.

The AERCB is a provincial energy regulatory agency.

Its report, Alberta Oil Supply, 1988-2003, also said total reserves for
bitumens that can be extracted by mining operations are 10 billion cubic
metres, matching the estimate of a revised report released later in 1985.

In the latest outlook, the AERCB said another 39 billion cubic metres
of bitumen reserves are amenable to "in situ" recovery - the application
of steam or other agents to increase the viscosity of the bitumen where it
is found, so that extraction can take place.

Based on revised conventional reserve estimates, the board projects
future supplies of crude oil and other hydrocarbons assuming three
different price scenarios. In each case, the AERCB concludes the supply of
conventional crude oil will decline moderately by the mid-1990s.

But, in two case scenarios that see crude oil prices rising from about
$19 (U.S.) a barrel in 1990 to between $39 a barrel and $50 a barrel by
the year 2000, the loss in conventional productivity is expected to be
offset by increases in bitumen and synthetic crude oil production.

In the so-called "low price case," which sees oil prices rising from
about $15 a barrel to about $27 a barrel over the same period, slowdowns
in conventional drilling activity and the development of heavy oil,
bitumen and synthetics will lead to a "significant decline" in over-all
crude oil production.

But the board said it doesn't expect the low price scenario to occur.

Inhofe, Capito respond to EPA's coal ash rule

LENGTH: 380  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Senator James M.Inhofe, U.S Government has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), senior member of the Senate Environment and
Public Works (EPW) Committee, and Sen.-elect Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.)
released the following joint statement today in response to the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) decision to regulate coal ash under subtitle D of the
EPA's Resource Conservation or Recovery Act (RCRA):

"While the rule may not be as bad as some had feared, it will make states and
utility companies vulnerable to new regulatory costs and expensive litigation.
It is nothing more than a continuation of the president's war on fossil fuels
and another attack on America's most abundant, affordable and reliable source of
energy: coal.  By regulating coal ash under subtitle D of EPA's Resource
Conservation or Recovery Act (RCRA), the Administration is subjecting states and
industry to citizen lawsuits. This places wealthy, left-wing environmental
activist groups in the driver's seat of enforcing this federal rule. It will
lead to excessive litigation and increased costs to consumers while putting at
risk the reliability of our electric grid.

"The rule has long been touted as a knee-jerk reaction from the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) Kingston spill in December 2008, but today's new mandate from
EPA would not have prevented the TVA or other high-profile accidents. Instead,
it has a potential to cost our economy $22.8 billion and leave up to 64,700
people without jobs. A federal mandate on coal ash serves as a 'one-size fits
all' approach and would leave a detrimental impact to states that have
responsibly and effectively managed coal ash.  States have been paving the way
on properly disposing and recycling coal ash, and in the new Congress, we will
give states an opportunity to show they are not in need of another big
government intervention.

"We are not pleased with this outcome. We will work to ensure legislatively that
states, municipalities and American consumers have the proper protections from
the president's continued attacks on our nation's abundant and affordable energy
resources."

Assessing energy levels

BYLINE: By Ann Bailey

LENGTH: 517 words



The Pembina Trail Resource Conservation and Development Council and the Energy
and Environmental Research Center this fall will study whether producing biomass
energy is economical enough to be a viable source of electricity.

The Red Lake Falls, Minn.- based council has received a $ 25,000 grant for the
research project, which will be conducted for three months beginning in October
at the EERC in Grand Forks, N.D.

Ten biomass fuels, including sunflower hulls, wood chips and switchgrass will be
tested, says John Schmidt, Pembina Trail Resource Conservation and Development
Council coordinator. Besides determining whether production of the biomass fuels
is economically feasible, the study will look at which are the best energy
sources.

During the summer of 2004, the council held gasification demonstrations at three
northwest Minnesota county fairs.

Representatives of the council pulled one of the EERC's small, portable
gasifiers on a trailer hitched to a pickup truck and traveled to fairs in
Minnesota's Polk, Pennington and Beltrami counties.

Some owners of small sawmills who saw biomass gasification demonstrations say
the gasifiers could turn their mills' waste products into a gas, which could be
converted into electricity to run their mills, Schmidt says.

"It looked like a business could purchase one of these systems, use it to
convert biomass to gas and pay for it in a five-year period," he says.

Locally grown Northwest Minnesota residents will provide the materials for the
biomass testing that will begin at the EERC in October, Schmidt says. Each of
the 10 eight-hour tests will require 2 tons of biomass material.

The council hopes to have a public demonstration of the EERC biomass
gasification testing.

"It's part of the education process as we've now expanded it beyond county
fairs," Schmidt says. "We hope that the next step after this (EERC gasification
testing) is that a couple of sawmill operators are going to actually have a
system that they could use in their business."

The only biomass source used for testing that will not originate in northwest
Minnesota is the switchgrass, which is grown by a farmer in Long Prairie, Minn.,
he says. But the switchgrass could be produced in northwest Minnesota if there
is a market for it, Schmidt says.

"It's a great opportunity."

The potential opportunities aren't only confined to producers of the biomass, he
says. No biomass gasifiers are manufactured in the United States, so "the vision
that I have is not only do we start raising the biomass here," Schmidt says.

"I could see potential for a business to manufacture that in the United States."

Analyzing the EERC testing results likely will take about five months, he says.

Tata Power's Club Enerji organises awareness drive on energy conservation in
Mumbai

LENGTH: 474  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Mumbai, Maharashtra: Tata Sons has issued the following news release:



  Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide movement, has been ceaselessly working
towards spreading the message of being responsible citizens by conservation of
energy resources across the country and instilling civic and moral values, with
a strategic focus on nation building. In line with this commitment, and in
spirit of the recent National Energy Conservation Week, Tata Power's Club Enerji
students from Pawar Public School in Kandivali (West) today organised an
awareness rally in Mumbai to create social awareness around the necessity of
energy conservation.





 The objective of this initiative was to educate the public at large about the
various methods of conserving energy and natural resources, along with
encouraging children to become socially responsible citizens of the country. 165
students aged between 13 to 15 years participated in the awareness rally
propagating slogans on energy conservation, and sensitising close to 2,000
people. Before the event, the students worked together to create posters,
banners, and placards with paintings depicting various ways to conserve
resources. The event concluded with the students and teachers conducting a tree
plantation drive within the school premises by planting 14 trees, thereby,
reinforcing their commitment towards a greener world.



 Speaking on this initiative, Anil Sardana, MD and CEO, Tata Power, said, "Tata
Power's Club Enerji is not just a cause or an initiative, but a revolution that
has played a vital role in aiding young minds. The youth have undoubtedly been
the core influencers in advocating energy and resource conservation. The actions
and contributions of the students have come a long way in making a positive
impact on the environment. We would like to thank the students and management of
Pawar Public School for extending their whole-hearted support and making this
rally such a grand success."



 The Club Enerji initiative has been contributing extensively towards a brighter
and greener tomorrow by undertaking several successful initiatives. The savings
of 14.2MU of electricity is equivalent to saving 14,200 tonne of CO2 and is
enough to light up over 6,943 houses for a year. Tata Power's Club Enerji has
won numerous accolades and has been recognised as a best practice in forums like
Learning Mission by the Tata group. A case study has also been done by IIM
Ahmedabad on the programme. Further, it has also won the gold at the ABCI awards
in the category 'best communication material' and bronze for its resource
conservation module; Asia Pacific Enterprise Leadership Awards (APELA),
Singapore, has conferred 'APELA 2012 - Eco Advocate Award' to Club Enerji.

 Ben,

 Attached is the soils list with the compaction and revegetation potentials for
your project area.

 The way I rated the soils is below. I am not sure if they match the way you do
your ratings. If they

 don't, you will be able to easily change them.

 20160105-4011 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/05/2016

 Compaction Potential:

 Low - good

 Moderate - in between

 High - bad

 Revegetation Potential:

 Low - bad

 Moderate - in between

 High - good

 These characteristics are based on opinion and not a quantifiable number.

 The revegetation potential depends on what you are comparing it to. I am
comparing it to soils

 found in this part of the country. Many of the soils that were rated as low in
your project area are

 rated that way because they have a sandy or loamy sand surface greater than 20
inches and are

 droughty and have a low water holding capacity. However, if you were to compare
these same soils

 to ones in the southwestern United States, the soils in your project area would
have a better

 revegetation potential rating.

 Let me know if you have any questions.

 Sincerely,

FEDERAL REGISTER: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC; Notice of
Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed
Atlantic Sunrise Project Pages 2344 - 2345 [FR DOC # 2017-00073]

LENGTH: 992  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:



 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No.
CP15-138-000] Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC; Notice of
Availability of the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed
Atlantic Sunrise Project The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC or Commission) has prepared a final environmental impact statement (EIS)
for the Atlantic Sunrise Project, proposed by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Company, LLC (Transco) in the above-referenced docket. Transco requests
authorization to expand its existing pipeline system from the Marcellus Shale
production area in northern Pennsylvania to deliver an incremental 1.7 million
dekatherms per day of year-round firm transportation capacity to its existing
southeastern market areas. The final EIS assesses the potential environmental
effects of the construction and operation of the project in accordance with the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The FERC staff
concludes that approval of the project would result in some adverse
environmental impacts; however, most of these impacts would be reduced to
less-than-significant levels with the implementation of Transco's proposed
mitigation and the additional measures recommended in the final EIS.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Natural Resources Conservation Service participated as cooperating agencies in
the preparation of the final EIS. Cooperating agencies have jurisdiction by law
or special expertise with respect to resources potentially affected by the
proposal and participate in the NEPA analysis. Although the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Natural Resources Conservation Service provided input to the
conclusions and recommendations presented in the final EIS, the agencies will
present their own conclusions and recommendations in their respective records of
decision or determinations for the project. The final EIS addresses the
potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of about 199.4
miles of pipeline composed of the following facilities:  185.9 miles of new 30-
and 42-inch-diameter natural gas

 pipeline in Pennsylvania;

      11.0 miles of new 36- and 42-inch-diameter pipeline

 looping in Pennsylvania;

      2.5 miles of 30-inch-diameter replacements in Virginia;

 and

      associated equipment and facilities.

     The project's proposed aboveground facilities include two new

 compressor stations in Pennsylvania; additional compression and related

 modifications to three existing compressor stations in Pennsylvania and

 Maryland; two new meter stations and three new regulator stations in

 Pennsylvania; and minor modifications at existing aboveground

 facilities at various locations in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland,

 North Carolina, and South Carolina to allow for bi-directional flow and

 the installation of supplemental odorization, odor detection, and/or

 odor masking/deodorization equipment.

     The FERC staff mailed copies of the final EIS to federal, state,

 and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials;

 environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes;

 potentially affected landowners and other interested individuals and

 groups; newspapers and libraries in the project area; and parties to

 this proceeding. Paper copy versions of this EIS were mailed to those

 specifically requesting them; all others received a CD version. In

 addition, the final EIS is available for public viewing on the FERC's

 Web site (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrary link. A limited number of

 copies are available for distribution and public inspection at: Federal

 Energy Regulatory Commission, Public Reference Room, 888 First Street

 NE., Room 2A, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 502-8371.

     In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ)

 regulations implementing NEPA, no agency decision on a proposed action

 may be made until 30 days after the U.S. Environmental Protection

 Agency publishes a notice of availability of the final EIS in the

 Federal Register. However, the CEQ regulations provide an exception to

 this rule when an agency decision is subject to a formal internal

 appeal process that allows other agencies or the public to make their

 views known. In such cases, the agency decision may be made at the same

 time the notice of the final EIS is published, allowing both periods to

 run concurrently. The Commission decision for this proposed action is

 subject to a 30-day rehearing period.

     Additional information about the project is available from the

 Commission's Office of External Affairs, at (866) 208-FERC, or on the

 FERC Web site (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrary link. Click on the

 eLibrary link, click on ``General Search,'' and enter the docket number

 excluding the last three digits in the Docket Number field (i.e., CP15-

 138). Be sure you have selected an appropriate date range. For

 assistance, please contact FERC Online Support at

 FercOnlineSupport@ferc.gov or toll free at (866) 208-3676; for TTY,

 contact (202) 502-8659. The eLibrary link also provides access to the

 texts of formal documents issued by the Commission, such as orders,

 notices, and rulemakings.

     In addition, the Commission offers a free service called

 eSubscription that allows you to keep track of all formal issuances and

 submittals in specific dockets. This can reduce the amount of time you

 spend researching proceedings

 Washington: Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:



 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Notice of Filing of Notice of Settlement Under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act On July 28, 2016, a Notice of Settlement
Among EFH Properties Company and the United States on behalf of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') and the U.S. Department of the
Interior (``DOI'') was filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
District of Delaware in the bankruptcy proceeding entitled In re Energy Future
Holdings Corp., et al., Case No. 14-10979 (CSS). The proposed Settlement
Agreement is attached to the Notice of Settlement as Exhibit A. The Settlement
Agreement resolves a claim against EFH Properties Company (``EFH Properties''),

Ex-minister poor choice, oil expert says Kowalski 'unsuitable' to run energy,
utilities board

BYLINE: by Rick Haliechuk TORONTO STAR

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 543 words


   An expert on Alberta's oil patch says a former cabinet minister is an
"unsuitable" choice to head the province's new Public Utilities and Energy
Board.

Last week, Premier Ralph Klein announced that his former deputy premier, Ken
Kowalski, would become chairman of the board, which combines the operations of
existing agencies that regulate the oil and gas industry, and set electricity
and natural gas rates within the province.

LACKS QUALIFICATIONS

To some, the 49-year-old Kowalski simply doesn't have the qualifications to do
the job.

"Traditionally, the chairman and the senior people have been well qualified
people with technical or economic backgrounds, people who knew the industry and
yet people who were independent from both the industry and politics," says
George Govier, considered a leading authority on energy regulation in Alberta.

"Mr. Kowalski's appointment is not consistent at all with that," Govier said in
an interview from his Calgary home yesterday. "I think it is most unsuitable."

Kowalski could not be reached for comment.

Govier was a member of the powerful Energy Resources Conservation Board for 30
years, and was also its chairman for 16 years until his retirement in 1978.

(The new board Kowalski is to head will be created from the merger of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board and the Public Utilities Board).

Historically, members and chairmen of the board have come from the ranks of the
Alberta civil service, academia or public regulation. Kowalski, on the other
hand, has been in the Alberta legislature for 15 years, including eight as a
member of the cabinet. He has also been a high school teacher and, for a few
years, a senior government bureaucrat.

"I think, first of all, the fact that his whole background is in politics is
very bad, that is, for the board," Govier said.

"I'm sure Mr. Kowalski is well qualified for what he has been doing but I don't
know that he has any qualifications for the new position."

Govier concedes that it's in the nature of governments to make appointments with
a political flavor, but says it's "unprecedented" to make such appointments to
independent boards.

Govier said he has not seen or heard any criticisms about the appointment from
within the oil and gas industry, but said that's not surprising.

"People in the industry are in a difficult position," he said. "They, of course,
have to work with the premier, they have to work with the new chairman of the
board, so they're not going to say very much."

And, in fact, calls by The Star to some energy companies about the Kowalski
appointment yesterday produced little more than no comments.

But an official with one large oil and gas producer agreed with Govier that the
board has historically operated at arm's length from government.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board is the more powerful of the two agencies
that will be merged.

ISSUES PERMITS

It issues drilling permits to oil and gas companies, and reviews pipeline and
electrical transmission construction projects, while at the same time, keeping a
close eye on protecting Alberta's environment.

The smaller Public Utilities Board is charged with approving retail rates for
electricity and natural gas.

Groups launch campaign calling for independent review of pipeline safety;
Government says oversight already exists

BYLINE: Karen Kleiss, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 503 words


A coalition of 17 landowner and environmental groups launched an advertising
campaign Monday to demand an independent review of pipeline safety in Alberta.

An open letter published in four Alberta newspapers urges Premier Alison Redford
to protect the province's water supply by reviewing the rules governing
pipelines that cross rivers.

The call comes after three pipeline leaks in the past five weeks, including a
break in a Plains Midstream line that poured up to 475,000 litres of oil into
the Red Deer River.

"We've gone the traditional route of lobbying the regulators for years and years
and years, and government, and environment ministers, the whole gauntlet. They
always say 'Smile, be happy, go away,' " said Don Bester of the Alberta Surface
Rights Group, one of the organizations in the coalition.

"We're asking for an independent review of the regulations and the way we're
handling these 40-or 50-year-old pipelines that are crossing our river systems."

The advertisement will run in three central Alberta newspapers and in VUE
weekly.

It is a response to comments made last earlier this month by Plains Midstream
vice-president Stephen Bark, who said the company was lucky because the pipeline
was wasn't flowing and the river was swollen with rainwater.

The advertisement begins with the bold headline: "Are you feeling lucky?"

"With over 320,000 km of oil and gas related pipelines in this province, how
lucky do you feel? Premier Redford, we shouldn't have to rely on luck," the
advertisement reads.

"You must take action to protect our water and our families from oil spills,
starting with an independent review of pipeline safety in Alberta."

Redford said last week she is "certainly not opposed" to a more thorough study
of pipeline integrity in Alberta, but that she won't consider it until the
Energy Resources Conservation Board has completed its investigation into the
recent spills.

Energy Minister Ken Hughes has previously said the regulations that are
currently in place are sufficient.

"The systems that we have in place today are appropriate," Hughes said last
week. "The energy industry currently is accountable already for every foot of
pipeline that they have, and they conduct themselves with that accountability
under the regulatory framework that we have in Alberta."

Energy Resources Conservation Board spokesman Bob Curran said Monday that
section 43 of Alberta's Pipeline Regulation currently requires companies to
conduct annual inspections of pipelines that cross over rivers.

Curran said companies recognize the repercussions of spills - both social and
environmental - and that "it's not like companies are actively trying to
sidestep regulation."

He said 90 field inspectors conduct targeted inspections across the province. In
2011, they conducted more than 1,700 inspections and investigations.

Curran said they also ensure companies are conducting the required annual
inspections at river crossings. There are thousands of river crossings in
Alberta, but the precise number is not known.

Alberta upholds Shell oil sands permit

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; BUSIENSS TICKER / NORTH AMERICA; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 172 words


Alberta's energy regulator denied a request by environmental groups to reopen
its approval of a key oil sands permit for Royal Dutch Shell PLC. RDS.A-N The
decision drew immediate criticism from the Pembina Institute, which had sought
to have Shell censured for failing to live up to a commitment to dramatically
reduce the carbon footprint of its oil sands-produced fuels. Shell made that
commitment as part of the process of achieving regulatory approval for its
Jackpine oil sands mine. But the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board
ruled that while "Shell has not met the timelines for setting a GHG target," the
company's greenhouse gas commitment did not form a basis for the Jackpine
approval - and, as such, breaking it would not trigger further consequences.
Shell spokeswoman Janet Annesley says the company sees "carbon dioxide
regulations replacing" other commitments it has made, but Simon Dyer, Pembina's
oil sands director, said the ERCB decision sets a bad precedent. RDS.A (Nasdaq)
fell $1.01 to $54.41 (U.S.)

INDUSTRY BREATHES EASIER ON OIL RIG WASTE ISSUE

BYLINE: KENNETH REID; Journal of Commerce Special

SECTION: OIL, Pg. 7B

LENGTH: 553 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The oil industry is breathing easier after learning that the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is not expected to classify oil rig waste as a hazardous
material.

In a final report to be sent to Congress Monday, the EPA is expected to say hat
it plans to leave regulation of oil rig waste to state governments.

The report is required under 1980 amendments to the federal Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which exempted the oil and gas industry from
hazardous waste disposal rules.

EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods declined to reveal contents of the final report, but
said it will not differ much from a draft released in August. She said EPA "may
look at gaps in state laws." on hazardous waste disposal.

The prospect that oil and gas industry waste will remain exempt has led the
American Petroleum Institute to back off from its earlier estimate that disposal
costs to oil, natural gas and geothermal producers would be $ 44 billion in the
first year.

James Collins, a conservation engineer for Atlantic Richfield Co. in Dallas and
chairman of the API's committee on environmental conservation, said the group's
cost estimates wereprovided earlier this year when it looked as though EPA might
require all produced water and drilling muds to be considered hazardous.

Individual oil and gas drillers would need federal permits to dispose of their
waste if the industry were forced to follow resource conservation rules.
Disposal could mean hauling mud and water to tanks for treatment instead of
using injection wells to recover wastewater, as is currently done.

Mr. Collins said EPA will probably toss the ball to the states "because they
really haven't surveyed them fully to find out how their laws are working."

In the draft, however, EPA hinted there was some need for improvement in
enforcement of state laws among 32 states surveyed. For instance, inter-agency
conflicts in Arkansas lead some operators to not "always comply, or believe they
need to comply" with all of that state's disposal rules, the draft reported.

Alaska, EPA noted, allows for some discharge of some waste into environmentally
sensitive tundra, and Texas allows discharge of wastewater and waste drilling
mud into tidally affected estuaries and bays off the Gulf of Mexico.

Congress is expected to hold hearings on the report this winter because the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act comes up for reauthorization in 1988.
Congress could make a decision about energy industry waste in conjunction with
reauthorization.

EPA also will hold its own community hearings in February and March. The agency
has until June 30 to make recommendations to Congress about the handling of oil
industry waste.

EPA was required to file the report with Congress by Dec. 31 under a 1985 court
order won by the Alaska Center for the Environment, demanding the agency move
more rapidly. The group contends at least 10 percent of wastewater and drilling
muds in the United States should be declared hazardous and subject to the Act,
Executive Director Stephanie Kessler said.

She called the EPA's report deficient, contending the agency has "yet to make a
determination of whether oil and gas waste is hazardous or not." Ms. Kessler
added that continued study of state laws will only further delay federal action.

Program makes efficient use of funds

SECTION: A; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 283 words


Regarding current budget threats to our program: Iowa's 16 Resource Conservation
and Development areas are leading efforts within their regions to create jobs
related to Scenic Byways, historic resource protection and revitalization,
natural resource-based business development, Farmers' Market promotion, local
food system development, and development of renewable energy systems. Limestone
Bluffs RC&D covers Cedar, Clinton, Delaware, Dubuque, Jackson, and Jones
counties.

In FY 2010, Iowa RC&Ds reported project activities that resulted 33 businesses
created, 257 businesses expanded and 147 businesses retained. These projects
also resulted in 202 jobs created, 316 jobs retained, and 151 seasonal jobs
created. Resource Conservation and Development Areas are leaders in their areas
in rural economic development and natural resource conservation. The RC&Ds and
their nonprofit volunteer boards are working hard to address strategic
priorities. The technical assistance that is provided through the USDA to local
RC&D councils is the real catalyst that helps councils put the human and
financial resources together to make projects happen. In 2010, the Iowa RC&Ds
were able to take the relatively small investment in USDA-RC&D funds ($1,929,658
in FY 2010) and leverage that into $26,022,901 of project investment from other
federal, state and local sources. RC&D's performance in business and job
creation and their ability to turn a relatively small capital investment of
federal dollars into a significant economic return to the state warrants their
continued existence. We sincerely encourage the Administration and Congress to
restore full funding for the RC&D program for FY 2011 and FY 2012.

Alberta Energy Regulator to be split in two?; Notley says agency's marching
orders are contradictory

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Calgary Herald, With Files From James Wood, Calgary Herald

SECTION: ALBERTA; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 748 words


The NDP government will review the "conflicting mandate" of the province's
oilpatch watchdog with a view to separating its responsibility to both promote
and police energy development, says Premier Rachel Notley.

"One of the concerns that I have always had with the Alberta Energy Regulator is
that it appears to have a conflicting mandate, in that it is both a promoter of
energy and the primary vehicle of environmental protection in Alberta," Notley
said in an interview.

"What's troubling about the AER is it has actually taken over responsibility for
most of the environmental protection and monitoring part and standards
development within the energy sector. ... You can't do that job when your
overarching mandate is to promote energy development."

Notley said Friday she thinks those mandates have to be "split."

The premier's comments come as the new NDP government is in the midst of several
major policy initiatives affecting the province's energy sector, including a
review of royalty rates, a new climate change strategy, higher corporate taxes
and a promise to ban natural gas drilling in urban areas.

The Progressive Conservatives established the AER in December 2012 to provide
one-stop shopping for regulatory approvals after industry complained about the
delays and costs of red tape.

The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with
responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to
create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act, the Environmental
Protection and Enhancement Act, and the Water Act. Notley said notwithstanding
that there are "good people" working on the environmental files, the agency
needs a mandate that "allows for a clear plan of action in every situation."

In the past, she has been harshly critical of the PC government's decision to
appoint former oilpatch executive Gerry Protti to head the AER. Notley said two
years ago she was appalled at the appointment of an industry insider to head the
agency.

Response to her suggestion to split the AER was mixed Monday.

Gary Leach, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada,
rejected the contention the AER promotes energy development.

"The AER is looked to by many jurisdictions in North America and around the
world as a leading regulator for energy projects," Leach said in an email. "The
primary role of the AER ... is focused on environmental protection, public
safety and resource conservation - not the promotion of energy development."

Leach said the AER has taken on some regulatory functions formerly residing at
other government departments to facilitate full life cycle oversight of energy
projects "from conception through operations to final decommissioning and
reclamation."

"We think this provides better and closer oversight of energy projects in
Alberta with a view to protecting the public interest."

But Bill Andrew, CEO of Long Run Exploration, said there will be support within
the oilpatch for splitting up AER's functions because the current regulator has
too much on its plate.

"The system works very well but ... when I was younger, I felt there was a much
more hands-on ERCB and they would interact with you a hell of a lot more and try
to really steer you forcibly in the right path," said the industry veteran.

Mike Hudema, Greenpeace energy campaigner, said the AER has "long been a broken
agency."

"We commend the premier for being willing to look at its mandate and hopefully
reform this body into one that can instil trust, provide transparency and ensure
the safety of our environment and communities," Hudema said in an email. "It
won't be an easy fix, but is a necessary one."

But Wildrose energy critic Leela Aheer said it would be "a huge mistake" to chop
up the AER when it is just getting over "serious growing pains."

"This will seriously promote instability in the sector," said the
Chestermere-Rocky View MLA. "If you split it up, it brings uncertainty and
political risk and it hurts investment. ... It seems inherently wrong to go and
change that when it seems to be working."

But Liberal interim leader David Swann applauded Notley's decision. "It has long
been a criticism, both inside and outside the legislature, that this
organization is not improving the reputation of Alberta, partly because it has
this internal appearance of conflict of interest, promoting and policing the
industry at the same time," he said. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia Network Inc.

Wind Generators are increasing in popularity as people look for ways to reduce
their electric bills. Home owners and farmers are looking for ways to harness
the wind, sun and locally grown crops to generate electricity for their homes
and farming operations, and to sell back to the electric company. The problem is
most of us don't know what it takes to install a Wind Turbine or what the costs
and payback will be.

Those questions will be answered at a meeting in Pampa on Wednesday, December 9.

The meeting will be held at the USDA Service Center meeting room in the Gray

by noon.

Dr. Steve Amosson from the Texas AgriLife Extension Service will discuss the
economics of installing small and medium sized wind turbines for home and farm
electricity generation. Dr. Amosson will discuss what it costs to buy and
maintain a wind generator. Representatives-from Xcel Energy will also be on the
program to discuss what you have to do to connect your wind generator to the
electrical grid.

According to John Crowell, Coordinator for the North Rolling Plains Resource
Conservation and Development Office in Pampa, "There are a lot of things a
person needs to consider when planning the installation of a wind turbine. You
don't just buy a small wind turbine, put it up and plug it in to the electric
grid. There is a permitting process you must go through with your electric
company. There are special meters that must be installed to measure the amount
of electricity you put back into the electric grid.

In some towns you may need a permit and city approval before you can put up a
wind turbine in the city limits. The purpose of the meeting in Pampa on December
9th is to provide the information people need to know about the installation of
Wind Turbines and bio-fuel electric generators."

The meeting is co-sponsored by the North Rolling Plains Resource Conservation
and Development Council, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the
Gray County Texas AgriLife Extension Service. For more information call John
Crowell at 806-662-2551.

Washington: PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A FINAL RULE OF THE
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT

LENGTH: 470  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the
following house proceeding:



  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 74, I call up
the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 36) providing for congressional disapproval
under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the final rule of the Bureau
of Land Management relating to ``Waste Prevention, Production Subject to
Royalties, and Resource Conservation'', and ask for its immediate consideration.
The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.
Hultgren). Pursuant to House Resolution

 74, the joint resolution is considered read.

The text of the joint resolution is as follows: H.J. Res. 36 Resolved by the
Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled, That Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land
Management relating to ``Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and
Resource Conservation'' (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18, 2016)),
and such rule shall have no force or effect. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from California (Mr.
Lowenthal) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from
Utah. General Leave Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent
that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on
H.J. Res. 36. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the
gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I
yield myself such time as I may consume. For the last decade, there has been an
ongoing renaissance in the United States in energy production. It has changed
our geopolitics; our economy has been strengthened; our security has been
enhanced; and there have been thousands of new, good-paying jobs that have been
created from it. This energy boom, according to a 2015 survey, has saved the
American family around $1,000 a year, and this growth of the last decade has
come in spite of consistent anti-energy policies of the previous
administration's. It has especially hit those of us in the West very hard--those
who are public land States in the West--who use our resources to fund our
infrastructure and to pay for our schools and our essential government services.
This rule, which is allegedly to help the environment, actually is designed to
stop production; therefore, it becomes a prime candidate for a repeal under the
Congressional Review Act, which was passed into law in 1996 and signed by
President Clinton. At that time, Clinton said that this was a great way for
Congress to be held accountable>

World Environment Day observed in Visakhapatnam

SECTION: VISAKHAPATNAM

LENGTH: 683 words


VISAKHAPATNAM: Large number of organisations celebrated World Environment Day in
various parts of the city on Friday. Hundreds gathered on Beach Road to
participate in a green rally to spread awareness about the need to protect the
environment.

At Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, around 500 saplings were planted on the
Visakhapatnam Steel Plant premises and another 1,500 saplings were planted in
the Ukkunagaram township. RINL director (operations) DN Rao said that strategies
should be adopted for resource conservation and exhorted all to make resource
conservation a way of life.

Visakhapatnam Port celebrated World Environment Day by continuing its plantation
of about 40,000 two-year-old saplings under the Green Visakha Plantation
Programme, as committed to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and
Technology, Environment and Forests, by planting 1,000 saplings on Friday.

The plantation drive is being taken up in the port areas, including around stack
yards, at a cost of about Rs 3.20 crore. The drive, which is slated to be
completed by August end, will see VPT maintain the trees for two years. VPT
chairman MT Krishna Babu planted saplings in port areas opposite the sewage
treatment plant and near the port connectivity road junction in the western
sector.

Meanwhile, Gangavaram Port Limited marked the day by initiating a massive green
belt development programme at the port premises to create awareness and express
its commitment towards environmental sustainability, energy conservation and
resource conservation. With an objective to create resources for the future, the
Green Belt Development program at Gangavaram Port will include plantation of
over 15,000 saplings in the port area during the week. GPL plans to plant 35,000
saplings in the port area under the green belt programme and 20,000 saplings
around the neighborhood areas like HB Colony, Yarada Hills, Venkannapalem, BC
Road, Swatantra Nagar and Y-Junction under the Green Visakha program by December
2015. Under the Green Visakha programme 2014-15 Gangavaram Port Ltd has already
successfully planted 30,000 saplings in its premises with a 98% survival rate.
Participating in a meeting at HPCL-Visakh Refinery, B Madhusudana Rao of APPCB
explained the various sources of pollution and possible effects of the same on
the environment. He also explained the effects of wastage of resources and
emphasized the need to reduce wastage in everyday living through simple
initiatives.

Andhra Petrochemicals Limited undertook a sapling plantation drive in the plant
area to create awareness among employees on the environment. CEO VN Rao planted
a sapling and said that protection of the environment is the responsibility of
every citizen.

Meanwhile, as part of World Environment Day celebrations at Gitam university,
its vice-chancellor Prof G Subrahmanyam stressed on the need to develop capacity
for sustainable management of natural resources such as water, air, soil and
biodiversity. He highlighted the need for renewable energy, green buildings,
water harvesting, carbon neutrality and afforestation. He reiterated the
commitment of the university to continue green and clean campus drive.
University pro vice-chancellor Prof D Harinarayana briefed about the concept and
benefits of green economy. There is immense need to tackle environmental issues
in a holistic manner, he added.

Meanwhile, Anil Neerukonda Institute of Technology and Sciences conducted a
national workshop on 'Planning of a smart city: Waste management and pollution
control.' ANITS principal Prof VSRK Prasad said with the climatic changes taking
place in the country, student engineers should contribute towards controlling
pollution by introducing environmental friendly technologies.

Tata Power's Club Enerji organises mega rally to propagate energy conservation
in Thane

LENGTH: 505  words

DATELINE: Mumbai


Tata Group Limited has issued following press release:

Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation programme, Club Enerji, has
constantly endeavoured to bring about an active change in attitude amongst
citizens towards curbing energy-wastage through active measures and preserving
Mother Earth. Continuing with the momentum, DAV School through its Mini Club
hosted a mega rally in association with Tata Power Club Enerji and Smt.
Sulochanadevi Singhania School, Lok Puram Public School, Shri Harkrishan English
High School and St John The Baptist High School in Thane.

More than 250 students across these 5 schools joined hands and participated in
the mega rally in order to sensitise citizens on the need for resource
conservation, optimum utilisation of natural wealth and the benefits of
conserving environmental capital, resources and manpower. The rally kicked off
from Tulsi Dham society with school students enthusiastically chanting slogans
"Bring change drastic, cut plastic" and "One solution, reduce pollution",
carrying handmade posters and banners and carrying placards with paintings
depicting different ways of conserving resources. The students sensitised over
2000 people, distributing handmade badges as a water conservation souvenir.
Furthermore, students interacted with pedestrians and spoke enthusiastically
about the three R's-Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, reminding them that Mumbai is "Our
City, Our Duty".

The highlight of the event was the enthusiastic 'Lezim Dance' which is a form of
folk dance of Maharashtra, performed by the students and the drum bands. This
was followed by a musical skit on Water Conservation and a unique dance
performance on water crisis. The Tata Power Club Enerji Educators addressed the
students and encouraged them to keep their passion and unwavering commitment for
the environment alive.

Speaking on this initiative, Anil Sardana, managing director and CEO, Tata
Power, commented, "Club Enerji provides a platform for children to share and
expand their understanding and aims to bring about a chain-reaction towards
reducing wastage of energy and natural resources. Tata Power understands that
children at a young age need to be taught about resource conservation for a
greener tomorrow which has been achieved through Club Enerji's efforts. We are
extremely proud that our young torch bearers are full of fresh enthusiasm and
vigour which only inspires us further. We appreciate the active participation
from the students, teachers and the principal for extending their support to
this initiative."

The day kicked off with prayers, chanting of Gayatri Mantra and Ganesh Vandana
dance by students. DAV School principal addressed the students during her
welcome speech. At the close of the event, feedback was collected from students
and each student returned to their respective schools with a promise to continue
teaching and campaigning environment friendly issues.

U.S. Facilities Hit on Environmental Violations

BYLINE: Michael Weisskopf, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A7

LENGTH: 434 words


At the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, the ground water is contaminated
with cancer-causing wastes, including levels of the solvent trichlorethylene
(TCE) 5,000 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency's standard.

The Department of Energy's nuclear fuel processing center in Ohio dumps 109
million gallons of highly radioactive wastes into storm sewers every year.

At Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Mo., the cancer-causing
solvent 1,2-dichloroethane laces the ground water at levels up to 26,000 times
higher than the EPA permits.

According to a House subcommittee report released yesterday, these three cases
illustrate a pattern among federal facilities of environmental violations and
resistance to the kind of cleanup requirements the EPA imposes on private
polluters.

Of 16 military bases and weapons-production facilities cited by the EPA for
violations, 13 have ground water contamination. Twelve installations took an
average of two years from the detection of violations until they agreed to steps
to correct them.

Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
oversight and investigations subcommittee, said DOE's weapons-production
facilities and Defense Department installations represent the nation's "worst
violators" of hazardous-waste laws. He charged that the attitudes of the two
departments range from "reluctant compliance to active disregard for the law."

Neither Defense nor Energy officials could be reached for comment.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) -- which regulates the
storage, handling and disposal of toxic waste -- calls on federal departments to
"comply with all requirements." But the law does not spell out the EPA's power
of enforcement against federal agencies, and the Justice Department holds that
RCRA violations at federal facilities are "interagency disputes" to be resolved
by the president.

The EPA detected numerous RCRA violations at Picatinny Arsenal near Dover, N.J.,
as long ago as December 1985. They included leaking containers of hazardous
waste and inadequate plans to clean up earthen disposal pits, according to the
report. Despite repeated notifications, the Army has refused to correct the
violations, it said.

At DOE's Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio, which processes
uranium fuel for nuclear weapons, the first RCRA violations were discovered in
March 1984. While agreeing last March -- two days before a House hearing -- to
correct the problems, DOE has not signed the agreement or completed the work,
the report said.

  Per capita, Canadians are the largest energy consumers in the world.
Ecology-conscious homeowners can help clean up the environment by conserving
energy, and save a few hundred dollars on fuel bills each year, says an article
in this month's Financial Post Moneywise magazine. The recommendations include
sealing off your home's air leakage, servicing the heating system annually and
replacing old furnaces

Energy saving gets hit hard

BYLINE: Carolyn Green

SECTION: SECTION 1; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 198 words


  THE FEDERAL government has put one more nail in the energy conservation coffin
with its budget announcement that certain materials will no longer be exempt
from federal taxes.

According to the proposal, a number of energy conservation products will be hit
with a 6% federal sales tax on July 1. These include heat pumps, heat recovery
units, solar panels and tubes for solar heating systems, thermal insulation for
pipes and ducts used in buildings and mechanical systems, and wood-burning
stoves.

The extra tax is not surprising, since it follows the reduction and eventual
elimination of two key energy-conservation programs in the November economic
statement.

At that time, Finance Minister Michael Wilson announced the March 31, 1985,
termination of the Canadian Oil Substitution Plan, which paid 50% of the cost,
up to $800, of home heating conversion from oil to gas, electricity, renewable
and other energy sources.

Also chopped - but on a more gradual basis - was the Canadian Home Insulation
Plan, which provided 60% of the cost, up to $500, for insulation materials and
labor. That amount was reduced in January to 33 1 3% until March 31, 1986.

Residents protest proposed oil well; Policy reviewed for projects in urban
centres

BYLINE: Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 468 words


Northwest residents gathered Sunday to protest a proposed oil well near a
bustling shop-ping centre cheered news that provincial officials are mulling a
new urban policy for oil and gas projects.

Despite the drizzling rain, more than 100 Rocky Ridge and Royal Oak residents
gathered to voice their concerns about Kaiser Exploration's well near a Walmart
off Country Hills Boulevard.

A cheer went up from protesters when Calgary North-West MLA Sandra Jansen
announced the province is considering a new policy for drilling within municipal
bounds.

"Energy minister Ken Hughes has indicated to me that they have begun the process
of working on an urban policy for oil and gas development," Jansen said. "This
is one of the most important things in this community, and our government
listened . . . whatever we craft here is going to be a watershed for this
province."

Hughes, who toured the proposed well site last week, said he has instructed his
staff to review the province's options when it comes to energy development
within municipal boundaries.

"A review of policy options will allow us to ensure we find the appropriate
balance between opportunities for responsible resource development and respect
for the interests of Albertans and property owners," Hughes said in a letter
Friday.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is reviewing Kaiser's drilling
licence for the site, which is 500 metres from the nearest residence in the
city's north-west.

"We don't want it here. It's just too close," said Ward Sutherland of Rocky
Ridge Royal Oak Community Association.

He said residents have expressed myriad concerns about the project, from the
proximity of the site to residences, to concerns over its effect on traffic and
the environment.

Resident Brenda McGahey said she's worried about an evacuation if there's an
accident or toxic leak.

"There's only two routes out of here . . . to get thousands of individuals out
of here would be difficult. We need to know what their evacuation plan is and
they don't have one," she said.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board has pointed out that the well, which is
for sweet oil, not the more hazardous sour gas, poses little danger to the
public.

But local alderman Dale Hodges said residents have good reason to be concerned.

"They say this is a sweet oil well, but if they drill (further) down, it turns
to sour gas. They could end up with a sour gas well. They don't intend to, but
it could happen," Hodges said.

Hodges said he hopes the project will receive a hearing at Alberta Surface
Rights Board.

"Then at least the city and the community will get a say at a public hearing,"
he said.

The ERCB is expected to complete its review of the Kaiser project before the end
of August.

Royal Oak is situated near the northwest corner of the city

5 QUESTIONS for Moe Tabrizi, first director of sustainability at the University
of Colorado

BYLINE: Elise Trivers, For the Camera

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 640 words


If you go


What:  Sustainability Leadership Brown Bag Series, with Moe Tabrizi, CU's
director of sustainability, and Susan Beckett, CU Environmental Center energy
program manager

 When:  Noon to 1 p.m. Wednesday

 Where:  University Memorial Center, Room 245

 Last year, Moe Tabrizi was named the University of Colorado's first director of
sustainability. He works with the CU Environmental Center, as well as other
organizations within CU such as Housing and Dining Services and the student
government, to further goals of sustainability on the campus and in the
community.





 One of Tabrizi's short-term goals is meeting energy, water and petroleum
reductions outlined by the governor's office by 2012. His long-term hope for the
Boulder campus is complete carbon neutrality.



 Tabrizi will be speaking Wednesday as part of CU's "Sustainability Leadership
Brown Bag Series." The topic of this week's discussion is "Resource Conservation
Strategies and Results."







 1. How did you come to hold this position at CU?



 I've been with the campus since 2002, as an energy conservation officer. Over
the past eight or nine years, obviously the focus from purely energy
conservation has grown to water conservation, building green buildings and
really expanding the domain of conservation to include sustainability. It made
sense to change the title to indicate the focus, but in practice, things are not
much different; I still work very closely with the Environmental Center and the
students. The title is an indication the campus is putting more focus on
sustainability. It probably makes it a little easier to interact and connect
with one place, with the partnership between the Environmental Center, housing
and other functions within the university.



 2. What does it mean to you personally?



 I'm committed to give recognition of how important conservation and
sustainability is to our buildings, our environment, to students, to our
students' future in terms of challenges, in terms of career opportunities. I
really enjoy helping the campus to focus and make some changes and move the
needle slightly towards better results; it's kind of exciting.



 3. What will you be speaking about this week during the "Resource Conservation
Strategies and Results" lecture?



 I will be talking about our short-term and long-term sustainability goals and
actually sharing some of our quantifiable results. That's always exciting to
have some data to show that you are moving in the right direction.



 4. Why do you think it's important to get a partnership among students,
residents and businesses?



 I'm not good with one-handed clapping; it's never impressive when you're trying
to do things. Small things can be done by individuals; large things have to be
done in a partnerships and collaborations. The students are the sources of
energy and ideas. My job is I basically try to add reality to those ideas and
add implementation to those ideas.



 5. Is there anything specific right now that you're excited about?



 At times, our ideas are ahead of means and budget, but that's the fun
challenge. We have seven solar installations on campus so far, and we are
working on three more. It's exciting the way that we're implementing renewable
energy without spending any money from campus; we're forming partnerships with
third-party financing. The other thing that's important for us are the
governor's energy orders. They basically say, against a baseline of 2006, by
2012 to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent, water consumption by 10
percent, petroleum use by 25 percent and paper use by 20 percent. We have formed
several teams focused on achieving those goals, tracking and quantifying them,
being able to show us getting closer. In some cases, we are ahead of the goals,
some we're still working, but so far we've been pretty bullish about
accomplishing them.

Groups warn of quake lawsuit against state energy companies

BYLINE: By Paul Monies Business Writer pmonies@oklahoman.com

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 913 words


Two environmental groups have warned Oklahoma oil and gas companies of their
intent to file a federal lawsuit over the links between wastewater disposal
wells and the state's sharp rise in earthquake activity.Washington-based Public
Justice and the Oklahoma Sierra Club said they plan to bring a lawsuit under the
federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a 1976 law which allows citizen
lawsuits over hazardous waste. They want the companies to reduce the volumes of
wastewater injected into disposal wells. They also want to establish an
"independent forecasting body" that will investigate, analyze and predict the
cumulative effect of injecting production wastewater.The groups sent certified
letters last week detailing their intent to SandRidge Energy Inc., Devon Energy
Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp. and New Dominion LLC."I am angry and offended
that the oil and gas industry has been so slow to protect Oklahoma and its
citizens in the face of this earthquake crisis," Barbara Vanhanken, chairwoman
of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement released Monday.

"Stopping this ever-strengthening earthquake crisis is critical to the health
and well-being of all Oklahomans.&nbsp;To ignore the human cost being paid for
the earthquake problems tied to oil and gas operations in Oklahoma is
cold-blooded and heartless.&nbsp;It reinforces the concept that profits matter
more than people."Devon and Chesapeake declined to comment. New Dominion's
general counsel, Fred Buxton, said he had seen the letter but couldn't comment.
SandRidge did not return calls for comment.&nbsp;Oklahoma has had more than 720
earthquakes greater than 3.0-magnitude this year, surpassing last year's total
of 585 in that category. Several scientific papers have linked the state's
increase in earthquakes to higher volumes of produced water disposal from oil
and gas activity.Regulators at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission have focused
on wastewater injections into the deep Arbuckle formation, long a favored
disposal location for the extremely salty "fossil water" that comes up with oil
and natural gas. Some operators had drilled through the Arkbuckle into the
crystalline basement, increasing the risk of triggered earthquakes. They were
asked to reduce the depths of those wells, while other wells came under
voluntary directives to reduce volumes or shut in completely.Two earthquakes
struck central Oklahoma on Monday, including a 4.4-magnitude quake about four
miles west of Langston at 10:57 a.m. That was followed by a 3.4-magnitude quake
at 11:35 a.m. about five miles northeast of Langston. There were no immediate
reports of injury or damage.Energy group respondsChad Warmington, president of
the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, said the environmental groups were
attempting to use federal law to undermine the work of the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission."This is nothing more than business as usual for these groups in
their attempts to completely destroy the production of oil and natural gas in
the United States," Warmington said in an email. "Their threatened lawsuit is
completely unnecessary and unwarranted."Warmington pointed to a three-hour
hearing on induced seismicity last week at the Capitol that included
presentations from the Oklahoma Geological Survey, Corporation Commissioner Dana
Murphy and the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board."The actions taken by the
commission have been strong, decisive and based on good science," he said. "Any
outside group that claims otherwise is either ill-informed or willfully
deceitful. The Corporation Commission has this under control and does not need
the federal government interfering in their processes."Injection volumes
detailedThe letter from Public Justice and the Sierra Club included several
attachments detailing the volumes of wastewater injected by SandRidge,
Chesapeake, New Dominion and Devon. Using volume data collected by the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission, it said the companies accounted for 59 percent of the
saltwater injected into the Arbuckle formation in 2014.SandRidge, with 91
Arbuckle disposal wells, accounted for 201.7 million of the 673 million barrels
of wastewater injected into the Arbuckle formation last year. Chesapeake had 14
disposal wells injecting 73.9 million barrels in that formation. New Dominion
injected 72.1 million barrels into the Arbuckle in 2014, while Devon injected
64.5 million barrels of wastewater, according to commission data compiled by
Public Justice.Paul Bland, Public Justice's executive director, said any lawsuit
brought under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act would be the first of
its kind regarding the risks from induced seismicity from disposal wells. He
said the groups would show the ongoing injection volumes are posing "an imminent
and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.""The ball is totally
in their court," Bland said of the companies. "They could work out something
with us, or they could fight us in court."Bland said the increase in number and
severity of earthquakes in Oklahoma increases the risk."Think of a big crack in
a piece of ice and you were tapping on it with a hammer or chisel," he said.
"Each tap may not be significant, but at some point the crack begins to
change."Public Justice has used the law successfully to fight harmful runoff
from manure produced from large dairy farms in Yakima, Wash. It's also used the
law over large deposits of coal ash in Pennsylvania, Bland said.

Tiny Caroline, Alta. is suddenly on gas map

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 17, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 1199 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


This morning in the Rocky Mountain foothills town of Caroline, Alta., population
380, the natural gas production industry will begin a summer-long trek across a
regulatory watershed.

Four years ago, Caroline was a country crossroads, a rural stereotype buried in
the lodgepole pine forests of Alberta's eastern slopes.

A school, a community hall, churches, a cemetery, gas stations, an RCMP
detachment, a hotel with a beer-smelling bar and a box of a restaurant that
served the same combination of Chinese and country-western fare that has been
available in these small Alberta towns since Chinese laborers finished building
the Canadian Pacific Railway and settled down for keeps.

CLAIM TO FAME

Caroline existed to service a resource economy: farms, oil and gas exploration
crews and production facilities, winter logging, summer church camps and
foothills cattle ranches.

Its most prominent citizen was reclusive rancher Terry Long, a young, bearded
white supremacist with a media following and connections to the Aryan Nation in
Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.

Then, in 1986, Shell Canada Ltd. discovered in the area what has now turned out
to be a giant natural gas and sulphur field; three trillion cubic feet of gas
and what may be half of Alberta's sulphur reserves. Caroline found itself,
overnight, on the international natural gas map.

Today, after months of bitter controversy between Shell and Husky Oil Operations
Ltd., the Energy Resources Conservation Board will begin hearings to determine
how the $10-billion find will be developed.

The board, over an expected three to five weeks of hearings and several more
weeks of deliberations, must decide between two competitive gas processing
options advanced by the companies.

This hearing, however, is not primarily about technology or even economics. It
is about the environmental and social impact of a $750-million to $800-million
development of a find located in a heavily populated rural area and containing
35% sulphur in the form of hazardous hydrogen sulphide gas.

CONFLICTING CULTURES

And it is about two conflicting corporate cultures - each with a legitimate
claim to a solid record of meeting community standards and expectations of
behavior in previous resource production.

At issue will be the extent to which those standards have changed, and whether
the two companies have adapted appropriately to those changes.

The bottom line is: How much economic and technical impact will ecological
greening and the new community responsiveness of the energy industry have on
future resource development in Alberta?

Husky, a minority interest-holder with a 12% interest in Caroline gas and
sulphur reserves, is staking its position around the environmental and societal
issues.

It has a commercial stake in winning the day; it wants to process the Caroline
gas at an aging plant it operates north of the field. That processing right
would help it finance an expansion and upgrade of its processing and
environmental technology.

But the company says the commercial difference between its proposal and Shell's
is not the fundamental issue; as a business proposition it can live with Shell's
option for development.

Husky believes its proposal is the right one for societal and
environmental-impact reasons. The company is determined to do the right thing,
as defined by its cultural and ethical values.

It has also said that, having raised what it considers to be the essential
issues, it will let the chips fall where they may and accept the board's
decision.

STRIKING A BALANCE

Its position puts Husky at the leading edge of corporate response to
environmental and social impact strategy. This does not necessarily make Husky a
more saintly company, or mean that it is more ethical. What it does mean is a
different way of striking the balance between economics and the environment.

On these matters, Shell is a more traditional and more cautious operator. And it
has demonstrated a tougher commercial determination to win. This is not
primarily an exercise in community values for Shell, it is a business
proposition and Shell has threatened to fight a rejection of its proposal by the
board.

Shell's commercial stake in winning has been increased by its decision to couple
with Caroline the development of an adjacent sulphur discovery at the Bearberry
field.

Bearberry's gas reserves are more than 90% sulphur, and Shell has developed a
pilot ''sulphur mine'' production concept which can be interlinked to Caroline
facilities.

It has outspent Husky by an estimated five to one in wooing community support
from people in the area of the find. And it has given consideration to
environmental and social impacts. But there is a different flavor to its
position on these so-called ''soft'' hearing issues.


Perhaps it is best illustrated by a portion of Shell's just released 1989 annual
report. President and Chief Executive Officer Jack MacLeod wrote, ''Management
of the physical environment has assumed comparable priority to management of the
economy . . .

''Sustainable development acknowledges that there are limits to the adverse
environmental impact that can be accepted as the consequence of economic
development. However, it is also important to realize that sustainable
development does not mean the protection and improvement of the environment
regardless of economic cost.''

BOUCHARD'S ROLE

The regulatory process for Caroline is open-ended at this point because the
federal department of the Environment has not shown its hand and there is some
room here for Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard to claim jurisdiction. Some
of the proposed pipelines cross navigable rivers. Caroline will be a substantial
CO2 emitter, and trace amounts of SO2 will get into air that will cross
interprovincial borders.

There is some concern that recent federal court decisions will force Bouchard
into the picture, particularly if pushed by Alberta environmental activists,
much as he has been drawn into the Carmanah Valley question in British Columbia.

As the producer community has come to grips with the dimensions of the Caroline
hearing, there has been considerable anger directed at the board and at Husky.

The industry's old guard argues that the board has no mandate to include
environmental and societal issues in its considerations.

MOST IMPORTANT HEARING

And they say Husky has broken the unwritten rule of operatorship, the notion
that the minority-interest companies in the field ought to defer to Shell as the
finder and majority-interest holder in the field.

This is the most important hearing of the board since it sat, 30 years ago, on
the issue of the first oil sands mine and plant in the province.

The first oil sands hearings dramatically transformed environmental standards
and the management of the conventional oil market and, in a very real sense,
opened the door to the modernization of the Canadian petroleum industry. The
Caroline hearing will define for a new era the board's role in striking the
balance between economic development and environmental protection in Alberta.

IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES? Energy leaders want simpler rules; environmentalists
fear deregulation: ENERGY

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: SUNDAY INSIGHT; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 830 words


described by environmentalists as the most environmentally sensitive
resource-based industry in North America -- was sliding into a decline. Then a
dramatic shift in its financial situation, and environmental reputation, began
to occur as gas prices began to rebound about two years ago. Previously marginal
development became exceedingly profitable, and it became economically feasible
to drill costly deep wells in Alberta's foothills. The provincial government --
facing the prospect of a big jump in royalties it collects and a big drop in the
piece of political poison known as the deficit -- began selling leases in areas
such as Dinosaur Park, the Whaleback and the Sheep Wildlife Sanctuary. The scene
for conflict with environmentalists was set.

Herald environment writer Vicki Barnett looks at both sides of this growing
debate.

Alberta's energy industry often takes the lead on environmental matters, but
gets little credit for it, says the province's energy minister.

For example, the industry has diligently worked on a Clean Air Strategy for
Alberta and voluntarily established a fund to clean up abandoned energy sites,
Energy Minister Pat Black said in an interview.

The industry has also developed a process involving communication with
communities on developments and worked toward new technology on sulphur
extraction of the oilsands, Black said.

In addition, the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), which regulates the
industry, is viewed worldwide as a tough-but-fair regulator that should be
emulated elsewhere.

Environmentalists should praise, not "pooh-pooh," the industry, Black added.

Meanwhile, ERCB board member Brian Bietz said: "It's our intention to increase
the consequences of not meeting the regulations." He was responding to
environmentalists' concerns that regulation is decreasing.

The board plans to focus on inspecting problem operators instead of inspecting
every operation at the same level, Bietz said. Facilities not meeting
regulations could face faster shutdowns, without a 24-hour or week-long grace
period to correct problems.

The board is also considering visiting head offices of problem facilities to
demand the company prove it has a management system to prevent similar problem
at other facilities, he said.

"Give me an example of an industry that's federally regulated that's better
regulated than this industry. Show us what we can do better, and we'll do it,"
Bietz challenged.

Meanwhile, the energy industry points to the dramatic example of Sceptre
Resources Ltd. to show voluntary environmental measures are best for dealing
with some problems such as greenhouse gases.

After conducting an energy audit, the Calgary oil and gas company saved $
540,000 a year on its electrical bill for one medium-sized gas plant.

Sceptre also estimated the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere
was reduced by 19,000 tonnes a year.

While environmentalists insist that mandatory regulations are necessary to
persuade industry to meet international goals of reducing greenhouse gases, the
Sceptre example shows voluntary measures work, said Doug Bruchet, vice-president
of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP).

CAPP -- through its membership of 190 energy companies and 115 energy service
companies -- represents 95 per cent of all gas produced in Canada.

Bruchet noted 23 CAPP members have also agreed to voluntary energy audits and
"we're in the process of negotiating a memorandum of understanding with Natural
Resources Canada that would broaden the participation."

CAPP also favors harmonization of provincial and federal regulations, a prospect
that horrifies environmentalists who believe the federal government is
abandoning its responsibilities.

"That doesn't mean we favor deregulation," Bruchet said. "You don't need federal
and provincial inspectors inspecting the same activity."

Supporting his argument for less duplication or regulations, Bruchet points to a
big black binder containing environmental regulations, codes and standards
applying to the upstream (exploration, drilling and production) end of the
industry.

The black binder -- compiled for CAPP by the Canadian Institute of Resources Law
at U of C -- is an attempt to eliminate duplication and counter
environmentalists' arguments that the oil industry is unregulated. Regulations
are so complex "that a guy needs a lawyer standing beside him just to put a hole
in the ground," Bruchet said.

"Our principal is one project, one review. It's incumbent upon the two
jurisdictions to strike an agreement to have one hearing and to accommodate in
most cases whatever federal statues need to be looked at -- the Indian,
Navigable Waters, Migratory Birds and Fisheries Acts."

The environment can still be protected through harmonization and
rationalization, Bruchet said, noting, "We're not in favor of deregulation, but
smarter regulations and the elimination of duplication."

Stimulus Funds Pay for Energy-Saving Windows at Kitsap Courthouse

BYLINE: Chris Henry, Kitsap Sun, Bremerton, Wash.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 854 words


Jun. 22--PORT ORCHARD -- The Kitsap County Courthouse is being outfitted with
energy-efficient windows as part of the county's push toward energy
conservation. In the long run, county officials say, the grant-funded
expenditure will save money on heating and cooling the building, while reducing
the emission of greenhouse gases.

The window replacement, costing $478,536, is one of several resource
conservation projects funded by a $2.29 million federal stimulus grant. The
project is part of the county's initiative to make its operations more efficient
and environmentally friendly. Grant-funded projects also are aimed at creating
green jobs to promote economic development.

South Kitsap Commissioner Charlotte Garrido, who is heading up the green
initiative, said the windows project could serve as a model for the county as it
moves toward performance-based operations. The grant required the county to
estimate cost savings and jobs created as part of the application process.

The project entails replacement of nearly all first- and second-story windows
with double-paned window units, 95 total, as well as aluminum around courthouse
doors. The county estimates it will save about $25,000 per year in energy costs,
meaning the project will have paid for itself in about 20 years. Over the course
of the installation, the project provided work for 10 to 13 people.

The original courthouse was constructed in 1935, but it has been added onto
multiple times over the years. Parts of the building's exterior date to the
1960s, but most of the renovations were done in the 1970s or a little later, and
the windows that were replaced date to that time frame, said Autumn Salamack,
resource conservation manager for the county.

The county applied in Fall 2009 for an Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant administered by the U.S. Department of Energy. The total grant, received
in December, must be used by early 2012, but the county is a on a fast track to
award contracts for projects and will probably complete the work sooner,
Salamack said.

Salamack's two-year position is funded by the grant. She helps the county comply
with grant regulations, including federal reporting, and is in charge of
developing an energy efficiency and conservation plan for county operations. The
plan will outline specific goals and strategies for reducing utility costs, thus
saving taxpayer dollars, Salamack said.

Stimulus grant projects fall under three headings: green building; the "Kitsap
food chain," aimed at increasing local food sources; and clean technology, which
includes information technology.

Under clean technology, the county has already installed 80 solar trash
compactors at county parks, at a cost of $450,940. Reducing the number of trash
pickups will save the county an estimated $100,000 a year in fuel and labor
costs.

In addition to the courthouse windows, green building projects include
retrofitting the Presidents Hall and the Kitsap Sun Pavilion -- both at Kitsap
County Fairgrounds and Events Center-- with energy efficient components.

The county this fall will implement a retrofitting program for homeowners.
Property owners with low to moderate incomes can get low-interest loans to make
their homes more energy-efficient. The grant provides financial guarantees on
defaulted loans to banks as an incentive for offering lower interest rates.

Salamack will identify other, non-grant-funded ways the county can save money by
going green. Many small changes have already been made, she said. Her job is to
find all areas with potential for cost savings, make them part of regular county
operations and document their effectiveness.

North Kitsap Commissioner Steve Bauer has been pushing for the county to move
toward a performance-based business model that would require documentation of
demonstrable change. The concept came up again Monday, during a commissionersÂ¿
meeting on 2011 budget priorities.

Garrido suggested the stimulus projects as a model the county could follow,
because federal regulations require that the county set measurable goals for use
of the grant money.

Kitsap County Administrator Nancy Buonanno Grennan said department heads have
had performance measures.

"They don't generally measure meaningful things," she said. "They just measure
workload. There's not a lot of rigor to them."

The board of commissioners agreed to make a transition toward performance
measures a priority for 2011. The county's finance department is working on a
budget-setting process that will better show the effectiveness of where and how
each department spends its money.

Save cash by winterizing;
A few things you can do to be more energy efficient

A

s the frosty weather continues to chill the bones when you're out and about,
there are steps you can take to make your house or apartment toastier during the
next few months.

Winterizing your home -- making it more energy efficient, and safer -- can be
easier than you think.

"Air leakage is probably the biggest waste," said J.C. Martel, manager for the
Center for ReSource Conservation's energy audit program in Boulder.

The most significant air leakage usually happens around the edges of a home's
windows. But if you detect a slight breeze even when your windows are tightly
shut, that doesn't mean you need new windows, Martel said. Usually, sealing
around the edges of a window, where its frame meets the drywall and sill, does
the trick.

Not sure if your windows are leaking air or are airtight? Light, then blow out,
a match, and slowly move the smoking stick around the edge of your window. If
you see a sudden change in the smoke's direction, you've got a leak.

Martel suggested using clear, silicone-based caulk to seal edges of your
windows.

While a home with little or no air leakage is ideal in Colorado's winter
climate, it's important that the air that remains in your home is safe. That's
especially true during winter months in a cold climate when windows are locked
tight, and there's little air movement through your home.

Carbon monoxide

Carbon monoxide (CO) is odorless and colorless and highly toxic, and can enter
your home via faulty appliances or water-heater systems. It produces flu-like
symptoms (but no fever) in people who are exposed to it.

According to the Center for Disease Control, roughly 500 people die in the
United States each year from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.

A family of four from Denver died in Aspen over Thanksgiving due to carbon
monoxide poisoning in the home where they were staying. Officials reported the
carbon monoxide leaked from the home's hot water and snow-melting system.

Carbon monoxide detectors are easy to use, said Barry Hight, president of
McGuckin Hardware in Boulder. CO detectors reveal the level of carbon monoxide
per million parts of what's in the air. CO detectors sell for $24-$60 at
McGuckin.

Shutting off water

Hight also suggested knowing where your home's main water shutoff valve is
located. Winter's fluctuating temperatures can cause water pipes to contract and
expand to the point where small leaks form.

If you hear water moving somewhere in your pipes even when your faucets are
turned off, chances are there's a leak.

If you're renting a home, "make sure you let the landlord know of leaks pretty
quickly," Hight said. "That way, they can solve the problem before a lot of
water damage. But, probably, the most important thing in cold weather is to know
where the main water shutoff is.

"If the water gets running in a situation where it gets cold and then it warms
back up, if you hear running water in the house and you can't see where it is,
it's important you get it shut off (at the main shutoff valve)."

Water pipes situated in the walls on the exterior of a home are most susceptible
to freezing and springing a leak, Hight said. If you have water pipes in an
exterior wall, it's good to keep the water running slightly, or at a slow drip,
when the temperatures dip below freezing.

If saving a little money on your utility bill during the winter is a goal,
consider keeping your thermostat at 68 degrees, and turning your hot water
heater temperature gauge to 120 degrees.

And while they're a little more expensive to purchase, studies show compact
fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) are more energy efficient than traditional
incandescent bulbs and can save you money in the long run.

Consider replacing your incandescent light bulbs with CFLs.

Ag, green part of EDC strategy

BYLINE: Rick Longley, Orland Press Register, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 569 words


Apr. 27--Orland is hoping to utilize its agricultural roots and "green"
technology to revitalize its limited economic base.

Those are two important aspects in the city's economic development plan recently
approved by the City Council.

The five-year Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy looks to promote
agricultural tourism, solid waste recycling and employment opportunities by
working with local and regional agencies.

It will be forwarded to the 3CORE Corporation in Chico by the end of this month
for inclusion in that group's regional economic development planning.

The plan recommended by the city's Economic Development Commission did not
change much after council members reviewed it Monday.

It still calls for the city's public safety facility to be built in a remodeled
Purity Market building once construction funding is found. The architectural
plans are already done and ready for use within the next two years.

The plan also seeks to develop business opportunities that include agriculture,
art, natural resources and historic tourism with partners like the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the Central Sacramento Valley Resource Conservation
and Development District and the Glenn County Resource Conservation District
along with Butte Community College and the Glenn County Office of Education,
city officials said.

Council members recommended adding broader language to the "green technology"
and "bio-energy" project listed as sub-section A under the above component.

It should include solar, wind and other sources, Councilman Bruce Roundy said,
along with developing a county bio-energy facility that would convert solid
municipal waste into gas or electrical production.

Expanding fiber optic capacities in the city and county to allow for broadband
Internet access is in the top five as well.

The city will continue to develop its overall economic development strategy
plan, and it will seek grant funding to develop the proposed Stony Creek Park.

Roundy suggested adding bike and pedestrian paths to the park list since those
will be important to its users in the future.

The B priority list also got the council's approval.

It said the city's general plan update should include a historic district
designation within the next five years.

Planners have identified historic sections downtown, but say it is too costly to
have them included in the general plan update being completed this year since
more consultants and paperwork would be needed to gain such a designation, City
Manager Paul Poczobut said.

Building a community center and developing a Stony Creek Trail near the proposed
park also are in the Priority B list.

The C Priority list calls for the extension of Pabst Avenue to the north which
includes the undergrounding of Lateral 40, a water district canal that runs
across the proposed roadway.

Expansion of the Orland Library building also is in this list to be done in the
next 10 years or so.

Pan-Alberta gas contract decision upheld

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 172 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board has acknowledged that energy
producer Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. has sufficient natural gas reserves to fulfill the
term of a 24-year sales contract to California.

The ERCB issued the ''clarification'' after a controversial ruling that denied
Pan-Alberta more than a 15-year export permit for the gas, even though the sale
to Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. had already been approved by the National
Energy Board. The ERCB's ruling has jeopardized the sale.

In a letter to Pan-Alberta, the ERCB stated that the company ''does have
adequate reserves under its control to fulfill the sum of currently existing
contract delivery requirements including those needed for deliveries to southern
California to the year 2012.''

Pan-Alberta said it will continue to seek an export permit to match the terms of
its California sales contract. However, by doing so, it is asking the ERCB to
reverse a policy that normally restricts gas removal permits to a 15-period.

Alberta's new boom from old oil;
Growth in conventional crude production surges to decades-long high as new
drilling techniques tap reserves not previously accessible

BYLINE: CARRIE TAIT, KELLY CRYDERMAN

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ENERGY; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 747 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Conventional oil production in Alberta is exploding, posting growth numbers not
seen since the 1960s, as companies across the province use modern technology to
revive pools of crude once thought inaccessible.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) said energy companies extracted
556,000 barrels of oil a day in 2012 from conventional zones, up 14 per cent
from 2011. It expects output to grow by 7 per cent in 2013.

The conventional oil renaissance is happening as bitumen production from the oil
sands continues to roar ahead, climbing 10 per cent last year to 1.92 million
barrels a day, a production rate set to double within 10 years.

The strong growth in Alberta oil production shows the industry's prowess in
tapping reserves from conventional fields and the oil sands alike. But
fast-rising output also risks adding to a serious problem in the oil patch, as
abundant crude exports run into chronic transportation bottlenecks and weigh on
prices for Alberta companies, largely heavy oil producers, compared with North
American and global benchmarks.

"We're in the midst of a massive increase in North American crude oil supply.
That's generally good news, however the lack of sufficient pipeline capacity is
causing significant regional price disparities," Al Monaco, Enbridge Inc.'s CEO,
said on a first-quarter conference call Wednesday.

"We're all concerned about the short-term and longer-term effects this could
have on energy development," Mr. Monaco said.

Enbridge and other pipeline companies have plans for a number of new projects to
accommodate more of Alberta's oil exports.

But several, such as Enbridge's Northern Gateway and TransCanada Corp.'s
Keystone XL, face uncertainty amid political battles in places such as British
Columbia and criticism by environmental groups.

Alberta's conventional oil boom is largely the result of horizontal drilling
coupled with multistage hydraulic fracturing (or "fracking") techniques that
allow companies to tap formations once viewed out of reach or unprofitable. In
addition to rising production, conventional crude reserves grew 9.5 per cent
last year, the ERCB said.

The growth in conventional oil production gives small and mid-sized outfits a
chance to attract attention - and capital - after years of losing ground to
major oil sands projects. The ERCB, however, expects conventional crude
production will begin to decline in 2014, meaning the boom could end unless
another technological revolution kicks in.

Scott Saxberg, president and CEO of Crescent Point Energy Corp., is among those
who believe the industry's good fortunes will continue.

"We're just at the front end of the technology change," he said. "In the next
five to 10 years, we're going to see even more advancements in that technology
and the knowledge we have around developing these assets using the multistage
fracking horizontal drilling."

These techniques, however, are expensive. Trent Yanko, Legacy Oil + Gas Inc.'s
CEO, said this is the conventional industry's Achilles heel. Production, he
noted, also falls off very rapidly.

"So as much as there's a peak, it will be short-lived without more capital and
more drilling to keep that ahead of the decline rates," he said.

Yangarra Resources Ltd. CEO Jim Evaskevich, however, believes the industry can
solve the cost conundrum.

"We're finding that our results continue to improve, our costs continue to come
down," he said. While the cost to drill and frack a well remain the same, the
fracks - the wedges created in the reservoir after injecting sand, water, and
chemicals underground - are bigger and better, bringing down the cost per
barrel.

Transportation, however, remains a key problem. This drives the oil price
differential - the spread between benchmark crude and oil from Western Canada -
and cuts into provincial royalties and corporate profits.

"Perhaps we need to work harder as a country to ensure that we're able to get
access to world markets as opposed to just U.S. markets," Mr. Evaskevich said.

"We believe [this] will tighten that differential and of course be good for
everybody."

SMELLY LEAK 'NOT DANGEROUS'

BYLINE: JOHN GRADON AND VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 364 words


Sour gas odor did not threaten health, says ERCB

Yes, it caused a stink.

But no, there wasn't any danger.

That's the crux of a report by Energy Resources Conservation Board investigators
into weekend reports of sour gas smells in an area southeast of the city.

"While the odor was a major nuisance, there was never any threat to public
health and safety," said Dave Hill, the ERCB's Calgary south field office
assistant area supervisor, summing up the board's report into the incident.

But, Hill added Monday, "We may never be able to determine the actual source of
the odors."

Calgary fire department, city police and Strathmore RCMP went to the Chestermere
Lake area Saturday evening after a resident complained.

At one point Chestermere residents were put on evacuation notice, but were not
required to do so.

ERCB inspectors identified two potential sources of the smell oil production
facilities about five kilometres south of Chestermere, but not sour gas wells as
suspected.

One facility, operated by Imperial Oil, was found to be not entirely secure
because a "wellhead valve was not closed," said the report.

And at the other facility, operated by Atlantic Energy, oil and flaring solution
gas were being produced until a company representative secured it Saturday
night.

"We had good co-operation from both Atlantic and Imperial during our
investigations," said Hill.

Meanwhile, concerns over the incident and its ramifications continued in the
Chestermere area.

Mayor Bill Porter said the panic over it was unnecessary, while Joan
Hetherington, a member of the Over the Hill community group, said living near
such developments was like living on a time bomb.

Said Porter: "From what I've been told, there was no threat to public safety."

Hetherington said: "This is another incident. And they continue to happen and we
keep being told 'No, no, no it won't.' It's like sitting in California waiting
for the Big One. You're sitting on a time bomb."

For Atlantic Energy, owners of one of the possible leak sites, owner Paul Wright
said: "It was a nuisance (odor) issue. There was never any threat to health or
public safety."

Hearing planned on gas pipeline proposals   Alberta Energy Minister hopes
information will   help market decide between competing projects

BYLINE: CATHRYN MOTHERWELL; GAM

LENGTH: 636 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


BY CATHRYN MOTHERWELL
Alberta Bureau
  CALGARY
 Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman stepped into a game of chicken
yesterday, but the two participants didn't so much as blink.

Mr. Orman announced that the provincial Energy Resources Conservation
Board will hold a hearing to collect information on plans by Altamont
Transmission Co. and Pacific Gas Transmission Co. to transport additional
Alberta natural gas to California.

Its report, expected by mid-spring, will not make any recommendations,
he said. An ERCB notice of hearing is expected in the next two weeks.

The minister made clear, however, that the government believes there is
a need for only one additional pipeline from Alberta to California. And he
hopes the hearing will help the market - producers, bankers, shippers and
buyers - decide which of the two it will be.

"My information is that the market is not strong enough for both
projects to go ahead," he said. He had suggested earlier the possibility
of a comparability hearing between the two projects, based on the benefits
the province could reap from each project.

However, he said the information hearing allows the government to avoid
making a choice, while providing additional information to the producing
community. "Governments should be very reluctant, in fact reticent, to
choose between pipeline projects."

Some movement in the producing and shipping communities is expected
before Nov. 1, the deadline by which shippers must provide letters of
credit to help finance the $15-million to $20-million cost of hooking each
pipeline up to the Nova Corp. transmission system. Calgary-based Nova is
to begin drawing down those letters of credit at the beginning of 1992.

"There is some suggestion that this process will result in suppliers on
one (pipeline) or the other saying 'I don't know if this game of chicken
can go any further if I've got to start and ante up that kind of money,' "
Mr. Orman said.

However, while officials representing the two projects said they will
participate in the hearing, they emphatically stated that in the meantime
it is business as usual.

For PGT, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric
Co., it means making final preparations to begin laying pipe alongside its
existing line through Washington and Oregon in January.

And for Houston-based Altamont, it means completing surveys through
Montana and Wyoming and having shippers apply for export and removal
permits.

"We're pleased that the decision allows us to proceed with our
scheduled plans," said PGT spokeswoman Martha Montfried.

Altamont president Ewell Muse said only one thing could stand in the
way of his pipeline's construction: a provincial decision to withhold
removal permits from Altamont shippers.

"If they're going to give us removal permits, we're going to go," Mr.
Muse said.

The Altamont and PGT projects, if built, could transport a maximum of
about 1.4 billion cubic feet a day of new natural gas into the California
market, which is expected to grow by 1.3 billion cubic feet by the end of
the decade.

However, Mr. Orman said he has not seen any evidence that California
can absorb the volume of gas that would come from Alberta and gas-
producing states in the U.S. Southwest.

The PGT pipeline expansion project would build a second 1,158-kilometre
pipeline beside its existing line. It would carry 755 million cubic feet
of natural gas a day, cost $1.7-billion and be in operation in November,
1993.

The Altamont project would build an entirely new line through Montana
and Wyoming, where it would hook up with the Kern River gas line into
Southern California. It would carry just over 700 million cubic feet of
natural gas, cost $573-million and is also scheduled to be operation in
November, 1993. Because it is a shorter line - only 990 kilometres - its
construction is not scheduled to start until the spring of 1993.

State seeks new energy strategies

Officials look for public input on initiatives affecting mineral industries,

What's next?

Three more public meetings are scheduled for today to discuss specific aspects
of the strategy's framework. The meetings will be hosted in Room B63 of the
Herschler Building. Links to live Web broadcasts of the meetings can also be
found at http://governor.wy.gov/Pages/energystrategy.aspx. The meetings are:

CHEYENNE - Wyoming is looking to develop new strategies to maximize the value of
its energy resources.

The governor's office hosted a meeting Thursday to explain and seek public input
on a statewide energy policy that is being developed.

Gov. Matt Mead instructed the state to begin developing the plan last year.

The purpose of the comprehensive strategy is for it to be used as a framework
that will lead to the implementation of specific initiatives.

"It is not a final plan because we want it to be sort of a working document
recognizing changes in laws, changes in technology (and) changes in mineral
prices," Mead said this week. "It is an attempt to be as proactive as possible
so we can maximize energy development, and do it in a way that is most
responsible."

More than 70 proposals to be incorporated into the strategy have been submitted
by the public, and energy and conservation representatives.

Thursday's meeting and additional ones scheduled for today are intended to
provide an overview of the work done so far and to solicit more public comments.

"What we are hoping to accomplish is give the public a better understanding of
the approach the governor, the staff and (other stakeholders) are taking in
accomplishing a balanced strategy for energy and the environment," said Shawn
Reese, who is Mead's policy director.

Reese explained the state has already developed several guiding principles and
strategic themes.

These include:

n

Industry competitiveness, expansion and diversification are fundamental to
maintaining and expanding Wyoming's economy.

n

A strong, balanced regulatory structure and taxation policy creates certainty of
expectations, efficiency in process and equality in application.

n

Creating the energy economy of tomorrow by investing in the development of
ideas, initiatives and individuals in the marketplace today.

n

Long-term natural resource conservation through science, planning, selection and
implementation of the right practices in the right place at the right time.

More of the specifics can be found on the governor's website at
http://governor.wy.gov/Pages/energystrategy.aspx.

The state is looking for the public to comment on the ideas in person, through
email or an online survey that is also on the website.

The public comment period will run until Dec. 14. Reese said the state could
announce the first round of specific proposals that will be part of the energy
strategy as early as the middle of January.

Examples of some of the suggested initiatives include establishing a stable and
consistent taxation system, using compressed natural gas as a vehicle fuel
source and creating incentives for development of non-core sage grouse habitats.

Reese said another key component of the strategy is maximizing the value of the
state's minerals.

"We believe there is more economic opportunity in adding value to our resources
here, rather than shipping the commodities out of state," he said. "Certainly
that is easier said than done, but it is nevertheless important, and there are a
lot of thing we can do in Wyoming and the (University of Wyoming) School of
Energy Resources."

Reese said the energy strategy will also help provide guidance for the state's
many agencies and sub-cabinet positions that deal with the industry.

"They will help define what operations they include in their individual
strategic plans, and it will help coordinate plans across agencies so they are
communicating together,"

he said. "I also think it eventually will help develop budget recommendations
that are grounded in this strategic framework."

EPA: TEXACO UNIT BROKE

HAZARDOUS WASTE RULES

NEW YORK - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it has filed an
administrative complaint against Texaco's Bakersfield oil refinery, charging
that the facility illegally disposed of hazardous waste by discharging
selenium-contaminated wastewater into an underground injection well on the site.

The EPA proposed a $ 391,000 penalty.

"Discharging hazardous waste into underground injection wells is expressly
forbidden by federal and state regulations," said Jeff Zelikson, the agency's
regional director of hazardous waste management. "We strictly enforce this to
protect groundwater."

The refinery is charged with three violations of the federal Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act and the California Health and Safety Code, which
govern management of hazardous waste.

The EPA is charging Texaco with failing to adequately determine whether the
waste was hazardous, disposing of a hazardous waste without a permit, and
disposing of hazardous waste that did not meet land disposal treatment
standards.  ORYX ENERGY CO.

ELIMINATING 300 JOBS DALLAS - Hit by slumping oil prices, Oryx Energy Co. plans
to cut 300 jobs - one-fifth of its work force - and sell some assets to reduce
its expenses at least $ 61 million a year.

The independent oil and gas company said Thursday it will slash its onshore
fields from 300 in 19 states to 150 fields in six states.

The company expects to take a charge for the down-sizing of about $ 103 million,
$ 71 million of which will come from estimated losses on the sale of assets.

"We are determined to have our cost structure be more in line with current
product prices. Therefore, we will, and must continue, to find ways to lower our
cost of doing business," Robert Hauptfuhrer, Oryx chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement.

Oryx expects to save $ 61 million in 1995 from the moves, nearly half in
operating costs. Production for 1995 is expected to drop by about 2 percent of
the 1994 level, the company said.

Third oil spill fuels calls for Alberta pipeline review

BYLINE: Nathan VanderKlippe, Carrie Tait

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; ENVIRONMENT; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 248 words

DATELINE: Calgary


Environmental critics are calling for a major review of pipeline safety in
Alberta after the province experienced a third large oil spill in a month.

About 230,000 litres of heavy crude oil spilled from a pumping station on an
Enbridge Inc. pipeline onto farmland, Alberta's oil and gas regulator, the
Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), said Tuesday.

The regulator said 1,450 barrels of oil spilled from a pumping station on
Enbridge's Athabasca pipeline, 24 kilometres from Elk Point, Alta. The spill
comes while crews are still working to clean up two other large leaks in
Alberta, nearly 800,000 litres of oil from a Pace Oil & Gas Ltd. well about 200
kilometres from the Northwest Territories border, and 160,000 to 480,000 litres
from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline that ruptured beneath the Red Deer
River.

"Given the significant number of pipeline spills in recent months, Alberta
should conduct a review of the integrity of Alberta's pipeline system," said
Simon Dyer, policy director with the Pembina Institute. "Pipeline spills are
inevitable but the risks can be reduced through stronger regulation and
practices."

The ERCB defended the province's rules. "Alberta has a fairly strong safety
record of pipeline safety regardless of the recent incidents," spokesman Darin
Barter said. "I couldn't speculate on whether the province should or shouldn't
call any sort of review of pipelines because I know our pipelines, at this
point, we consider to be adequate."

Internet of Things: Connected devices to save our resources

BYLINE:

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 580  words


Energy and resource conservation is one of the key areas we have the ability to
impact in order to reduce global carbon emissions.

While we have many sources of clean power generation technologies available to
us, the cheapest and the cleanest megawatt is the one that is never generated.

People have spent years educating consumers about reducing energy and resource
demand, from energy saving light bulbs to programmable thermostats to low flow
toilets - but it is now time to move on. These things are becoming standard -
the energy saving light bulb section is twice the size of the conventional light
bulb section at any hardware store, and toilets that aren't low flow (6 LPF) are
virtually impossible to buy now.

Moving on means finding new ways to reduce energy consumption. The idea of
owning efficient devices is continuing to take hold, but we haven't really
started to look at the way we operate and interconnect these devices. This is
where the 'Internet of Things' comes in.

The Internet of Things refers to uniquely identifiable objects having an
Internet presence. We're not just talking about your computer, laptop, cellphone
or even your TV here - we're talking about everything. This includes your light
switches, your fridge, even your toilet.

With an Internet presence, all of your devices can start talking to each other
and reacting to each other.

Imagine a house that detects that a toilet hasn't been flushed for two days. It
uses this to assume that the owners must be on vacation, but notices they left
their heat cranked up to 22°C, their TV running and all their lights on.

Automatically, it adjusts all of these to an appropriate state (that might have
pre-defined for being on vacation), and sends a text message, tweet or email to
let the owners know. A text from the owners in return, or a tweet with
#LightsOn, and the house will respond.

Currently automated irrigation systems (based on time alone) can now check the
weather forecast from your favourite weather website and decide to forego a
scheduled watering because of the rain that is about to start falling.

It's all being made possible by the ever declining cost of wireless
communications. Proprietary home automation systems have existed for a number of
years - but I'm talking about something that goes a whole lot further.

This is still an idea that is in the early days of being developed. A lot of
what is being done right now is by interested DIY (do-it-yourself) programmers
and hobbyists through sites such as ThingSpeak.com and Pachube.com. It's a world
of experimentation, twittering toilets, and home energy monitoring.

In time, these devices will be perfected, become interoperable, and commercially
available. Some of these devices will even start to be controlled by third
parties, such as utilities that may need to reduce demand temporarily by turning
everyone's thermostat down by 1 C in order to avoid having to bring an oil fired
power plant online.

The early stages of residential energy and resource conservation are focused on
equipment - the next phase is going to focus on operation.

Being energy wise on this completely new high-tech level could be something
completely revolutionary - the ability to correct for fallible human behaviour
and habits.

charity focusing on sustainable engineering education. If you'd like to support

Rikon closer to ASE listing

A Calgary company which manufactures and markets software vending machines moved
one step closer this week to being listed on the Alberta Stock Exchange.

Rikon Technologies Inc., a junior capital pool company, said it has signed a
letter of intent to acquire all shares of Rikon Corp. for an aggregate purchase
price of $ 4.5 million.

The agreement would qualify as Rikon Technologies' "major transaction." Rikon
Corp. said it had a deal with a private U.S. corporation for the purchase of its
PCVend kiosks. The agreement covers the purchase of 400 kiosks for about $ 8.4
million US.

Energy regulator has new logo

Alberta's energy regulator has a new face to go with its new name.

The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board revealed its new logo Tuesday and said it
will now go by the acronym of EUB. It replaces the ERCB, the long-standing
acronym of the former Energy Resources Conservation Board.

The ERCB was merged with the Public Utilities Board in February, forming the
EUB, which regulates Alberta's oil, oilsands, natural gas, pipelines, tolls,
electrical operations, power bills, transmission lines and coal mines.

The EUB ensures safe, orderly and efficient development of the petroleum
industry and power generation, plus ensuring just and reasonable rates for
electrical and gas utilities.

Kingsfield quits joint venture

Kingsfield Environmental Corp. and its 100-per-cent subsidiary, Technisol Inc.,
have sold out of a two-year-old joint venture with Canadian Waste Management
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Trimac Inc. of Calgary.

Together they owned Triwaste Technisol Inc., which owns a hazardous waste
processing facility in Raymond.

Kingsfield said Tuesday the facility had never met its projections and business
was declining, so it wants to concentrate on its automotive filter recycling and
solvent cleaning divisions.

Fox Energy to buy back shares

Fox Energy Corp. of Calgary plans to buy back up to 200,000 of its common shares
over the next year.

The company will buy the shares, through open market transactions, starting
Thursday. Shares of the junior oil and gas company are traded on the Alberta
Stock Exchange.

Canadian holds 25% of plant

An article which appeared in this column Thursday, Oct. 5, incorrectly reported
that Canadian Leader Energy Inc. holds a 15 per cent interest in the Kitto lake
gas plant project. Canadian's interest is actually 25 per cent.

CanadianOxy credit upgraded

The credit rating on Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd.'s $ 200 million in
short-term notes has been upgraded to A-1 from A-1 (Low) by Canadian Bond Rating
Service Inc.

CBRS said Tuesday its upgrade, which followed CanadianOxy's 1995 credit review,
reflects the strengthening liquidity position of the Calgary company.

The A (Low) rating on CanadianOxy's long-term debt was retained by CBRS, which
said its overall rating outlook for the company is positive, in anticipation of
further improvement in financial risk and a stronger credit standing.

Oilpatch trio amalgamates

Neutrino Resources Ltd., Red Oak Resources Inc. and Maxon Energy Inc. have
joined forces after the companies received shareholders' approval to amalgamate.

The new company with more than 1,500 barrels per day of production will carry
the name Neutrino Resources Inc. and trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under
the symbol NTO starting Oct. 17.

Allyn Resources makes deal

Allyn Resources Inc. of Tobaccoville, N.C., and Calgary has cut a deal to earn a
50-per-cent interest in a 2,500-acre base metals mining property about 225
kilometres northwest of Yellowknife, N.W.T.

Allyn, whose shares trade on the Alberta Stock Exchange, has bought the prospect
from Aber Resources Ltd. of Vancouver and Covello, Bryan & Assoc. of
Yellowknife.

Allyn has pledged to spend $ 25,000 drilling some shallow wells on the DeVries
Lake property in 1995 and another $ 975,000 by the end of 1999, earning a 50 per
cent interest in the lands, the company said Tuesday. The lands indicate the
presence of copper, cobalt and possibly gold, said Allyn.

Orbit rejects Gulf takeover bid

Orbit Oil & Gas Ltd. has rejected Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s $ 72-million
takeover bid, saying it's inadequate and does not reflect the full value of its
assets.

Orbit says Gulf's offer of $ 1.10 a share amounts to about $ 4 per barrel of oil
equivalent, which is below the $ 6 average paid recently in other takeovers.

A Gulf spokesman said little about the rejection Tuesday, noting that the bid is
the highest to date and is there for shareholders to evaluate.

Gulf is also offering $ 1.40 cash for all the shares of Orbit's sister company
Czar Resources Ltd., making the entire deal worth about $ 193 million. The bids
are open until the third week of October.

School board deal with drilling firm under scrutiny; Regulator urged to probe
secrecy around 'sour' wells

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 485  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


A lawyer for a group of Alberta residents opposing the drilling of hydrogen
sulphide wells near a school wants the oilpatch regulator to probe a
confidential deal between the oil company and school board.

Keith Wilson, who represents parents of children who attend the elementary
school in Tomahawk, 130 kilometres southwest of Edmonton, said his clients have
a right to know details of an agreement that resulted in the Parkland County
School Division dropping its objections to the wells.

"It is our view that the school board has breached its obligations to protect
the children by entering into a secret deal and by failing to intervene in these
related proceedings," Wilson wrote in a letter to the Energy Resources
Conservation Board that was copied to the energy minister and several other
MLAs, lawyers and officials.

Refusing to disclose the agreement makes it impossible for parents or the Energy
Resources Conservation Board to assess whether the students will be adequately
protected, he said.

Parents of the 130 children who attend the school, west of Tomahawk, are upset
they were denied standing at the upcoming approval hearing on the basis that the
school board would represent their concerns.

They fear the "sour" wells, which are expected to have 16 per cent
concentrations of hydrogen sulphide and are proposed to be drilled within two
kilometres of the school, will put their children in peril.

Wilson said it is "outrageous" that a deal to permit the wells can be kept
confidential from the parents.

He said his clients want to know if money changed hands in the deal -- an
allegation the company, Highpine Oil and Gas Ltd., vehemently denied Thursday.

"I am aware of the letter this particular gentleman has submitted to the ERCB
and as an officer of a publicly traded company, I am appalled and offended,"
said David Humphreys, the company's vice-president of operations. "It's
preposterous to assume we paid off a school board.

"No money changed hands and, in fact, if they wanted to know the terms of this
negotiation they would realize it was purely safety and timing related."

He added that it's normal practice for a deal between a landowner and the
company to be kept confidential.

Officials from the school board couldn't be reached for comment.

But ERCB spokesman Darren Barter said the company must ensure the safety of the
students regardless of what was agreed to by the two parties.

"The regulations can't be compromised," he said. "People need to understand that
our standards for public safety will not change."

Wilson's 13-page letter to the ERCB also accused the energy board of breaching
rules of procedural fairness set out by the Alberta Court of Appeal. It accused
the board of deciding "in secret" who gets standing at the hearings that begin
Tuesday in Tomahawk, and of failing to provide adequate disclosure of the
proposals and communications between the company and the board.

Oil patch can't ignore environment

BYLINE: Robert Page

LENGTH: 223 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


I was most pleasantly surprised to read Laurie Ludwick's Alberta Report, Lessons
on Whaleback (Sept. 14). It is most encouraging to finally read some serious
analysis of the environmental issues facing the oil and gas industry and its
influence on the regulatory climate.

In response to public pressure, the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the
National Energy Board have both given clear signals of the changing regulatory
climate. Also, the province is working on its own strategy of protected lands
under ''Special Places 2000.'' Many oil companies are no longer bidding on lands
under consideration because of the risk of losing their investment. Amoco Canada
Petroleum Co. Ltd. chose to ignore this.

There have been great strides in environmentally appropriate technology and
procedures but the levels of environmental management vary greatly within the
oil patch. Also, there have been some imaginative efforts at interactive public
consultation such as used by Rigel Energy Corp.

If there is shock in some oil companies from the ERCB decision on Whaleback, it
is only due to their failure to monitor properly the changing principles and
practices within their industry on environmental management.

Over the years, as Government grew more complicated, names of Federal agencies
were abbreviated - ACDA, BuPers, C.I.A., DoD, E.E.O.C., FERC and on through the
alphabet to VISTA and YCC. Federal laws, meanwhile, retaining a vestigial human
touch, were known by the names of their sponsors - Smoot-Hawley,
McCarran-Walter, Landrum-Griffin. But increasingly, laws too have become
acronyms.

What in 1966 was the Freedom of Information Act is now frequently called FOIA,
rhymes with Goya. The historic legislation enacted in 1970 after Earth Day is
NEPA, the National Environmental Protection Act. In 1974 came ERISA, the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and in 1976 RECRA, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. For all the months of fierce struggle required to
pass it in 1978, President Carter's gas-decontrol bill is called, bloodlessly,
NGPA (Natural Gas Policy Act).

There was a throwback to the older pattern in 1981. President Reagan's dramatic
supply-side tax cut was named for its sponsors, Kemp-Roth. A tax cut,
presumably, is something politicians wish to be identified with. But
abbreviation quickly reasserted itself when Congress decided to raise taxes.

Towns tidy up for judges

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 379  words


JUDGING has started for the Ergon Energy Tidy Towns awards.

Keep Australia Beautiful judges will be in Charters Towers today and the
Dalrymple Shire until Tuesday.

This year 24 towns from 10 North Queensland council regions have entered the
competition including Charters Towers, Ravenswood, Pentland, Homestead and
Greenvale from this area.

Keep Australia Beautiful Queensland CEO Kylie Johnston said 191 towns have
entered in total, all vying for the title of Queensland's tidiest town.

''This year marks Keep Australia Beautiful Queensland's 35th birthday as well as
the the 35th anniversary of the Tidy Towns competition,'' she said.

''Tidy Towns is all about rewarding sustainable communities -- our awards
recognise outstanding achievement in categories ranging from resource
conservation and waste management through to protection of the environment.''

Keep Australia Beautiful's mission is to motivate people to care for their local
environment.

Ms Johnston said to take out the Tidiest Town title, a community must best
exemplify all aspects of the Ergon Energy Tidy Towns competition criteria.

Judges take into account a community's geographic environmental and economic
circumstances and assess how efficiently and effectively the community uses the
resources available to it against a range of criteria including tidiness and
litter abatement, visitor friendliness, cultural heritage and environmental
protection initiatives.

George and Kathleen Williams are the North Queensland judges and will be looking
for winners in the following categories: Tourism Queensland friendly town award,
Australia Post bush spirit award, RACQ litter prevention award, Australian Food
and Grocery Council resource conservation and waste management award, Smorgon
Steel recycling community -- local government partnership award, protection of
the environment award, young legends award, Outdoor Media Association cultural
heritage award, environmental innovation award, Thiess Services community action
award, MINT individual outstanding accomplishment award and of course the Ergon
Energy tidiest town title.

Entrants will compete firstly against the communities in their Tidy Towns
region, with the regional winners then competing at a State level.

Winners are expected to be announced in July.

Rockies drilling gets go-ahead

BYLINE: MONTE STEWART

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E1

ERCB rules project is in public interest; coalition plans appeal

The Energy Resources Conservation Board approved Friday Husky Oil Ltd.'s
application to drill five test wells on a potentially large oil find inside
Kananaskis Country.

Drilling on Moose Mountain will start in two weeks, but environmentalists vow to
continue the fight against oil and gas development on the eastern slopes of the
Rocky Mountains.

In a decision which will likely set industry ground rules for environmental
impact assessments, the ERCB decided that Husky's application to drill five
wells on a 15-hectare site is in the public interest. The $ 25-million project
is expected to last nine months and displace 15 hectares on a 6,400-hectare
drilling lease jointly held by Husky and Rigel Energy Corp.

"We're very happy about it," said Dawn Mitchell, Husky's corporate
communications manager

Meanwhile, Rocky Mountain Ecosystem Coalition executive director Mike Sawyer
said his group plans to appeal the decision in Provincial Court. He argued that
the ERCB refused the group's request to subpoena Alberta Fish and Wildlife
officials to public meetings in January and, therefore, violated the fundamental
principle of cross-examination of facts.

"I'm in this battle to stay until I win or they put me in the ground," Sawyer
said.

Sawyer had a bigger beef with the ERCB than Husky after the board refused the
coalition's request to grant a moratorium on all leasing and development inside
Kananaskis Country. He noted that the ERCB routinely rejects appeals on drilling
projects and he had to fight just to get a hearing.

"It's a bogus system," said Sawyer.

Mitchell said Husky will continue to consult with environmentalists as the
project proceeds.

In a 26-page decision, the ERCB said it:

* believes that the re-injection of produced fluids (a novel well-testing
procedure proposed by Husky) is technically sound and "has the potential" to
reduce environmental impacts caused by flaring of gas or trucking of fluids.

* considers that the environmental information provided by Husky was appropriate
for an early stage of the project.

* believes to a large degree that Husky has met the requirements for public
consultation although it expects Husky to establish ongoing consultation with
the Tsuu T'ina Nation.

* believes that, if the site is commercially viable, the development will have
an unknown impact on local wildlife habitat and populations and these impacts
should be addressed once the value of the energy resource is known.

* supports the interveners' position that ongoing broad-range planning is needed
to ensure human activities don't have an unacceptable environmental impact.

"If they don't know what the impacts are, they can't possibly make a decision
it's in the best interests of Albertans," said Sawyer.

A discovery well was drilled last winter and an abbreviated production test
yielded up to 800 barrels of oil per day. But Mitchell said Husky has "no idea"
how large the reserve could be.

ENVIRONMENTAL TAB $ 25 MILLION

Amoco expects high costs in huge Hunter Creek project

Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. will spend an extra $ 25 million to limit the
environmental damage of developing a potentially massive natural gas field in
southwest Alberta.

"It's a more expensive way to go. It's a situation where surface impact has to
be contained," Rick Brown, Amoco's senior vice-president of exploration, said
Thursday.

All the pros and cons of the project, including the potential economic impact,
must be considered, Brown told a Calgary conference of the Petroleum Joint
Venture Association.

With a potential reserve of 1.2 trillion cubic feet of sour gas, Hunter Creek
could create 1,500 jobs to the year 2014.

It could boost Alberta's gross domestic product by $ 10.2 billion, which
represents more than $ 275 million, or 15 per cent, of the average annual
increase in gross domestic product in Alberta in recent years, Brown said.

"In the first 20 years alone, personal income in the province would rise by more
than $ 5 billion, or about $ 225 million annually - equivalent to $ 800 per year
for every person in the province," he said.

Direct payments of royalties and leases to the province would be $ 900 million.
Total payments, including taxes from spinoff jobs, would pump $ 2 billion into
provincial coffers, Brown said.

However, these are only projections based on unknown potential. Amoco may do
nothing more than drill some unsuccessful wildcat wells, if its exploration
plans are approved by the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board.

Amoco has bought 61 sections of unproven land to explore in the Hunter Creek
region, about 120 kilometres southwest of Calgary. The American-controlled
company wants to drill its first exploration hole this summer.

Amoco has held about 30 meetings with residents and local officials around
Maycroft, the site of the ERCB hearing that begins April 25.

Amoco plans to drill 20 directional wells from five drilling sites or pads,
which will boost the cost by $ 25 million over the traditional practice of one
hole per site.

Some environmental groups say the project will hurt the elk population and
habitat.

Meanwhile, James Tweedie, an environmentalist who lives within eight kilometres
of Amoco's proposed well, lost a legal bid Thursday to contest the ERCB's
decision to not give him "intervener" funding. The funding would have been used
to prepare Tweedie's case for the hearing.

In the Alberta Court of Appeal this week, Tweedie's lawyer, Harvey Locke, argued
for leave to appeal the board's decision. But the judge denied the request.

Tweedie, a member of the Whaleback Coalition, lives within Amoco's emergency
planning zone. People within the zone are evacuated if there's an emergency such
as a sour gas leak.

Canada, U.S. lag behind in energy conservation

BYLINE: Canadian Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 196 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  The U.S. and Canada lag behind most other industrialized countries in energy
conservation, a report published on the weekend said.

Of the world's 10 largest economies, in descending order of efficiency, the
U.S., Canada, China and India, trail the list. On top are France, Japan, Italy,
West Germany, Brazil and Britain.

Together with the 23 other developed countries that make up the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development, the U.S. made big overall gains in energy
efficiency from the first oil embargo in 1973 through 1986. That trend has been
reversed in the last two years, it said.

The report, titled World Resources 1988-89, was prepared jointly by the World
Resources Institute, a Washington research centre, and the International
Institute for Environment & Development, based in London.

The report said from 1970 to 1986 the U.S. gained 33% in energy used per dollar
of gross national product.

Japan ranked second with a 32% gain. Canada and France gained 28%; West Germany,
23%; Britain, 19%; Italy, 15% and Brazil, 6%.

For the OECD as a whole, the improvement in energy efficiency was 20% from 1970
to 1986.

Economic priorities outlined

BYLINE: Rick Longley, Orland Press Register, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 630 words


Apr. 9--Orland's economic development strategies are set to go to the City
Council for its input and approval.

The city's Economic Development Commission this week broke potential projects
into three sections in the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies.

Its recommendations will go to the council later this month or in early May for
review and additional information, according to EDC Secretary Janet Wackerman.

Priority A listings are things the commission believes should be developed this
year, including finding funding to remodel the old Purity Market building into
Orland's Public Safety Facility.

Architectural plans are done for the new station that would go in across the
street from City Hall at the corner of Fourth and Mill streets.

However, the city does not have money to build at this point and is seeking
state or federal funding to complete it should those dollars become available,
city officials say.

Under Priority A, commissioners also suggest the city continue pursuing business
development opportunities that focus on agriculture and natural resources in the
area in both industry and tourism.

Commissioner Mike Yalow said partnerships with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Glenn County Resource Conservation District and Central Sacramento
Valley Resource Conservation and Development District should be continued. He
added joining forces with Butte Community College and the Glenn County Office of
Education also can assist local residents with employment and educational
opportunities.

Expanding fiber optics and Broadband access within the county is another segment
of Priority A that needs to be worked on this year.

Commission Chairman Gary Campbell said better Internet capabilities are
essential to attracting high-tech companies to Orland.

The city also can support creation of bio-energy projects within the county
where solid waste and green waste is recycled into gas or electric energy,
commissioners said. The Baker Project east of Orland is trying to develop such
an enterprise in cooperation with Glenn County.

Continued development of an economic strategic plan and finding grants for the
Stony Creek Park project are on the Priority A list as well.

Priority B items are projects that could be done in the next five years.

They include putting a historic district designation within the city's general
plan to be updated again in five years.

City Manager Paul Poczobut Jr. said a section of downtown Orland has been
"identified" as a historic district, but the city does not have the money to
have it designated historic within the current general plan update.

The state requires additional studies and paperwork to obtain historic district
status within the planning document, he said.

Building a community center and developing a Stony Creek Trail near the proposed
park also could be tackled in the next five years, the commission said.

Under Priority C, the extension of Pabst Avenue to the north including the
undergrounding of Lateral 40 could be done in 10 years along with expanding the
Orland Library building.

Some of these projects also may be narrowed down to fit regional funding
requests since a consultant for the city, 3CORE in Chico, suggests regional
projects have more chance of gaining state or federal dollars, commissioners
said.

NDP eyes regulator split; Notley to order review of province's oilpatch
oversight

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Calgary Herald

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 686 words


The NDP government will review the "conflicting mandate" of the province's
oilpatch watchdog with a view to separating its responsibility to both promote
and police energy development, says Premier Rachel Notley.

"One of the concerns that I have always had with the Alberta Energy Regulator is
that it appears to have a conflicting mandate, in that it is both a promoter of
energy and the primary vehicle of environmental protection in Alberta," Notley
said in an interview.

"What's troubling about the AER is it has actually taken over responsibility for
most of the environmental protection and monitoring part and standards
development within the energy sector ... You can't do that job when your
overarching mandate is to promote energy development."

Notley said Friday she thinks those mandates have to be "split."

The premier's comments come as the new NDP government is in the midst of several
major policy initiatives affecting the province's energy sector, including a
review of royalty rates, a new climate change strategy, higher corporate taxes
and a promise to ban natural gas drilling in urban areas.

The Progressive Conservatives established the AER in December 2012 to provide
one-stop shopping for regulatory approvals after industry complained about the
delays and costs of red tape.

The legislation combined duties of the Energy Resources Conservation Board with
responsibilities of Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to
create a single entity to administer the Public Lands Act, the Environmental
Protection and Enhancement Act and the Water Act.

Notley said notwithstanding that there are "good people" working on the
environmental files, the agency needs a mandate that "allows for a clear plan of
action in every situation."

In the past, she has been harshly critical of the PC government's decision to
appoint former oilpatch executive Gerry Protti to head the AER. Notley said two
years ago she was appalled at the appointment of an industry insider to head the
agency.

Response to her suggestion to split the AER was mixed Monday.

Gary Leach, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada,
rejected the contention the AER promotes energy development.

"The AER is looked to by many jurisdictions in North America and around the
world as a leading regulator for energy projects," Leach said in an email.

"The primary role of the AER ... is focused on environmental protection, public
safety and resource conservation - not the promotion of energy development."

Leach said the AER has taken on some regulatory functions formerly residing at
other government departments to facilitate full life cycle oversight of energy
projects "from conception through operations to final decommissioning and
reclamation."

"We think this provides better and closer oversight of energy projects in
Alberta with a view to protecting the public interest."

But Bill Andrew, CEO of Long Run Exploration, said there will be support within
the oilpatch for splitting up AER's functions because the current regulator has
too much on its plate.

"The system works very well but ... when I was younger, I felt there was a much
more hands-on ERCB and they would interact with you a hell of a lot more and try
to really steer you forcibly in the right path," said the industry veteran.

Mike Hudema, Greenpeace energy campaigner, said the AER has "long been a broken
agency" that has failed in its duty to protect Alberta's environment and
communities.

"We commend the premier for being willing to look at its mandate and hopefully
reform this body into one that can instil trust, provide transparency and ensure
the safety of our environment and communities," Hudema said in an email.

"It won't be an easy fix, but is a necessary one."

But Wildrose energy critic Leela Aheer said it would be "a huge mistake" to chop
up the AER when it is just getting over "serious growing pains."

"This will seriously promote instability in the sector," said the
Chestermere-Rocky View MLA.

A 2-year-old was bitten on the ankle by a rattlesnake about 1:40 p.m. Monday at
the trailhead to the South Mesa Trail in Eldorado Springs, according to the
Boulder County Sheriff's Office.

A park ranger helped the child and father to the trailhead parking lot.
Paramedics initiated treatment at the scene and took the child to Boulder
Community Hospital. The child was airlifted to The Children's Hospital in Denver
a short time later.

The child's name and condition were not released.

Boulder   Shurin breaks hula-hoop record

Boulder resident Betty "Hoops" Shurin says she has unofficially broken her own
Guinness World Record for hula-hooping for 10 straight kilometers.

Shurin set the record in the 2005 Bolder Boulder with a time of 1 hour, 43
minutes and 11 seconds. She says she broke the record last year, but her
camera-person fell, breaking the camera and shattering hopes of proving the feat
to the people at Guinness. This year, she thinks she finished in between 1:30
and 1:35, but was unable to access her time on the Bolder Boulder Web site as of
Monday afternoon.

Shurin said she had hula-hooped for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation of her
hometown of Westchester, N.Y.

Hoops, who runs Betty Hoops Dance Therapy, said of the achievement, "I'm brain
dead and it feels like I've been punched in the gut."

PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. and Alberta Energy Co. said they intend to build a
natural gas liquids straddle plant near Empress, in southeast Alberta. A
straddle plant sits atop a natural gas pipeline, extracts liquids from the gas
and then returns the gas to the pipeline. The plant is expected to cost between
$50 million and $70 million and PanCanadian and AEC will each hold an equal
interest. The two Calgary-based companies are seeking other partners though they
will maintain a controlling interest. The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation
Board has granted conditional approval and construction is expected to begin
later this year. Capacity will be 800 million cubic feet per day.

Alberta energy board calls for consultation

BYLINE: CP

LENGTH: 249 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


Canadian Press
  CALGARY
    Alberta conservationists and landowners have won a victory in their
crusade to control the spread of energy production plants.

In a rare decision to reject a development application, the provincial
Energy Resources Conservation Board served notice that petroleum companies
must seek public consent to their projects.

The board sided with dissenting environmentalists and property owners
to turn down an application by Unocal Canada Ltd. for construction of a
new natural gas processing plant.

The decision comes in the midst of escalating conflicts over major
petroleum industry projects, such as the $700-million gas, sulphur and
chemicals development at Caroline, 120 kilometres northwest of Calgary.

In handing down the ruling the energy board warned the industry that
economic issues, including profits and royalties, are no longer the only
deciding factors for projects.

The Unocal ruling centred on a proposal in the Beaverlodge area of
northwestern Alberta, but the board made it plain it wants higher
standards followed in planning developments throughout the province.

'With a large portion of the province's economic base dependent on the  oil and
gas industry, good relations between that industry and the public  are
es-sential,' it said.

'Proper public consultation is a critical component to site selection  for new
facilities and measures should be taken so that the public's  concerns are
considered and respected, and any potential impact is  minimized.'

Auckland power supply improves: Utility plans to pay businesses to conserve
electricity in downtown sector of New Zealand's largest city.

BYLINE: SUN NEWS SERVICES

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D3

LENGTH: 476 words

DATELINE: AUCKLAND


Electricity supplies to New Zealand's largest city improved Monday when
generators on a cargo ship and a repaired main cable both came on line, but
supply remained delicate, officials said.

Municipal utility Mercury Energy said it has the capacity to provide about 90
per cent of normal supply, but warned that power conservation was still crucial.

Demand in the affected central business district on an average summer's day was
about 150 megawatts, hitting a maximum of 180 on an unusually hot day when
people turned up air-conditioning units, Mercury said.

"Of the 150 to 180 megawatts, we are now supplying about 145 megawatts, so we
are close when you take into account conservation, but there is absolutely no
backup," said Patrick Strange, Mercury's general manager for future planning.

Until Feb. 20, when the last of four main cables into the city centre cut out
after an unprecedented sequence of failures, Mercury could supply up to 280
megawatts.

Strange told a news conference that the load has been slowly building as people
come back into the city. "So we are on the edge, but the supply situation has
certainly vastly improved." He also said Mercury plans to pay businesses to
conserve electricity, a proposal that may cost the company up to $ 2 million NZ
($ 1.7 million Cdn) a week.

"It could be double that," Strange said in announcing the plan which involves
paying all customers who cut power by more than 15 per cent of what they were
using before the crisis.

"If we pay one million [New Zealand dollars] a week, we will be happy. We will
be getting good savings," Strange said.

Mercury said the containership Union Rotorua started providing 12 megawatts of
power Monday, while the restored cable meant there were now two gas-insulated
power lines serving the central city.

The first of this pair of subterranean cables was repaired March 4. However,
both are being run at about a third of their usual capacity because of fears
they might fail if overloaded.

Auckland Mayor Les Mills said he would outline a proposal to conserve power in a
meeting with the city's big businesses, who among them employ about 20,000 to
30,000 people in the affected zone.

"If none of the news turns sour on us, the supply side is looking reasonable,"
he told the news conference.

"The demand side, however, has to be managed. The corporates cannot come back
unless they agree tonight to manage the demand side."

Mills said corporates would need to forgo about 30 to 40 per cent of normal
consumption, which would mean turning off air-conditioning, limiting the number
of elevators operating, turning off lights and retaining standby generators.

The return of big business to the city centre is crucial for the small
businesses in the area, which have lost turnover without their usual office
worker clientele.

Texas Nuclear Site

To the Editor:

You report (news item, Oct. 23) that the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission denied a license to store low-level nuclear waste at Sierra Blanca.
Although Gov. George W. Bush said science was the determining factor, the
decision was no doubt influenced by pressure from people who live nearby.

Sierra Blanca was the fourth site considered by Texas since it began searching
for a nuclear waste site in the early 1980's. Each time one
is defeated, another is named. It seems too much money is at stake for Texas
politicians to accept that burying atomic poisons is simply a bad idea.

Energy board pledges faster approvals of new technology

BYLINE: Dave Cooper, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E3

LENGTH: 387  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) announced Tuesday it will speed
up approvals of new and innovative technologies, and should end the long waits
some producers have faced.

"This is part of Alberta's competitiveness review, and one of a number of
initiatives. But this one is about technology, an important area that everyone
understands," spokesman Darin Barter said.

Under the new arrangements, the ERCB will appoint a chief operations engineer,
who will be the single contact for external contacts and proponents of
innovative technology.

This engineer will bring the proposals directly to the highest levels of the
ERCB for review and will also start the process of bringing in outside experts.

"The pace of technology is moving very rapidly, faster than ever before," Barter
said. "We have been here for 74 years, and our ability to change has always been
the hallmark of this organization. We have to find ways to keep ahead or find
ways to anticipate that change."

Currently, new proposals wend their way through the ERCB organization. Two
important projects -- Petrobank's Dawson fireflooding proposal near High Prairie
and a new Cenovus "wedge" well proposal for in situ oilsands -- have experienced
long delays for approval.

Dawson was finally approved two weeks ago, 19 months after Petrobank submitted
its application.

Petrobank vice-president Chris Bloomer has been publicly critical of the long
delays, contrasting the ERCB to his experience in Saskatchewan, where the
Kerrobert project was approved in less than three months.

"In those cases we think our new framework for technology would have expedited
the process. The outcome would have been the same and public safety would not be
compromised," Barter said.

He added technology exists in Alberta that the ERCB wants to see used in
upstream oil and gas.

"If this makes things better in this province, we want to do that."

In addition to the new chief operations engineer, the ERCB intends to develop a
process to "review, identify and mitigate risks as they relate to public safety,
environmental standards and resource conservation."

The board will also advise industry and government researchers on how new
technology may impact ERCB regulations, and will review its own rules to
encourage responsible innovation in technology.

Sour oil drilling worries Rocky Rapids residents; EUB's assurances fail to allay
concerns about possible future leaks

BYLINE: Hanneke Brooymans, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: ALBERTA; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 492  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


EDMONTON - People living in an area that's seen increasing sour gas activity
don't share the Energy Resources Conservation Board's confidence that their
safety is looked after, says the lawyer of a citizens group.

The board this week released a decision made by its predecessor, the Alberta
Energy and Utilities Board, on an application by Highpine Oil and Gas to drill
two sour oil wells 6.5 kilometres northeast of Rocky Rapids. Sour oil contains
hydrogen sulphide, a poisonous gas.

The board panel approved the application with a number of conditions. Highpine
president Jonathan Lexier said he hadn't had a chance to read the decision and
declined comment.

Jennifer Klimek, who represented the Rocky Rapids Concerned Citizens group
during last year's hearings on the application, said her clients have concerns
which were not addressed especially since the area near Drayton Valley is a zone
of concentration for sour oil exploration.

"The EUB operates under the premise of absolutely nothing will happen and if
something happens, people will be evacuated. They are confident, I guess, on
both of those fronts. The citizens aren't."

It's not just the drilling process area resident worry about, she said. They
also have concerns about the ongoing production of these wells, which could be
there for many years. Klimek said those worries were not addressed during the
hearing or in the decision.

Darin Barter, a board spokesman, said ongoing sour gas operations are managed by
the public safety and sour gas regulations. Field staff conduct inspections on
sour gas and oil facilities annually, he said.

"Sour operations are very well regulated, very strictly regulated and controlled
and inspected in this province."

These precautions aren't fail-safe, though, Klimek said.

"If you talk to the residents, they would say their No. 1 concern is production.
There's nobody around. They've had problems in Drayton Valley. They walk out and
they smell something. They don't know where it's coming from, they don't know
where to go."

Klimek recalled an incident in January 2007 when the EUB spent three days trying
unsuccessfully to track down the source of a sour gas leak after receiving 49
complaints from Drayton Valley area residents who could smell the rotten-egg
odour.

"The EUB was never able to determine where that leak came from," she said.

FEW COMPLAINTS

There will no longer be an animal health investigator who looks into landowner
complaints about potential animal health issues involving the oilpatch, the
Energy Resources Conservation Board announced Thursday.

The job was not effective, partly because of of the low number of complaints
received.

Since its inception in 1995, the animal health investigator was involved in 19
investigations, six of which could be directly attributed to petroleum
operations, the board said.

The board is now advising property owners and companies to consult veterinarians
if concerns arise.

Ministry Plans Bill to Safeguard Environment

BYLINE: Yochuku Ofoka Yobolisa

LENGTH: 600  words

DATELINE: Abuja


Ministry of Environment (FMOE) has announced plans to push a bill in parliament
to effectively manage and sustain the country's environmental space.

According to the ministry's Permanent Secretary, Alhaji Mohammed Sambo Bashar,
FMOE has also put in place adequate institutional and legal framework to
actualize environmental goals for the country for sustainable national
development through effective management of forest resources.

Alhaji Bashar made the revelation at the National Parks Service in Abuja while
speaking on the need for proper inculcation of environment-friendly habits and
lifestyles by the populace.

He said, "In view of the various benefits of forests and in pursuance of the
ministry's commitment to a safe environment and effective conservation and
preservation and sustainable management of the forests, government has put in
place a number of policies namely, national erosion and flood control policy,
national forest policy and national drought and desertification policy.

"In addition, a holistic national environmental management bill is being
prepared by the ministry in collaboration with relevant stakeholders for
effective and sustainable management of the environment.

Bashar said the ministry is also supporting sustainable forest management
through wildlife endangered/aquatic resources conservation and management,
forest resource development and management, conservation and development of
coastal ecosystem, ex-situ conservation of endangered indigenous species,
national resources conservation and development of management plans, forest
resources development and management, special programme on food security,
forests and climate change, forestry and bio-fuels for development of renewable
energy in general and wood energy in particular, watershed management and
national tree planting campaign.

The Permanent Secretary who spoke in place of Minister of the Environment,
described this year's theme, "Forests: Nature at Your Service" as very apt
because of its ability to address the various environmental challenges faced by
the remaining land species.

He said, "The theme for this year's World Environmental Day could not have come
at a better time than this when the world is facing a lot of environmental
challenges ranging from global warming, floods, landslides, and erosion and so
on".

The Perm Sec, however, lamented that owing to human-induced degradation, about
50 per cent of the world forest area had been depleted within the last 25 years,
adding that this year's WED was principally to showcase some of the goods and
services that could be derived from the nation's forests and also, to provide
the opportunity for Nigerians to exhibit and promote forestry best-practices for
sustainable management and socio-economic development.

He said that in order to realize government's commitment to environmental
sustainability as contained in the Goal 7 of the MDGs the ministry adopted
participatory and community-based forestry management approaches by involving
all stakeholders in the sustainable management of our forest resources.

Earlier, United Nations Development Programme, UNDP's country representative, Mr
Daouda Toure said that if Nigeria was to meet its aspiration of a smooth
transition into a sustainable green economy, urgently mitigate deforestation of
the country's forest areas to check species extinctions and greenhouse gas
emissions.

"Evidently, the threats facing our forests in Nigeria are extensive and requires
urgent measures if the country is to meet its aspiration of a smooth transition
into a sustainable green economy", he said.

NOVA PIPELINE APPROVED

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 491 words


Alberta energy exporters took a big step Tuesday towards completing a natural
gas sales package forecast to earn $ 27 billion over the next two decades.

Just in time to keep hope of meeting construction schedules alive, the
province's Energy Resources Conservation Board approved the final piece of the
California pipeline megaproject.

The ERCB, rejecting protests during hearings in Calgary last month, approved $
120 million worth of additions to Nova Corp.'s gas-gathering pipelines.

By letting Nova add capacity to fill the line, the ruling completes a route
stretching from southern Alberta across southeastern B.C., Idaho, Washington,
Oregon and California to Los Angeles.

The decision triggers a chain reaction of construction work to make deliveries
start Nov. 1.

Nova pipeline chief Bruce Simpson said there is still a good chance of meeting
that target, although protests before the ERCB threw the schedule off by making
the board miss an end-of-February deadline for the final approval.

Alberta Natural Gas Co. and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. of Calgary plan a spring
start on $ 224 million worth of construction. On the U.S. side, Pacific Gas
Transmission Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of San Francisco are building $
1.6 billion US in capacity additions.

The package adds up to a 75 per cent, 900-million-cubic-feet-a-day jump in gas
exports to the northwestern U.S. as well as California. Pacific Gas has also
launched planning for more new service to the northwestern states, where
population and energy demand are rising.

A Calgary economics consultant, Wright Mansell Research Ltd., forecasts the new
facilities will generate export revenues of about $ 1.3 billion a year, with
most flowing into Alberta as the main source of gas supplies.

About 80 per cent of the new exports are aimed at California - and it will need
the gas, a state official told an industry conference Tuesday held by the
Canadian Energy Research Institute.

Richard Bilas, a member of the Sacramento-based California Energy Commission,
said it is relying on gas imports from Canada to more than double over the next
20 years as the state's population continues to mushroom to 43 million from the
current 30 million.

Bilas said his state planning agency expects needs for Canadian gas to reach 2.2
billion cubic feet a day by 2010 - and possibly more, if trends such as
automotive fuel switching accelerate in response to environmental concerns.

He also promised to go to bat for Alberta exporters in their dispute over prices
and contracts with the California Public Utilities Commission. He made the
pledge after a 90-minute private meeting with Alberta Energy Minister Patricia
Black.

But Bilas acknowledged he has had little luck delivering on such pledges during
the threeyear feud between the CPUC and the province. His planning agency can
make appeals but cannot give orders to the utilities commission.

East Bay scouts, biology students team up to remove invasive thistle

MARTINEZ --Brian Wong, a 17-year-old junior at Alhambra High School and an Eagle
Scout with Boy Scout Troop 282 in Martinez, brought together classmates and
troop mates in an effort to better the environment -- a "Hornaday" project to
remove Italian thistle plans from Mount Wanda.

A Hornaday Project is one aimed at contributing significantly to natural
resource conservation and environmental protection. Named after him, the William
T. Hornaday Award was begun in 1914 by Dr. William Temple Hornaday, director of
the New York Zoological Park and founder of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Hornaday was an active and outspoken champion of natural resource
conservation and a leader in saving the American bison from extinction.

The Boy Scouts of America say to think of the Hornaday Awards as "An Olympic
Medal bestowed by the Earth." They are highly prized by those who have received
them: Approximately 1,100 medals have been awarded over the past 80 years. Brian
hopes to earn a Hornaday award with this project.

These awards represent a substantial commitment of time and energy by
individuals who have learned the meaning of a conservation/environmental ethic.
The projects to earn the awards must be from one of eight categories -- energy
conservation, soil and water conservation, fish and wildlife management,
forestry and range management, air and water pollution control, resource
recovery (recycling), hazardous material disposal and management and invasive
species control.

Brian pursued invasive species control, and led his combined group up Mount
Wanda with the group of volunteers to remove Italian thistle, a spiky invasive
weed that colonizes large areas, impacting and eventually eliminating species
native to those areas. By including both his Scout troop and his classmates from
Alhambra's AP biology and biology classes -- about 20 volunteers total -- an
estimated 4,000 individual plants were removed in just three hours.

However, this barely puts a dent in the population of the invasive species.
"It's an ongoing battle," Brian said. "The thistle will continue to reproduce
and we will continue to pull them."

The National Park Service is constantly looking for volunteers to remove
multiple species of noxious weeds; contact them if you're interested in helping.

Building green means water savings

BYLINE: Frank Williams

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 743 words


Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving energy and using lumber from
sustainable forests are all important elements of the new Green Builder program
recently adopted by San Bernardino County. Most importantly, the new
incentive-based program will encourage dramatic water conservation throughout
the county.

Historically, water supply and conservation has been an important issue
throughout Southern California. Home builders recognize this challenge and have
been striving for decades to build more efficient homes that use less water. New
additions like low-flow toilets and smarter irrigation and landscaping have
resulted in dramatic water savings over the years. In fact, according to the
State Department of Water Resources, water use statewide is expected to grow by
only one percent over the next 25 years, even though the population will grow by
15 million.

Last month, the BIA Baldy View Chapter partnered with Supervisor Brad Mitzelfelt
and state Sen. Bob Dutton, R-Rancho Cucamonga, to host state, county and local
water experts for the first annual San Bernardino County Water Conference. Our
goal: identify solutions to increase the water supply in the Inland Empire to
account for the pending growth. The clear consensus from the conference was the
need to increase local water supplies and aggressively conserve the water we do
have.

Building from this consensus, the BIA Baldy View Chapter, environmental groups
and the county banded together to create a program that would address water
consumption and resource conservation - San Bernardino County Green Builder
(SBCGB). San Bernardino County enacted this historic program to provide
incentives to home builders to encourage participation in the county's Green
Builder program and achieve even greater resource conservation in new homes.

SBCGB is based upon the California Green Builder (CGB) program, which is the
most successful green building program in the state. To date, more than 1,400
CGB-certified homes have been built and 6,700 are in the pipeline this year.
These homes alone are eliminating more than 300,000 pounds of greenhouse gases
each year. Each SBCGB home must beat already-strict energy efficiency standards
by at least 15 percent, recycle half of all construction waste, utilize wood
from sustainable forests and achieve significant water savings.

Most importantly, building green translates into dramatic water savings. Each
SBCGB-certified new home must save 20,000 gallons of water annually, by either
installing innovative plumbing systems, including new designs for landscaping
and irrigation or participation in Metropolitan Water District's California
Friendly water conservation program. Today, CGB homes are saving more than 28
million gallons of water per year and the amount is growing.

However, to ensure water savings is realized, we must support participation in
the program. San Bernardino County's Board of Supervisors recognized this and
coupled incentives with the program. Specifically, if a home builder builds
"green," his project gets priority in the approval process, allowing CGB
certified homes to be built faster, making the program more attractive to
prospective participants.

Time is money, so putting CGB certified projects on a fast track reduces costs
for home builders and ensures that green-built homes are still attainable for
the average family. In fact, the average CGB-certified green home is comparably
priced to standard homes, and homeowners save thousands of dollars in reduced
utility costs by reducing water and electricity usage.

The water conservation achieved by one new green home is significant on its own,
but when spread communitywide, the savings is dramatic. San Bernardino County is
one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, making now an opportune time
to implement SBCGB on a grand scale. Heightened consumer awareness of the
environment, coupled with the commitment to resource conservation by the county
and home builders, will ensure that water savings will be achieved and the
program is a success.

San Bernardino County Green Builder Program is poised to be a hallmark green
building program, but more importantly, it will go a long way toward helping us
meet water needs of the future.

Fear of sour gas follows well blowout

LENGTH: 150  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


A gas well blew out in northwestern Alberta early Wednesday morning, not far
from the home of oilpatch activist Wiebo Ludwig.

A full crew of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. workers was drilling a sweet-gas
well when it blew out around 3 a.m. local time, said Bob Curran, a spokesman for
the Energy Resources Conservation Board. No one was hurt, and the gas started to
be flared off immediately, he said.

Curran said that, although the crew was looking for sweet gas, the Energy
Resources Conservation Board will assume there is sour-gas content until it can
prove otherwise.

Sour gas, unlike sweet gas, contains significant amounts of hydrogen sulphide
(H2S), a compound that can be extremely dangerous to people.

The well site is around 22 kilometres northwest of Hythe, the same area in which
Ludwig, the controversial oilpatch activist, lives.

RCMP said there was nothing suspicious about the incident.

Green building means water savings

BYLINE: By Frank Williams

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving energy and using lumber from
sustainable forests are all important elements of the new Green Builder program
recently adopted by San Bernardino County. Most importantly, the new
incentive-based program will encourage dramatic water conservation throughout
the county.

Historically, water supply and conservation has been an important issue
throughout Southern California. Home builders recognize this challenge and have
been striving for decades to build more efficient homes that use less water. New
additions like low-flow toilets and smarter irrigation and landscaping have
resulted in dramatic water savings over the years. In fact, according to the
State Department of Water Resources, water use statewide is expected to grow by
only one percent over the next 25 years, even though the population will grow by
15 million.

Last month, the BIA Baldy View Chapter partnered with Supervisor Brad Mitzelfelt
and state Sen. Bob Dutton, R-Rancho Cucamonga, to host state, county and local
water experts for the first annual San Bernardino County Water Conference. Our
goal: identify solutions to increase the water supply in the Inland Empire to
account for the pending growth. The clear consensus from the conference was the
need to increase local water supplies and aggressively conserve the water we do
have.

Building from this consensus, the BIA Baldy View Chapter, environmental groups
and the county banded together to create a program that would address water
consumption and resource conservation - San Bernardino County Green Builder
(SBCGB). San Bernardino County enacted this historic program to provide
incentives to home builders to encourage participation in the county's Green
Builder program and achieve even greater resource conservation in new homes.

SBCGB is based upon the California Green Builder (CGB) program, which is the

each year. Each SBCGB home must beat already-strict energy efficiency standards
by at least 15 percent, recycle half of all construction waste, utilize wood

Ruling lets Shell begin on $825M gas project

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 989 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


Construction of the long-delayed, $825-million Caroline sour gas development
will go ahead this autumn following a landmark ruling by Alberta energy
regulators.

Gas, sulphur and chemicals from the huge central Alberta energy development
could be flowing as early as December 1992.

In a decision Friday that sets new environmental and safety standards for the
province's entire energy sector, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board
picked the Shell Canada Ltd. development proposal for the Caroline project over
a rival plan submitted by Husky Oil Ltd.

''It really is the key approval for this very significant project,'' Shell's
Vice-president of development Ray Woods said. ''There's no doubt in my mind that
we've just been through the most exhaustive review process there has ever been
for an energy project'' in Alberta.

The decision allows Shell to build a state-of-the-art gas processing plant in
cattle-ranching country south of the hamlet of Caroline, Alta., and a
44-kilometre pipeline to carry liquid sulphur to an existing sulphur-forming
plant. The capital cost of the project, which at its peak will employ 1,600
construction workers, is estimated at $825 million.

Shell is planning to get a head start on construction before the winter
freeze-up and Caroline production should come on stream by the spring of 1993 at
the latest, Woods said.

The development proposal calls for daily production of 93 million cubic feet of
natural gas, 45,000 barrels of natural gas liquids/condensate and 4,000 metric
tons of sulphur from the Caroline field for the next 30 years. The Alberta
government will receive more than $100 million a year in royalties from the
project.

In its proposal, Husky wanted to upgrade its Ram River gas plant northwest of
the gas field to process the Caroline gas. It now says it will bow to the
Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board ruling.

''We have a clear decision in front of us. It's unequivocal. Shell has the right
to go ahead, and we'll be working with them,'' Lindsay Milne, Husky's
vice-president of exploration and production for Western Canada, said.

A conservation board official said ''public acceptability'' was a key
consideration in the board's decision. Other factors listed in the 135-page
ruling include the distribution of economic benefits for the region.

Shell's Bearberry ''sulphur mine,'' a large ultra-sour gas field southwest of
the Caroline field that will require ground-breaking technology to develop, was
clearly an element that figured in the board decision. Shell argued the company
could ultimately use the same facilities to process both Caroline and Bearberry
gas. The net sulphur emissions from the two projects could be minimized over the
long term, they said.

The board apparently agreed although it said Husky's proposal would lower
sulphur emmissions (a key cause of acid rain) in the short term. The board's
decision sends a signal to the industry that long-range environmental planning
could become a significant regulatory issue.

By approving Shell's proposal, which was supported by all the companies in the
Caroline consortium except Husky, the Alberta board has avoided vetoing an
important development plan backed by a clear majority of the project's
participants.

Shell is the 14-company Caroline consortium's leader, with a 61.2% stake in the
two-trillion-cubic-foot sour gas and gas condensate discovery, the largest
Alberta gas find in 20 years. Husky owns 11.6% of the Caroline project.

The board also has avoided more delays in developing Caroline. Shell officials
had vowed if the board turned down the company's development plan, Shell would
go back to the drawing board to prepare a new development proposal. Analysts
regard Caroline as Shell's crown jewel. They predict the project will give a
huge boost to the petroleum company's production revenues and cash flow, and
could spark the company's languishing stock.

But Shell's victory was won at the price of a bitter and costly public feud with
Husky that delayed the Caroline project by at least two years. Husky estimates
it spent more than $6 million developing its Caroline proposal and defending it
before the conservation board. Shell's front-end costs included $5 million to
$10 million to prepare its application to the board, plus at least $30 million
for premlinary engineering work.

As the majority owner, Shell wanted to maintain operational control of the
Caroline project, while Husky's proposal would have seen all the Caroline
partners sharing the cost of upgrading Husky's 18-year-old Ram River gas plant.
Much of the evidence paraded before the board last April was of an environmental
nature, with both companies claiming an edge.

The precedent set by the exhaustive regulatory hearings surrounding Shell's and
Husky's competing proposals, proceedings that filled an entire month last
spring, could open the door for the Alberat board to usher in tougher
environmental standards for future Alberta energy projects.


''I would definitely say we're moving towards that. The public is going to push
for the best technology available,'' Husky's Milne said.

Ian Doig, editor of Calgary-based energy industry newsletter Doig's Digest, said
Husky should be congratulated for challenging an earlier compromise development
plan that would have been more harmful to the environment and nearby communities
than either the Shell or Husky proposal. Husky succeeded in forcing
environmental and community issues surrounding energy development into the
public spotlight, he said.

Winners in the lengthy public hearings include a large contingent of
environmentalists and area residents who aired their views on the Caroline
project's impact.

Not all preferred Shell's proposal to Husky's, but most of these interest groups
agreed either development plan was better than earlier proposals.

DEAL STATUS:  Terminated
DEAL IN BRIEF:  The Government of New Zealand has withdrawn its plans to sell
49% stake in Solid Energy New Zealand Limited, a coal mining company, due to
drop in the price of coal. The divestment was a part of Government of New
Zealand's program to get its budget back into surplus by 2015 and reduce debt.
Earlier on November 27, 2011, The Government of New Zealand intended to sell
minority stake in three power generation companies Genesis Energy, Meridian
Energy, Mighty River Power, and Solid Energy New Zealand. Subsequently On May
10, 2013, Government of New Zealand completed the sale of 686 million shares,
representing 49% stake in Mighty River Power through an initial public offering
(IPO), at a price of NZD2.5 (US$1.85) per share, for NZD1,715m (US$1,440.19m);
on October 29, 2014, Government of New Zealand completed the sale of
1,255,870,000 shares, representing 49% stake in Meridian Energy through an IPO,
at a price of NZD1.5 (US$1.26) per share, for NZD1.88 billion (US$1.58 billion).
John Key, PM of New Zealand, said, "The government's preference would have been
for a share offer for Mighty River Power this year. It was seen as prudent to
consult further with the Maori on options to settle their claims to water
resources, such as lakes or rivers, used by state-owned hydropower stations. The
preferred focus is to develop models for the control and management of water
that reflect relevant Maori interests." Deal history Withdrwan: On February 25,

Groups lose bid to postpone Alberta's Caroline gas hearings

BYLINE: CP

LENGTH: 467 words

DATELINE: CAROLINE, AB


Canadian Press
  CAROLINE, Alta.
 A plea by environmental groups for a postponement of public hearings on
development of the Caroline natural gas field has been rejected by
Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board.

Too little is known about the risks of tapping poisonous sour gas on
the mammoth scale proposed for the $825-million project, the environmental
groups said.

Lawyers for the groups sought a lengthy adjournment of the case, to
make development sponsors Shell Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd., both of
Calgary, double-check their plans against new safety procedures unveiled
by the board on April 6.

"This is not a speculative thing - this is a serious thing," said
Harvey Locke, lawyer for the Concerned Residents Action Group.

But board chairman Gerry De Sorcy ruled that the hearings will continue
in Caroline, about 120 kilometres northwest of Calgary. He expects the
companies to disclose any changed outlook for the project's safety as a
result of checking during the weeks to come.

The new board system refines methods of assessing risks and preparing
emergency plans for regions affected by development of sour gas. Sour gas
is natural gas that is soaked in hydrogen sulphide, which is lethal in
concentrations of less than 1 per cent.

The Caroline gas deposit is 35 per cent sour, and the project calls for
extracting it at a rate of 300 million cubic feet daily.

A city Calgary's size uses about 100 million cubic feet of gas a day.

Industry experts rate the odds of a fatality from a Caroline sour gas
leak as greater than the chances of being struck by lightning but slightly
less than the likelihood of dying in an airplane accident.

Shell lawyer Don Sabey and Husky lawyer Al McLarty said that while the
companies are still satisfied with the safety of their proposals after
checking them out under the new system, there has only been time so far to
obtain preliminary results.

Up to six weeks is needed to do a complete job of reviewing various
scenarios covering likely effects of well blowouts or pipeline breaks
under various weather conditions.

Mr. Sabey reminded the board that the development schedule calls for
final regulatory approvals by summer, to permit a start on construction
this year. That would put up to 1,500 tradesmen to work and eventually
create more than 300 permanent plant-operating jobs.

The project is forecast to yield more than $10-billion worth of gas,
sulphur and chemical products.

Alberta Environment representative Bob Stone told the board the project
will still need to obtain a series of separate approvals.

He said permits will be required under Alberta's Clean Air Act, Clean
Water Act, Water Resources Preservation Act and Land Surface Conservation
and Reclamation Act.

Mr. Stone said numerous environmental reviews are already under way,
including work with federal authorities.

Huge OSLO project could soon be dead

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 467 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


     Barring an eleventh-hour change of heart by cash-strapped
 federal and provincial governments, the $4.5-billion OSLO oil sands project
will soon be dead.

''We're not optimistic that we're going to go ahead,'' OSLO spokesman Hart
Searle said in an interview yesterday.

Searle, an employee of OSLO's project leader Esso Resources Canada Ltd., has
taken over as official spokesman for the oil sands project following the
transfer to Toronto of former OSLO spokesman Pat Shaw. One of more than 100
people recently transferred out of the Calgary-based OSLO joint venture company,
Shaw is now working for Esso's parent Imperial Oil Ltd.

In addition to Esso, the original six partners in the group were Canadian
Occidental Petroleum Ltd., Petro-Canada, Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., PanCanadian
Petroleum Ltd. and provincially owned Alberta Oilsands Equity.

As of Oct. 1, there were only 27 people left working on the OSLO project, down
from around 140 a year ago, Searle said.

''People are going back to the associated companies and with good reason,'' he
said. ''This phase of the project is coming to a close. We do not have the
financial terms in place to go ahead.''

OSLO's remaining skeleton crew is finishing design engineering reports and
socio-economic studies that must be handed over to the federal and Alberta
governments in return for $40 million in government support for the preliminary
phase of the project.

OSLO's staff is not developing an application for regulatory approval of the oil
sands project, and has not established a new schedule for filing such an
application with the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board, Searle said.

The federal government cancelled a promised financial support package for the
construction phase of the OSLO project, worth roughly $1 billion, in its 1990
budget. The Alberta government said it could not afford to make up the
shortfall, and no other public- or private-sector investors have stepped
forward.

Esso is holding off on an official announcement about OSLO's fate because there
is still a faint chance of renewed discussions with the federal and Alberta
governments over financing. However, no commitments have been made, Searle said.

Imperial's chairman and chief executive, Arden Haynes, said this week the
company is considering building a stand-alone heavy oil upgrader - a project
that most analysts consider an alternative to OSLO, an integrated oil sands
mining and upgrading project.

Searle said yesterday that several possible upgrader sites are under
consideration, including Strathcona, Alta., another near Esso's heavy oil
production operations at Cold Lake, Alta., and a third at Redwater, near
Edmonton, where the OSLO project earlier acquired land for an upgrader.

Watchdog group split in two; Consumers, supply get separate bodies

BYLINE: Gordon Jaremko, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. F1

LENGTH: 666  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


EDMONTON - After 12 years of a forced marriage, Alberta's two energy watchdogs
will regain their former stature as separate agencies responsible for supply
development and consumer protection.

The Conservative government caucus agreed Thursday to a plan to split up the
Alberta Energy and Utilities Board.

Energy Minister Mel Knight vowed to speed up regulation processes and put more
teeth into the system.

A revived Energy Resources Conservation Board will oversee oil, natural gas and
coal development, Knight said.

A separate Alberta Utilities Commission will supervise power deregulation,
consumer price protection and the electricity transmission grid, he said.

The split unravels a marriage imposed on the agencies in 1995 by provincial
budget cuts.

The arrangements included an unsuccessful attempt by former premier Ralph Klein
to make fellow Conservative Ken Kowalski chairman of the AEUB. The appointment
was withdrawn after protests from the business community about a politician
being responsible for energy regulation.

"The situation is very much different than it was 15 years ago," Knight said in
explaining the plan to return to independent agencies with "quasi-judicial"
roles.

Rising energy prices, growing provincial revenues and rapidly expanding industry
overtook the cost savings forecast for the AEUB merger by forcing the combined
agency to grow.

The increasingly busy board handled 60,000 applications last year, the energy
minister said.

Since 1998, the AEUB's staff grew 40 per cent, to 880, and its annual budget
nearly doubled to $136 million, partly covered by levies paid by oil companies.

The new Alberta Utilities Commission will be enlarged to take command of four
agencies spawned by deregulation.

The commission will oversee the Alberta Electric System Operator, Market
Surveillance Administrator and Alberta Utilities Consumer Advocate, Knight said.

The commission will assess the need for additions to the electricity
transmission grid and consider expansion proposals by industry, he said.

Reviews of new projects, such as a plan for a power transmission line between
Edmonton and Calgary, could be completed months earlier under the change, the
energy minister said.

His plan will turn the consumer office, currently a low-profile branch of the
Service Alberta administrative department, into a full-time public defender
bureau.

Under a new name, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates will watchdog the effects of
actions taken by regulated utilities on retail energy costs and supplies.

Knight's plan calls for introduction of legislation this spring to split the
AEUB, followed by a six-month review and transition period.

There will be no disruption of cases now before the board or delays of new
industrial development and utility service applications, he said.

Both the energy board and the utilities commission will initially stay in the
AEUB's current downtown Calgary headquarters, but that could change as the
separation evolves, Knight said.

The former public utilities board had its headquarters in Edmonton for
generations before the merger that created the AEUB, he recalled.

The separation will make the agencies' roles clearer to the public and industry
alike as well as improve their effectiveness, he predicted.

BOARD HISTORY

- 1915: Board of Public Utility Commissioners created with an Edmonton
headquarters as Alberta's first regulatory tribunal, soon renamed the Public
Utilities Board

- 1938: Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, later renamed Energy
Resources Conservation Board, created with a Calgary headquarters after the
province obtains constitutional ownership of natural resources from Ottawa

- 1995: Cost-cutting Conservative government combines the two into the Alberta
Energy and Utilities Board, with headquarters in Calgary.

- 2007: Conservative MLAs agree to split the AEUB and restore the ERCB and
expand the Alberta Utilities Commission, leaving both agencies in Calgary
pending further refinement of the plan.

Oil sands firms warned on tailings ponds;
Alberta regulator says companies are not doing enough to meet targets set in
2009 to curtail growth of the toxic bitumen byproducts

BYLINE: KELLY CRYDERMAN

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ENVIRONMENT; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 613 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


A number of oil sands mining operations are failing to meet targets to slow the
proliferation of tailing ponds, Alberta's energy regulator says.

A report from the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board challenges a
key plank of the Redford government's plan to promote Alberta as a responsible
energy producer, and its pledge that the turbid tailings ponds containing the
byproducts of bitumen production will soon be a thing of the past. During the
Premier's April trade mission to Washington, D.C., Alison Redford said "tailings
ponds [will] disappear from Alberta's landscape in the very near future" and
environmental rules dictate that "the companies who do use mines and tailings
must completely halt the growth of fluid tailings ponds by 2016."

While some progress has been made, the ERCB - which regulates oil and gas
operations across the province - says the overall volume of oil sands fluids
tailings is large and growing. There are now 925 million cubic metres of fluid
tailings in the province, compared to 725 million cubic metres four years ago.

This is despite its Directive 74, introduced in 2009 and meant to be the first
step in a broader initiative to address public concerns and curtail the growth
of toxic tailings ponds. The ERCB now says reduction goals set three years ago
were "optimistic" and the companies won't face penalties because of the problems
they've encountered implementing the costly technologies to capture the oil
sands waste. The report adds pressure on companies already spending hundreds of
millions of dollars to live up to the tailings regulations.

"With the exception of Syncrude, nobody made the achievement that they committed
to and the plans that were approved back in 2010," Terry Abel, an executive
manager for the ERCB, said in an interview.

A report released this month examined four mines, and found at least three - the
one owned by Suncor Energy Inc., and two of Shell Canada Ltd.'s mines - aren't
meeting their targets for capturing and drying fine tailings, or the silts and
clays 44 micrometres or less that take decades to settle. While tailings ponds
help companies recycle water in the short term, solid leftover deposits are
considered more desirable in the longer term, as they allow land to be
"reclaimed" and used for other purposes. Syncrude's Mildred Lake mine exceeded
its capture targets in 2011, but missed them in 2012.

"We're disappointed the progress is not faster. But we're satisfied that they're
doing what they need to do," Mr. Abel said. "We have to acknowledge that
technically, these are complex operations."

The report said Shell argued with the ERCB over the results at its Muskeg River
mine, and the company was not credited with any tailings capture at its Jackpine
mine. Shell spokesman David Williams said the company is "disappointed with the
report" but says it will work with the ERCB. "We fully support the long-term
objective to minimize and eventually eliminate long-term storage of fluid
tailings," he said in an e-mail.

At Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) - an industry group focused on
improvements in environmental performance - Alan Fair said companies are only in
the early stages of Directive 74. "If you don't do it in year 1 or 2, then
you've got to catch up in year 4 or 5. People ought to be focused more on the
longer term."

But the next ERCB report assessing the performance of oil sands companies in the
push to reduce fluid tailings won't be released until 2015. Environmental groups
say this year's report is a clear sign it's irresponsible to approve new oil
sands projects when mine operators are failing to meet current regulations.

Infrastructure needs: Experts push for water conservation

BYLINE: Peer Muhammad

LENGTH: 261  words


Experts at a consultative forum have underlined the importance of taking
pragmatic steps for water resources conservation to ensure sustainable
agriculture and energy development.

They were speaking at a consultative meeting organised by International Centre
for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) here on Wednesday titled,
'Developing the ICIMOD medium term action plan 2018-2022: Emerging opportunities
and priorities for the Hindukush Himalaya Region'.

The speakers noted that water resources both surface and underground are
depleting at a rapid pace and there is a need for long term planning for their
conservation to ensure energy and water security in the country.

Speaking on the occasion, Indus River System Authority (IRSA) Punjab member Rao
Irshad Ahmed Khan mentioned that Pakistan mountainous areas including
Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral have the potential of energy generation, which can
be harnessed for generating clean energy, a way forward towards addressing the
energy crisis.

Besides generating clean energy, such initiatives will also help in provision of
employment opportunities to the people of mountainous areas.

He mentioned that country wasted millions of acre feet (MAF) of rain and flood
water every year, which goes into Arabian Sea because of lack of water
reservoirs. He underlined that building more reservoirs will help in
conservation of water resources in addition to mitigate the flash flood damages
in the downstream areas as the country is losing arable lands and infrastructure
worth billions of rupees due to flash floods.

Texas Agency Denies Permit For Waste Site

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 18; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 321 words

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 22


Citing concerns about a geologic fault line, the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission voted today to deny a license to store low-level nuclear
waste near the Mexico border.

The commission voted 3 to 0 to deny a permit for the proposed radioactive-waste
dump at Sierra Blanca, a town of about 700 near El Paso and 16 miles from
Mexico.

The project had the approval of the Federal Government and the support of state
officials, who said it would help the area's economy.

Environmentalists and the Mexican Government opposed the dump as too dangerous,
as did residents of Sierra Blanca.

"The place had no future with a dump," David Frederick, a lawyer for the Sierra
Blanca Legal Defense Fund. "It may not have a great future now, but at least
there won't be a dump."

The dump was to take in tons of Texas's low-level radioactive waste, most of
which is generated by utilities, and waste from Maine and Vermont.

"We have a part of Texas that is in great need, and this facility could have
helped that," the commission chairman, Barry McBee, said. But Mr. McBee said he
and the other commissioners had too many questions about the safety.

The dump would be in the most seismically active region of the state and above a
source of groundwater for several communities.

The Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, a state agency created
to find a site for the dump, has 20 days to file for a rehearing. If that is
denied, the agency could go to court to try to have the commission's decision
overturned.

Doug Caroom, a lawyer for the authority, argued that the site was needed to
dispose of waste generated by power plants, industry, medical laboratories and
universities.

"The real issue is, what are we going to do with our radioactive waste?" Mr.
Caroom asked. "This site is completely safe to people and the environment. If we
can't license this site, you can't license one at all."

Alberta Energy Ministry to undergo restructuring

BYLINE: GAM

LENGTH: 222 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


The Globe and Mail
  CALGARY
 The Alberta Energy Ministry will undergo a sweeping restructuring and
implement budget cuts in excess of 20 per cent, Energy Minister Patricia
Black announced yesterday.

The plan unites the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Public
Utilities Board into a new regulatory agency, creates a new division to
oversee oil sands research, and streamlines internal administration.

Mrs. Black said details about the impact of the restructuring will not
be known until the provincial budget is released Feb. 24. The department
employs about 1,400 people and has an annual budget of $95-million.

The government is also making changes to the Alberta Petroleum
Marketing Commission. Its policy functions will be shifted into the
ministry, and its marketing business may be moved to private industry. At
present, the government collects oil resource royalties from Alberta
companies by taking possession of the crude oil and selling it through the
marketing commission.

That will change over the next year or so, however, as companies market
the oil and submit their royalties to the government in cash.

With sales of $1-billion a year, the APMC has had significant marketing
clout in the past, but Mrs. Black said she did not believe this change
would reduce the government's ability to influence energy issues in North
America.

Keith Frausto: The Resource Conservation Fair was a success

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 281 words


Many thanks to everyone who made the Resource Conservation Fair at the Resource
Yard such a success on May 5. Hundreds of Boulder County residents turned out to
gather information from some of our energy and conservation-minded vendors,
others to learn more about the yard itself, some to gather their
garden-in-the-box materials, and still others to view the first segment of our
Bold Doors 2012 event, the student competition.

Congratulations to the 60 or so student teams that competed in the Bold Doors
student competition. These student teams from about two dozen local high
schools, middle schools and elementary schools transformed recycled doors into
works of art. When you step back and look at the creativity and energy that went
into their efforts, you become aware of the concern and passion that these young
people have for the world's future, and the critical role each of them will play
in shaping it.

 Keep an eye out for more on Bold Doors 2012, as professional and open category
artists submit their work later this month. In June, a "Door Ways" map will be
available online, in kiosks and businesses to lead people to display locations,
easily accessed via walking, bicycling or public transportation. Please visit
our website to learn more: http://conservationcenter.org/bolddoors.

 Finally, thanks to all the volunteers, CRC staff and board members who spent
countless hours planning, organizing and staffing the Conservation Fair. Your
energy and commitment to creating a thriving community that understands the
finite nature of natural resources and acts to conserve them is infectious.

Farmers and conservation

ABSTRACT

FULL TEXT

Oroville >> The Butte County Resource Conservation District is where farmers,
ranchers and public and private landowners can get their questions answered
about and receive assistance with conservation projects.

Resource Conservation Districts, once known as Soil Conservation Districts, are
"special districts" of the state of California, set up under California law to
be locally governed agencies.

The conservation district is governed by a five-member board appointed by the
county supervisors.

The core functions of a district revolve around its right to use diverse means,
including state and federal funding, to further resource conservation within the
district.

"We do a lot of things conservation-wise in the county," said Sarah Reynolds,
district manager.

It is the "top" district in the state when it comes to farmer participation in
the California Department of Food and Agriculture's State Water Efficiency and
Enhancement Program, which provides farmers and ranchers with grants to
implement irrigation systems that reduce greenhouse gasses and save water,
according to Reynolds.

'On-the-ground partner'

Fifty-seven farmers in Butte County have received $3 million through the Water
Efficiency and Enhancement Program for installing irrigation monitoring
equipment; pump improvements and conversion to efficient irrigation systems on a
total of 3,389 acres. These improvements have included, among other things,
installing moisture meters, changing from flood to drip irrigation systems and
adding solar power to pumps.

"These types of changes make huge reductions in green house gasses because they
use less energy. They also conserve water," said Reynolds.

This year the district contracted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Services for $3.8 million in funding for local
farmers "doing conservation work through soil health, soil erosion prevention,
water bird enhancement habitat and air quality improvement" projects, said
Reynolds.

"Butte County RCD is the boots-on-the-ground partner with farmers, ranchers and
land agents for conservation plans, wild life enhancement, water quantity and
quality support," said Reynolds.

It has also developed a working group with the county, PG&E, Sierra Pacific
Industries, Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest and local recreation
groups of hikers, bicyclists and equestrians to create a Butte County Trails
Plan.

"There is nothing cohesive, there's no integrated map for recreation in the
county or region as a whole. It's a recreation plan so we are taking an
inventory of all trails, roads and recreation areas and making maps. It will be
complete by the end of next year and, ultimately, the goal is to have it adopted
into the county's general plan," said Reynolds.

Through a California State Parks Off Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation grant to
the district, in partnership with Butte County Public Works, Cal Fire and local
off-road vehicle group volunteers, is also tasked with providing maintenance of
48 miles of off-road trails in Plumas National Forest and 39 miles of the
county-maintained Concow, Dixie and French Creek roads.

Other projects include a partnership with Butte County Public Works to create an
inventory of gravel and unpaved roads in the Butte Creek and Feather River
watershed areas. The purpose of the inventory is to "assist the county in
assessing and maintaining these non-native surface roads while protecting the
water and fish habitat," said Reynolds.

The agency has also teamed with the county and PG&E to replace and maintain, at
a two-to-one ratio, any trees the power company has to cut down in the
unincorporated areas of the county because of interference with gas lines.

The first project the district handled under this contract was along the Midway
in Durham, where PG&E needed to remove about 34 trees.

"In the spring before they took out the trees, we planted 32 trees. In October,
after they cut down the trees, we planted another 36 trees," said Reynolds.

The district also takes orders for, sells and distributes owl, duck and bat
nesting boxes built by the Butte County 4-H Youth Development Program to
ranches, farmers and "any county resident interested in providing wildlife
habitat on their property," said Reynolds.

The boxes cost $100 each and all funds go directly back into the 4-H program.

ABSTRACT

FULL TEXT

Oroville >> The Butte County Resource Conservation District is where farmers,
ranchers and public and private landowners can get their questions answered
about and receive assistance with conservation projects.

Resource Conservation Districts, once known as Soil Conservation Districts, are
"special districts" of the state of California, set up under California law to
be locally governed agencies.

The conservation district is governed by a five-member board appointed by the
county supervisors.

The core functions of a district revolve around its right to use diverse means,
including state and federal funding, to further resource conservation within the
district.

"We do a lot of things conservation-wise in the county," said Sarah Reynolds,
district manager.

It is the "top" district in the state when it comes to farmer participation in
the California Department of Food and Agriculture's State Water Efficiency and
Enhancement Program, which provides farmers and ranchers with grants to
implement irrigation systems that reduce greenhouse gasses and save water,
according to Reynolds.

'On-the-ground partner'

Fifty-seven farmers in Butte County have received $3 million through the Water
Efficiency and Enhancement Program for installing irrigation monitoring
equipment; pump improvements and conversion to efficient irrigation systems on a
total of 3,389 acres. These improvements have included, among other things,
installing moisture meters, changing from flood to drip irrigation systems and
adding solar power to pumps.

"These types of changes make huge reductions in green house gasses because they
use less energy. They also conserve water," said Reynolds.

This year the district contracted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Services for $3.8 million in funding for local
farmers "doing conservation work through soil health, soil erosion prevention,
water bird enhancement habitat and air quality improvement" projects, said
Reynolds.

"Butte County RCD is the boots-on-the-ground partner with farmers, ranchers and
land agents for conservation plans, wild life enhancement, water quantity and
quality support," said Reynolds.

It has also developed a working group with the county, PG&E, Sierra Pacific
Industries, Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest and local recreation
groups of hikers, bicyclists and equestrians to create a Butte County Trails
Plan.

"There is nothing cohesive, there's no integrated map for recreation in the
county or region as a whole. It's a recreation plan so we are taking an
inventory of all trails, roads and recreation areas and making maps. It will be
complete by the end of next year and, ultimately, the goal is to have it adopted
into the county's general plan," said Reynolds.

Through a California State Parks Off Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation grant to
the district, in partnership with Butte County Public Works, Cal Fire and local
off-road vehicle group volunteers, is also tasked with providing maintenance of
48 miles of off-road trails in Plumas National Forest and 39 miles of the
county-maintained Concow, Dixie and French Creek roads.

Environmental groups warn of earthquake lawsuit against 4 Oklahoma energy
companies

BYLINE: By Paul Monies Business Writer pmonies@oklahoman.com

LENGTH: 913 words


Two environmental groups have warned Oklahoma oil and gas companies of their
intent to file a federal lawsuit over the links between wastewater disposal
wells and the state's sharp rise in earthquake activity.Washington-based Public
Justice and the Oklahoma Sierra Club said they plan to bring a lawsuit under the
federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a 1976 law which allows citizen
lawsuits over hazardous waste. They want the companies to reduce the volumes of
wastewater injected into disposal wells. They also want to establish an
"independent forecasting body" that will investigate, analyze and predict the
cumulative effect of injecting production wastewater.The groups sent certified
letters last week detailing their intent to SandRidge Energy Inc., Devon Energy
Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp. and New Dominion LLC."I am angry and offended
that the oil and gas industry has been so slow to protect Oklahoma and its
citizens in the face of this earthquake crisis," Barbara Vanhanken, chairwoman
of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement released Monday.

"Stopping this ever-strengthening earthquake crisis is critical to the health
and well-being of all Oklahomans.&nbsp;To ignore the human cost being paid for
the earthquake problems tied to oil and gas operations in Oklahoma is
cold-blooded and heartless.&nbsp;It reinforces the concept that profits matter
more than people."Devon and Chesapeake declined to comment. New Dominion's
general counsel, Fred Buxton, said he had seen the letter but couldn't comment.
SandRidge did not return calls for comment.&nbsp;Oklahoma has had more than 720
earthquakes greater than 3.0-magnitude this year, surpassing last year's total
of 585 in that category. Several scientific papers have linked the state's
increase in earthquakes to higher volumes of produced water disposal from oil
and gas activity.Regulators at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission have focused
on wastewater injections into the deep Arbuckle formation, long a favored
disposal location for the extremely salty "fossil water" that comes up with oil
and natural gas. Some operators had drilled through the Arkbuckle into the
crystalline basement, increasing the risk of triggered earthquakes. They were
asked to reduce the depths of those wells, while other wells came under
voluntary directives to reduce volumes or shut in completely.Two earthquakes
struck central Oklahoma on Monday, including a 4.4-magnitude quake about four
miles west of Langston at 10:57 a.m. That was followed by a 3.4-magnitude quake
at 11:35 a.m. about five miles northeast of Langston. There were no immediate
reports of injury or damage.Injection volumes detailedThe letter from Public
Justice and the Sierra Club included several attachments detailing the volumes
of wastewater injected by SandRidge, Chesapeake, New Dominion and Devon. Using
volume data collected by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, it said the
companies accounted for 59 percent of the saltwater injected into the Arbuckle
formation in 2014.SandRidge, with 91 Arbuckle disposal wells, accounted for
201.7 million of the 673 million barrels of wastewater injected into the
Arbuckle formation last year. Chesapeake had 14 disposal wells injecting 73.9
million barrels in that formation. New Dominion injected 72.1 million barrels
into the Arbuckle in 2014, while Devon injected 64.5 million barrels of
wastewater, according to commission data compiled by Public Justice.Paul Bland,
Public Justice's executive director, said any lawsuit brought under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act would be the first of its kind regarding the risks
from induced seismicity from disposal wells. He said the groups would show the
ongoing injection volumes are posing "an imminent and substantial endangerment
to health or the environment.""The ball is totally in their court," Bland said
of the companies. "They could work out something with us, or they could fight us
in court."Bland said the increase in number and severity of earthquakes in
Oklahoma increases the risk."Think of a big crack in a piece of ice and you were
tapping on it with a hammer or chisel," he said. "Each tap may not be
significant, but at some point the crack begins to change."Public Justice has
used the law successfully to fight harmful runoff from manure produced from
large dairy farms in Yakima, Wash. It's also used the law over large deposits of
coal ash in Pennsylvania, Bland said.Energy group respondsChad Warmington,
president of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, said the environmental groups
were attempting to use federal law to undermine the work of the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission."This is nothing more than business as usual for these
groups in their attempts to completely destroy the production of oil and natural
gas in the United States," Warmington said in an email. "Their threatened
lawsuit is completely unnecessary and unwarranted."Warmington pointed to a
three-hour hearing on induced seismicity last week at the Capitol that included
presentations from the Oklahoma Geological Survey, Corporation Commissioner Dana
Murphy and the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board."The actions taken by the
commission have been strong, decisive and based on good science," he said. "Any
outside group that claims otherwise is either ill-informed or willfully
deceitful. The Corporation Commission has this under control and does not need
the federal government interfering in their processes."

Wainwright resurges

BYLINE: John DeMont

SECTION: SECTION 4, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 31, OIL ACTION

LENGTH: 165 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  ADD THE Wainwright field - first discovered 20 years ago - to the fast-growing
list of hot Alberta oil plays. Spurring the resurgence in activity is some solid
drilling success in the Nisku zone, which is somewhat deeper than the
traditional oil-producing zones in the area.

More than 40 wells are currently being drilled in the region as companies such
as Argyll Energy Corp., Bluesky Oil & Gas Ltd. and Bow Valley Industries Ltd.
stalk the potentially rich, but shallow and inexpensive reef-like formations.

While Alberta's Energy Resources & Conservation Board has restricted production
in the area to the minimum allowable rate of 50 barrels a day, no one is
complaining. Because the oil is fairly heavy - about 18 degrees American
Petroleum Institue - the wells can be drilled on 40-acre spacings, which means
that 16 wells can be on production per section (640 acres) of land instead of
the usual four per section allowed for conventional lighter crude

Regulator assails Plains Midstream over 2011 spill

BYLINE: KELLY CRYDERMAN

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ENERGY; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 632 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Alberta's energy regulator has highlighted a series of major failings in Plains
Midstream Canada's handling of an April, 2011, pipeline rupture that spilled
28,000 barrels of oil into a northern Alberta muskeg, saying the company
appeared to place a higher priority on keeping the pipeline running than on any
concerns about a leak.

Almost two years after the Rainbow pipeline fractured near the Woodland Cree
reserve northeast of Peace River - thrusting Alberta pipeline-safety issues into
an international spotlight - the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board
(ERCB) has released the findings of its investigation. The board found major
flaws in the company's operations and maintenance procedures, as well as its
leak-detection alarms and response.

The Rainbow sweet-crude spill spewed a strong hydrocarbon odour into the local
area, and contaminated a forested area and wetlands. The ERCB report said the
company's cleanup found that 79 birds, 11 beavers and other small animals died
as a result of the spill.

"The actions of Plains appeared to demonstrate a practice of placing higher
priority on continued operation of the pipeline over any potential impacts
related to a pipeline leak," said Tuesday's ERCB report on Alberta's largest
crude spill in 36 years.

"The volume of the release was much greater than it should have been under the
circumstances."

However, the energy regulator stopped short of issuing any new penalties. ERCB
spokesman Darin Barter said normally when the board lists a number of "high-risk
enforcement actions" (essentially charges from the ERCB), the regulator would
shut down a company's pipeline. However, he said Plains Midstream's pipeline was
already shut down for the 122 days following the spill, at a cost of what the
ERCB argues was $850-million to the Alberta economy.

"We didn't feel the need to go forward and shut them in again. We thought it was
more important to ensure that prior to re-opening that pipeline that it was
safe," Mr. Barter said. "They've essentially completed the requirements to
fulfill those high-risk enforcement actions. So it's retroactive."

The report released on Tuesday had a long litany of censures for the company,
including a "lack of operator training." In fact, the pipeline was restarted
manually by an operator three times, even after an electronic monitoring system
detected a rupture and initiated automatic shutdowns.

Mr. Barter said the investigation found "the operator kept turning off the
alarm." He said the staff member at the time no longer works for Plains
Midstream and the board couldn't get in touch with him for an interview to find
out why.

Company officials weren't available for comment but issued a statement Tuesday
afternoon saying it is carefully reviewing the ERCB's investigation "to
determine whether any further findings and improvements can be applied to our
operations. We have finalized the results of our own detailed investigation and
have applied those lessons learned to improve our overall operations."

Mr. Barter said the regulator has also asked Plains Midstream to conduct an
emergency-response exercise by the end of next month, as well as a
crisis-communications audit - since its communication with the media and local
residents in 2011was "substandard."

He added that Alberta's Environment department, which has the power to issue
environmental fines, is still looking into the spill.

Mr. Barter said the investigation into the pipeline rupture was "exhaustive" and
that's why the report is only being issued now. The ERCB also continues its
investigation into Plains Midstream's June, 2012, pipeline spill beneath the Red
Deer River near Sundre, Alta. Mr. Barter said the ERCB has stepped up its
scrutiny of Plains operations due to the two incidents.

Companies ordered to shut gas wells

BYLINE: Carrie Tait

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; BUSINESS TICKER / NORTH AMERICA /
RESOURCES; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 128 words


The Energy Resources Conservation Board has ordered a number of companies to
shut down natural gas wells in the oil sands, arguing the wells create
"significant risk to future in situ bitumen recovery." The regulator decided 691
wells must be shut-in. Canadian Natural Resource Ltd. and Perpetual Energy
Operating Corp. will be the most affected. The pair, along with Japan Canada Oil
Sands Ltd., initially objected to requests other companies made to have the
wells shut down, although CNRL and Perpetual later backed off with respect to
some of the wells. CNRL said it is not surprised by the decision. "The shut-ins
[from two interim hearings] were effective Oct. 31, 2009.  They were not in our
2010 or 2011 reported volumes, nor included in our forecasted volumes."

GAS PIPELINE PROPOSAL UNDER REVIEW

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 455 words


From noise pollution by compressor engines to effects on natural gas supplies,
all aspects of the last leg in the Alberta-to-California pipeline project are
being reviewed this week in Calgary.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board opened hearings Tuesday on Calgary-based
Nova Corp.'s $ 120-million Alberta share in the international energy
transportation megaproject.

Nova wants to expand its gas-gathering pipeline web to fill the California line
of Alberta Natural Gas Co. and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. of Calgary, and two San
Francisco firms: Pacific Gas Transmission Co. and parent Pacific Gas & Electric
Co.

Nova requests an ERCB decision by March 1, to meet a target date of Nov. 1 set
for starting deliveries forecast to generate a 15-per-cent increase in gas
exports and net about $ 1 billion a year in new sales revenues.

National authorities on both sides of the border approved the project long ago.
The $ 1.6-billion US Pacific Gas share is 75-per-cent built. Foothills and
Alberta Natural have launched work on their $ 224-million leg in Canada.

But the schedule is unsettled.

The project is under review again in the ERCB's Calgary headquarters, because
rivals and critics fired off a barrage of complaints to the board to voice
doubts over its effects.

The attack is led by Altamont Gas Transmission Co. and its Calgary part-owner,
Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. The pair lost a race with Pacific Gas to win
approvals and start construction last year.

Although Amoco is the only major gas-production firm fighting Pacific Gas, the
big opponent is backed by smaller exporters such as Czar Resources Ltd.

Critics say Pacific Gas's facilities spell excess pipeline capacity and
price-cutting sales scrambles, because other projects have also been built to
increase deliveries into California from U.S. wells .

The ERCB agreed competition is bound to accelerate, in a landmark report
released in mid-1992 after a lengthy fact-finding inquiry into the California
pipeline race.

But the ERCB said the decision on whether to support any new pipeline is up to
Alberta gas producers. Pacific Gas's new capacity remains fully booked, with no
subscribers trying to back out of transportation-service contracts.

The project's backers include a who's-who of the Canadian energy industry,
ranging from Alberta Energy Co. to Imperial Oil Ltd.

The ERCB made no promises to meet Nova's schedule when a three-man panel under
board member Phillip Prince opened the hearings.

ERCB officials said they hope testimony can be completed this week, but
interveners have reserved rights to field up to 15 panels of expert
witnesses.The complex case has drawn in 53 companies and business groups.

LENGTH: 201 words


The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality is reviewing a request from the
U.S. Department of Energy and Idaho National Laboratory to renew a permit
regulating the storage and treatment of hazardous waste at the Materials and
Fuels Complex.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Storage and Treatment Permit expires
Aug. 16. A renewal would extend the permit for another decade.

""State regulations require a permit for 10 years,"" said Alan Carvo, MFC
program environmental lead. ""If we want to continue our operations beyond that
period of time, we are required to submit an application to continue beyond the
previous permit.""

The permit allows the MFC to store and manage solid, liquid and debris-mixed
radioactive and hazardous waste generated from research and development projects
of nuclear fuels.

Questions or comments on the permit can be emailed to Robert Bullock, DEQ
hazardous waste permit manager, at robert.bullock@deq.idaho.gov The permit
renewal application is available for review on the DEQ's website at tinyurl
.com/MFCpermit.

Carvo expects the DEQ to open the permit for a public hearing within six months.

Residents win appeal over sour gas wells; Energy board must address safety
concern, court rules

BYLINE: Darcy Henton, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B9

LENGTH: 469  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


An Alberta court ruling Wednesday could dramatically complicate the approval
process for companies looking to drill potentially deadly sour gas wells.

The Alberta Court of Appeal found that residents in the Rocky Rapids area about
140 kilometres southwest of Edmonton were wrongly denied their rights to oppose
a pair of wells containing deadly hydrogen sulphide.

The residents' lawyer, Jennifer Klimek, said her clients are thrilled with the
decision.

"They are just dancing," she said.

"Can you imagine the difference this will make in the number of people who can
show up at hearings and must be consulted? This will certainly change things.
More people will now have a say in sour gas development."

The court ruled the Energy Resources Conservation Board erred Jan. 16 when it
decided three women residing in homes three to six kilometres from the Grizzly
Resources Ltd. wells failed to show they would be "directly and adversely
affected" by the development.

Susan Kelly, Lillian Duperron and Linda McGinn claimed they should have a right
to oppose the wells because they resided in an area the board defined as a
protective action zone or PAZ, where outdoor pollutant concentrations of
hydrogen sulphide gas could cause "life-threatening or serious and possibly
irreversible health effects."

The appeal court said the board's own definition "indicates those who live in a
PAZ could have their rights directly or adversely affected as a result of a
hazardous release."

"It is difficult to see how any other conclusion could be available," said the
appeal court panel of Justices Jean Cote, Peter Martin and Myra Bielby.

"Should the wells leak and the wind be blowing from the southeast, poisonous gas
could be blown over and into the appellant's homes and farms."

Although the wells have been drilled without incident, the court said the issue
is still relevant because the wells are not yet in production.

"The fact that Grizzly chose to take upon itself the risk of drilling wells,
which it may not be permitted to operate, or operate unconditionally, does not
render this matter moot," the court said in a 13-page decision.

"The appellants noted that, if after a rehearing, the ERCB permits Grizzly to
operate the wells, it may impose conditions on their operation, which are
designed to address their safety concerns."

McGinn, who lives 2.9 kilometres from the wells, said she's ecstatic.

"I feel so powerful," she said. "I feel like we have finally been heard."

She said she was frustrated when the board ruled the women couldn't have a say
in the matter.

"I stamped my foot mentally and said:'Yes, we do count. We all live here. We
have a say.' "

The Energy Resources Conservation Board said it is looking at the decision and

Tata Power Club Enerji introduces new online module on Disaster Management

LENGTH: 696  words

DATELINE: New York



 Terrebonne: Electric Energy Quebec has issued the following release news:



  spreading the message of being responsible citizens by conserving energy and
resources across the country, with a strategic focus on nation building. In line
with this commitment, the company announced the launch of a new online module of
the Club Enerji programme, devised on disaster management. The module is hosted
on the Club Enerji website - www.clubenerji.com  and users would simply need to
register to access to it.





 The objective of the initiative is to reach out to a larger audience and impact
a larger group of IT skilled children with a vision to transform by adopting a
holistic and robust approach towards conservation. This year the company has
added content which focuses on disaster management. The content contains topics
on understanding climate change, various tips on disaster management and do it
yourself disaster management kit tutorials.



 India has been traditionally vulnerable to natural disasters on account of its
unique geo-climatic conditions. About 60 per cent of the landmass is prone to
earthquakes, over 40 million hectares is prone to floods, about 8 per cent of
the total area is prone to cyclones and 68 per cent of the area is susceptible
to drought. Natural calamities such as the Bhuj earthquake accounted for 13,805
deaths, the super cyclone in Orissa accounted for 9885 deaths. Each year
disasters also account for loss of thousands of crores in terms of social and
community assets. Realising the impact of such disasters, Club Enerji devised a
module which caters towards spreading awareness on disaster management.



 Speaking on this initiative, Anil Sardana, MD and CEO, Tata Power, said, "At
Tata Power, we are determined to strengthen our Club Enerji programme and reach
out to a global audience to encourage the IT skilled children of today to become
responsible citizens of tomorrow. The latest online module on disaster
management is aimed at making the future generation realise the importance of a
sustainable world, and we are committed to widen the reach of the programme to
help and sensitize an even larger portion of people in India and abroad."



 With a view to provide a more holistic content to children, the module also
includes content on 'creating responsible citizens' ,' tips for energy and
resource conservation' , 'tracking energy usage ' and a quiz game. Since its
inception, the online module of Club Enerji has reached international
geographies like the USA, UK, Philippines, UAE, and South Africa, while also
creating a positive impact in domestic cities like Chandigarh, Hyderabad,
Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Chennai.



 The online module is divided into four levels with a focus on energy
conservation; fuel and water conservation; waste management and afforestation;
and conservation of civic and moral values respectively. The module uses a mix
of text, infographics, interactive video graphics, and video tutorials to
educate the members. The online interactive game will also help in ensuring
higher levels of engagement and recall.

Groups press Canada on oil sands;
In the Blogs: Green Inc.

BYLINE: JOHN LORINC

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 416 words

ABSTRACT

Environmental groups this past week released an unflattering appraisal showing
that seven of Alberta's nine oil sands projects will fail to meet new cleanup
rules for the tailing ponds near bitumen refineries.

FULL TEXT

With Canada facing mounting international pressure to confront its sluggish
emission-reduction record heading into the Copenhagen climate meetings in the
coming week, environmental groups released yet another unflattering appraisal
this past week - this one showing that seven of Alberta's nine oil sands
projects will fail to meet new cleanup rules for the vast tailing ponds near
bitumen refineries.

Absent compliance, the Pembina Institute and the Water Matters Society of
Alberta estimate that by 2020, Alberta's tailing ponds could contain about 1.1
billion liters, or 300 million gallons, of toxic liquid and cover almost 260
square kilometers, or 100 square miles. Those figures represent a 30 percent
increase over current volumes.

After assessing corporate and government data, the grouping concluded that most
oil sands projects are years away from complying with a February 2009 directive
requiring producers to capture 50 percent of fine particles by the middle of
2013.

The tailing ponds made headlines in the spring of 2008 when hundreds of ducks
died after landing in them.

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board announced the new cleanup rules
after the controversy. Simon Dyer, a Pembina oil sands analyst, said in a news
release that it was ''troubling'' that most producers did not appear to be
moving toward compliance.

Oil company executives say the delays have to do with the slow development of
technologies capable of sifting the suspended materials out of the ponds,
according to The Globe and Mail, which also quoted an official from the Energy
Resources Conservation Board as saying that new applications would not be
granted without approved cleanup plans.

Mr. Dyer told Green Inc. that it had been very difficult to determine whether
the government was actually enforcing its own rules. ''There is a real lack of
information,'' he said.

That conclusion dovetails with a hard-hitting investment risk assessment on the
oil sands released late last month by Northwest & Ethical Investments, which is
part of the Ethical Funds Co. in Vancouver. The fund managers said that only
Shell had established clear emission reduction targets, while most other
producers failed to disclose mitigation strategies or plans to address water and
land-use issues.

RC&D to hire rural forester

BYLINE: Jim Kalvelage jkalvelage@ruidosonews.com

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 326 words


A rural community forester, similar to the position created in Ruidoso nearly 10
years ago, will come to Lincoln and Otero counties.

The South Central Mountain Resource Conservation and Development Council posted
the job offering on Monday.

The rural community forester would provide assistance to landowners in the two
counties, work with residents and groups toward implementing wildland urban
interface practice plans.

The forester would also work to enhance forested and watershed ecosystems.

The forester would offer educational opportunities for landowner groups and
organizations about the importance of natural resource management and urban
forestry, and assist with the development of viable forest products industries.

The position would assist the Resource Conservation and Development coordinator
in other projects.

The coordinator is Rick DeIaco, who had been Ruidoso's forestry department
director until taking his current job with the South Central Mountain RC&D two
years ago.

Specific duties for the rural community forester may include wildfire hazard
assessment and reduction, FIREWISE related programs, forest and watershed
restoration, renewable energy projects, inspections and other initiatives.

In the past employees with New Mexico's State Forestry Division have assisted
property owners in assessing wildfire threats and the assembly of a mitigation
plan that typically reduced trees on overgrown lands.

Minimum requirements include experience in forestry, ecology, fire suppression
or other natural resources related fieldwork or a Bachelor of Science degree in
forestry.

The annual salary has a range from $35,360 to $39,520.

There are no annual or sick leave benefits, nor health benefits. The position is
currently funded for three years.

The office will be located in Carrizozo, though much of the job will be outdoors
with irregular hours.

Applications to the South Central Mountain RC&D must be postmarked or emailed by
12 p.m. on May 21.

County's Stimulus Money Stretching Farther Than Expected

BYLINE: Chris Henry, Kitsap Sun, Bremerton, Wash.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 806 words


Aug. 12--PORT ORCHARD -- Kitsap County will be able to complete more renovation
work than expected on its facilities using a Department of Energy stimulus
grant, thanks in part to the recent replacement of courthouse windows coming in
$30,000 under budget.

The county in 2009 received $2.23 million from the DOE in the form of an Energy
Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant. The county, in its grant application,
proposed a variety of energy saving endeavors involving resource conservation,
"green" building techniques and promotion of local food production.

Grant-funded projects, such as the courthouse window replacement, will save the
county money in the long run by conserving energy and reducing utility bills,
said Autumn Salamack, resource conservation manager for the county and overseer
of the grant. Projects also are aimed at creating green jobs to promote economic
development.

The courthouse project, originally expected to cost $478,536, will be finished
by the end of the week, except for some detail work, according to James McGuire
of Pacific Glass Inc. of Renton, who was working on the windows Monday.

Besides the $30,000 in savings on the courthouse retrofit, the county received a
$30,394 rebate from Puget Sound Energy on lighting upgrades at the Kitsap Sun
Pavilion and Presidents Hall at Kitsap County Fairgrounds & Events Center. In
addition, county officials have removed a $6,000 solar hot water heater project
from the list because the technology was found to be less-than-ideal for the
pavilion, where it was to be installed.

Salamack expects a radiant heating project at the Presidents Hall to come in
under budget by $6,000 to $17,000. The net amount of grant money freed up by
savings, rebates and changes could range from $72,394 to $83,394, Salamack told
the county's board of commissioners this week.

The county will use $31,250 of the money for lighting and heating upgrades at
county parks, expected to result in a 30 percent energy cost savings. Facilities
included in the project are Buck Lake, Wildcat Lake, Salsbury Point, Long Lake
and Anna Smith county parks. The county will use $10,000 of the money to
retrofit lighting at the fairgrounds' Van Zee Building.

As for the remainder, Salamack said, "We're currently investigating the best
projects to put the money toward to achieve the greatest cost savings on our
energy bills and to achieve the greatest reduction in energy use."

The county, in partnership with the Home Builders Association of Kitsap County,
will use $423,294 of the $2.23 million for "Built Green" projects. These include
energy efficient upgrades at the HBA building in Bremerton and a green-built
spec home to help educate local contractors on energy efficient techniques.

DOE requirements for how the partnership is to be structured are presenting
challenges to these projects, said Salamack and Art Castle, executive vice
president of the Home Builders Association. Castle would like the HBA to have a
greater say in the subcontractor bidding process. The HBA and the county are
working to find a resolution, and the two projects are still on track, Salamack
said.

A third phase of the Built Green initiative has been abandoned. The county and
HBA had planned to use $253,259 in grant money for retrofits of public and
private buildings, but the two have been unable to hammer out an acceptable
arrangement. The grant money must be used within a reasonable time frame,
Salamack said, and so county and HBA officials have agreed to shift the money
toward weatherization of individual homes.

The $253,259 will go to help moderate-income homeowners pay for energy audits,
required to qualify for weatherization loans. The audits, which cost $600 to
$750, identify ways homeowners can reduce energy costs.

Puget Sound Energy customers can already get a $350 rebate per audit. Cascade
Natural Gas customers are not eligible for rebates. The grant money would
provide up to $200 per household toward the audit for customers of both
utilities.

Many of the cost-saving measures identified through the audits would be minor,
yet result in long-term savings, Salamack said. Homeowners could apply for
low-interest loans, made available through a stimulus-funded loan guarantee
pool, to cover more costly weatherization projects.

The homeowners' weatherization program will launch in October. For more

Enbridge shuts down pipeline

BYLINE: JEFFREY JONES Reuters

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D5

LENGTH: 259 words


CALGARY - Enbridge Inc. has closed a major Alberta pipeline that moves oil
sands-derived crude after a spill at a pump station, the second oil leak in the
Canadian province in less than two weeks, regulators said Tuesday.

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board said Enbridge was forced to turn
off its 345,000 barrel-a-day Athabasca pipeline following a spill Monday that
the company estimates at about 1,400 barrels.

The 540-km line carries oil to Hardisty, Alberta, from the tar sands center of
Fort McMurray. Hardisty is a major pipeline hub from which crude gets fed into
networks of export lines to the United States, such as Enbridge's mainline and
TransCanada Corp's Keystone Pipeline.

The oil spilled south of the northeastern Alberta town of Elk Point, the board
said.

"The pipeline has been shut in and the pumping station has been isolated," the
Energy Resources Conservation Board said in a statement. "No waterways are
impacted and cleanup is under way. There were no injuries or no evacuations as a
result of the release."

The incident follows an oil spill from a pipeline owned by Plains All American
in western Alberta on June 7 in which cleanup efforts are continuing. Up to
3,000 barrels of oil leaked into the a large river system, fouling up a vacation
resort area.

Environmentalists opposed to multibillion-dollar pipelines planned to take
hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of Alberta crude to Texas and the Pacific
Coast pounced on that spill as reason to reject the proposals.

Enbridge officials weren't available for comment.

Enbridge pipeline spill adds to worry; Director of B.C. First Nations group says
incident underlines their concerns

A faulty gasket is to blame for the 230,000 litres of oil discovered Monday
spilling from Enbridge's Athabasca pipeline, says a spokesman for the Energy
Resources Conservation Board.

About 1,445 barrels of heavy crude oil leaked out of the pump station where the
gasket was located. The 541kilometre pipeline stretches from the Fort McMurray
oilsands to Hardisty and has a capacity of 345,000 barrels per day.

Enbridge spokesman Graham White said it is not possible to offer an estimate of
the area affected by the spill because "some areas are more affected than
others."

"The area affected is our pump station site, some area along the pipeline
right-of-way that is also (owned by) Enbridge and part of a local field," White
said in an email Wednesday.

"The vast majority of the spill is on the site and there is no impact to
waterways or wildlife."

About 180 barrels of oil spread on to a neighbouring landowner's property, said
Darin Barter, spokesman for Energy Resources Conservation Board.

White said the company is keeping the site closed to reporters because of
"safety and operational issues."

He could not say how long it will take to clean up the spill site, about 24
kilometres southeast of Elk Point.

Clean-up and investigation crews have been on-site since Monday.

Barter said leaks in pump stations are "fairly rare," and investigators will
look into "less obvious" reasons behind the release, such as operating pressure.
The pipeline was shut down early Monday and the pumping station fenced in.

The pump station has been decommissioned and the pipeline has been reopened,
Barter said.

Enbridge's Athabasca pipeline spill is the third major pipeline break in Alberta
in two months - breaks in a Plains Midstream line near Sundre and a Pace Oil and
Gas Ltd. well in northern Alberta are also being cleaned up.

Having the incidents so close together is unusual and "not indicative of
Alberta's level of safety," Barter said.

"Given the enormous amount of oil and gas infrastructure in this province, it's
a very safe system."

He said the recent spills are "very different incidents."

Mike Deising, press secretary for Alberta Energy Minister Ken Hughes, said the
province has a "good" pipeline system.

"T he problem is we have 400,000 kilometres of pipeline and occasionally, we
will have a spill," Deising said.

Premier Alison Redford said pipeline spills "happen sometimes" and are part of
balancing social and economic factors.

"I think people have a pretty good appreciation of the fact that there does need
to be a balance and it is unfortunate when these things happen," Redford said.

The province is backing the construction of the controversial Enbridge Northern
Gateway pipeline, intended to transport Alberta bitumen from Hardisty to
Kitimat, B.C.

If built, the pipeline would allow Alberta to sell its oil to booming Asian
markets.

The project has faced fierce opposition and Art Sterritt, executive director of
Coastal First Nations, said the latest spill underlines their concerns. "We
don't like to say we told you so, but we did," Sterritt said.

"Folks out here are not taking any great pleasure in the fact that there're oil
spills all over Alberta. However, the industry itself is demonstrating to
British Columbians that they don't have their act together and B.C.ers are not
going to allow the same thing to happen here."

To critics who draw a link between the nearby spill and potential breaks in a
future Northern Gateway pipeline, White noted this particular spill was quickly
found, likely not related to pipeline integrity, and "appropriate, immediate and
effective actions (were taken) to contain the product and mobilize response
crews for cleanup, inspection and assessment."

SECTION: Pg. B2

LENGTH: 398 words

DATELINE: BANGOR


The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in Maine has received almost
$112,000 in Conservation Innovation Grants for four Maine organizations.

As a component of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, CIG is a
statewide competitive grants process to address some of the state's most
pressing natural resource conservation needs, according to State Conservationist
Joyce Swartzendruber.

Recipients of CIG funds are the Androscoggin Valley Soil and Water Conservation
District, Community Energy Partners LLC, Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners
Association, and the University of Maine.

"These grants offer an opportunity to provide innovative approaches to
environmental enhancement and protection on working agricultural lands," said
Swartzendruber. "Through these partnerships we hope to develop new technologies
that increase the protection of our state's resources."

The Androscoggin Valley Soil and Water Conservation District received $20,000 to
assist it in carrying out Phase I of a Carbon Credit Project. The purpose of
Phase I is to establish a Carbon Credit Program for Maine. This will consist of
development of a pilot outreach and education program geared toward established
farm and forest landowners, as well as beginning, limited resource and women
farmers.

The Community Energy Partners received more than $43,000 to assist them in
"Moving Agricultural Communities toward Conservation and Locally Owned
Windfarming." This project proposes to conduct a statewide outreach work plan
aimed at farmers and their communities about the costs, benefits and impacts of
community wind. Community wind is one of the types of community energy.

The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association received more than $26,000
to help provide equipment and technical support to farmers for "Improving
Maine's Pastures and Hayfields with No-Till Drilling Techniques and Improved
Nutrient Management." Maine's grass-based farmers will be provided with
education and resources to restore hayfields and pastures with low-input
systems.

The University of Maine received approximately $22,000 to help develop "Biomass
Harvesting Guidelines for the Acadian Forest." The primary product will be a
practical field guide to help landowners, foresters and contractors make better
field decisions regarding biomass retention levels with respect to soils, forest
biodiversity and water quality.

BRIEF: Shimkus to helm subcommittee

BYLINE: Jacksonville Journal-Courier, Ill.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 221 words


Dec. 20--Congressman John Shimkus has been chosen to lead a new subcommittee
when the House convenes in January.

The Illinois Republican will be at the helm of the Subcommittee on Environment
and Economy and House Energy and Commerce Committee. Chairman Fred Upton of
Michigan made the appointment this week.

"I look forward to tackling the challenging issues before us, such as safe water
and nuclear waste, which have been priorities of mine for years," Shimkus said.

Upton is splitting the current Energy and Environment Subcommittee jurisdiction
into two separate subcommittees -- Energy and Power, which will oversee energy
and Clean Air Act issues, and Environment and Economy, which will focus upon
environmental regulations and their economic impact.

In addition to the Safe Water Drinking Act and nuclear waste, Shimkus'
subcommittee will have jurisdiction over the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, Superfund, toxic substances, noise pollution and more.

 SUBJECT: Notification Pursuant to 40 C.RR. Part 266, Subpart N; VHWMR §
7-109(b)(2)



 On March 23, 2016, we notified (the "Notification") your office that,
consistent with Subpart N

 of 40 C.F.R. Part 266, as incorporated into the State of Vermont's Resource
Conservation and

 Recovery Act program pursuant to VHWMR § 7-109(b)(2) (collectively, the "Mixed
Waste

 Rule"), Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC ("Entergy VY") claimed the
conditional

 exemption for the onsite storage and treatment of low level mixed waste
("LLMW").

 Entergy's Notification was based on its conservative assessment that LLMW could
be generated

 as a result of the planned disassembly and demolition of the building commonly
known as the

 North Warehouse at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station in Vernon, Vermont.


 Specifically, the Notification reflected Entergy's expectation that certain
North Warehouse

 structural components could include hazardous materials, in addition to
radiological materials,

 and therefore constitute LLMW as a result of that structure's age, Entergy VY's
laboratory

 analysis showing lead-based paint on structural steel, and the use of that
building for storage of

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC")-authorized materials.

 In expectation of the North Warehouse disassembly and demolition (expected to
commence in

 mid-November), Entergy retained a leading national consultant, Haley & Aldrich,
Inc. ("H&A"),

 to analyze representative building components (including siding, roofing and
caulking) from the

 North Warehouse. H&A focused on reasonably anticipated contaminants, e.g.,
RCRA-8 metals,

 PCBs and asbestos. H&A's analysis determined that no relevant regulatory
thresholds for

 hazardous materials or waste handling are exceeded for these North Warehouse
components.

 Given the absence of a hazardous component, the North Warehouse building
materials slated for

 disassembly and demolition are no longer considered to be, or treated as, LLMW.
Instead, the

 North Warehouse disassembly and demolition now will be managed under applicable
NRC

 mandates related to radiological materials. Lighting bulbs and ballast
materials have been treated

 separately as universal waste.

 In light of this information, Entcrgy VY hereby respectfully withdraws its
Notification related to

 on-sitc storage and treatment of the North Warehouse dated March 23, 2016.

 Please contact Joe Lynch (802-451-3160) or me (802-451-3196) if you have any

Court to mull state's right to punish federal agencies

BYLINE: Anne Willette

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 319 words


A state's right to punish the federal government for environmental violations
will be argued Tuesday before the Supreme Court.

At issue: Ohio's right to penalize the Department of Energy for a host of
environmental problems at its Fernald nuclear processing plant near Cincinnati.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in June 1990 that Ohio can
collect fines for violations of state water pollution and federal hazardous
waste laws.

''It's important to punish the Department of Energy for its wrongdoing at
Fernald,'' says Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher, who will argue the case before
the court.

Congress gave states the right to sue federal agencies to force compliance with
the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, which regulates
waste treatment and disposal. But the Bush administration and Ohio disagree on
whether those laws let states levy fines.

Thirty states have joined Ohio in asking the Supreme Court to affirm their
authority to fine federal agencies.

''Without the sanction of civil penalties, states will be hamstrung in their
ability to compel federal agencies to comply with the law,'' the states said in
a court brief.

The administration argues that states may collect penalties only when a court
orders a federal agency to follow pollution laws and it fails to do so.

For 36 years, the government processed uranium for its nuclear weapons program
at the 1,050-acre Fernald site.  The plant generated hundreds of thousands of
tons of chemical and radioactive waste. By the DOE's own admission, the waste
has contaminated the ground water, leached into soil and been released into the
air.

In 1986, Ohio sued the DOE for breaking water pollution and hazardous waste
laws. The parties settled the lawsuit's pollution issues in 1988 by negotiating
a compliance plan that put the state in charge and is enforced by a federal
district court.

CUTLINE: OHIO PLANT: Fernald officials said the plant, closed in 1989, could not
meet safety/environmental compliance.

BOTANICAL GARDEN CHIEF RAVEN LAMENTS AMERICA'S INACTION ON THE ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: Jon Sawyer

SECTION: NEWS, Pg. A9

LENGTH: 569 words


The Missouri Botanical Garden's Peter Raven was in Washington this past week to
mark the last of his 12 years as home secretary of the National Academy of
Sciences, and so perhaps it was natural to find him in a reflective, summing-up
sort of mood.

At 62, he's as driven as ever, of course, not just with the garden, but with new
responsibilities as chairman of the National Geographic's committee on research
and exploration and of the biodiversity panel of the President's Council of
Advisers on Science and Technology.

Yet, in an hour-long chat with reporters of the Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau,
Raven suggested that on the critical environmental issues he has championed for
nearly half a century, the world is treading water.

He rattles off the dismal facts:

* The world has lost 25 percent of its topsoil in the past 50 years, 20 percent
of its arable land. "Food production has gone up, yes, but only because we're
spending our principal, not living off the interest," he said.

* "We're 4.5 percent of the world's population, using 25 percent of the world's
economy," he said. We have the lowest tax rates of any of the advanced
industrialized democracies; we contribute the least, proportionately, to
international aid.

* U.S. spending on energy conservation and alternative energy sources is just 15
percent what it was 20 years ago.

Our highways are clogged with colossal, gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles
that would have been unimaginable then, back when two oil shocks in the space of
a decade had stunned Americans into an awareness, at least temporarily, that the
world's resources were both finite and precious.

Today, Washington is flummoxed when it comes even to following up on what Raven
considers the exceedingly weak provisions of the 1997 Kyoto treaty on global
warming. The United States signed the treaty, supposedly committing us to
gradual reductions in the emission of carbon dioxide. Nothing has happened
since.

"Here's the deal on that," he said. "You have an administration that's fully
aware of the problem. You have a Congress that's totally unwilling to deal with
it."

Raven quotes one industrialist as saying that American businesses accustomed to
turning on a dime as they adjust to new trends are for some reason locked here
in denial, despite "a totally unexceptionable trend that global warming is under
way." Another says America's go-slow response probably means that Japan and
Europe will end up developing the technology -- and reaping the profits -- on
the new environmental controls that are surely headed our way.

Why is the richest country in the history of the world, the country with the
greatest possible interest in stabilizing the world's consumption of resources,
proceeding as if present trends could continue indefinitely, that tomorrow will
never come?

It is, Raven suggests, a puzzle.

"We've become introverted and self-directed, to a frightening degree, and we've
pulled in our horns," he said. "People are so invested in the next five, 10
years, in our own national and regional and personal welfare."

What he would like to see is a return to focus on the greater good, the sense of
"let's improve the world and make it better" that animated U.S. leadership just
after World War II.

"There was an element of self-interest then, too," he said. "But, on the whole,
it was a lot more elevating than now."

Boycott of oil firm sought over plan to drill near park

BYLINE: KEVIN COX; The Globe and Mail

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 492 words


Two major environmental groups are asking their members to cut up their
 Shell gasoline credit cards to protest against the company's decision to
 drill a natural gas well in a wilderness area near Waterton Lakes National
 Park.

The Alberta Wilderness Association, representing 2,500
 environmentalists and the Sierra Club of Canada, with about the same
 number of members, yesterday called for the boycott after the Alberta
 Energy Resources Conservation Board approved the drilling of the sour gas
 well, about five kilometres north of the boundaries of the national park.

The environmentalists say the well drilling will open up the area to
 poachers who will eliminate the grizzly bears and bighorn sheep. As well,
 they say the presence of hydrogen sulphide in the gas could produce well
 blow-outs that would endanger hikers and campers in nearby parkland areas.

''This is one more threat to Waterton Lakes, (the Canadian park, in the
 Rocky Mountains, is linked with Glacier National Park in Montana) an area
 that Parks Canada says is the most threatened in Canada," Doug Kariel,
 spokesman for the Sierra Club said.

''Shell will not be a good corporate citizen if they proceed with this
 well."

He said the Canadian branch of the Sierra Club will also be asking the
 350,000 members of the club around the world to join the protest, as well
 as groups such as the World Wildlife Fund.

Janet Rowley, spokesman for Shell, said the company is ''disappointed"
 the environmental groups are calling for the boycott.

''All positions were heard by the board and the well was approved. I
 don't know what else we could have done."

She stressed that Shell is only talking about drilling one exploratory
 well in the area and has not planned large-scale gas drilling in the
 Waterton area.

Vivian Pharis, head of the wilderness association, said the energy
 board's decision to approve the well was based on the same political
 considerations that led the provincial Government to rezone the
 mountainous areas to allow petroleum development.

Two earlier applications by Shell to drill near Waterton had been
 turned down by the provincial Government because the area was supposed to
 be part of a proposed provincial park.

''The Energy Resources Conservation Board never makes a decision in
 favor of the environment," she said. ''The ERCB has never turned down a
 well application for environmental reasons."

The wilderness association plans to appeal the board decision to the
 provincial Cabinet.

An association official said the group has tried unsuccessfully to set
 up a meeting with Premier Donald Getty about the development.

The energy board, in its decision, said that Shell had an adequate
 emergency measures program in the case of a blow-out and the effects of
 the development on wildlife and recreation in the area would be minimal.

Under the decision, Shell cannot begin drilling in the area until it
 has completed testing on a well in a similar geological structure in
 British Columbia.

Nitrogen limitation

SECTION: Features

LENGTH: 116 words


From Mr Andrew Stobart

Sir, For many years British agriculture has suffered from importing more energy
than it exports, and a large proportion of this has been nitrogen fertilisers
(letters, April 8, 10). It is now technically feasible, and is being
investigated in other countries, to make one's own fertilisers on the farm,
using natural energy such as water and wind to create an electric spark to
oxydise nitrogen. In addition, work has been done in the past in the UK on using
electric current, again from renewable energy sources, instead of fertilisers.

Yours faithfully,

Green Homes Could Revolutionalise Local Real Estate Industry

BYLINE: Julius Bizimungu

LENGTH: 539 words


Rwanda is promoting a 'green' economy under its medium-term development
blueprint to ensure the country develops in a sustainable manner that encourages
resource conservation, as well environmental protection to ensure sustainable
growth.

This approach also involves construction of environmentally-friendly green homes
and use of renewable energy sources, among others. The green economy is one of
the targets Rwanda seeks to achieve under the second Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS II) that runs up to 2018.

This concept has attracted attention from some firms, like Horizon Group, which
is working on ways to create awareness among Rwandans about the benefits of
green living. Horizon, in partnership with the National Fund for Climate Change
and Environment (FONERWA), will on Thursday launch the study findings on
construction of environmentally-friendly green homes in Rwanda.

Eugene Haguma, the Horizon Group chief executive officer, said in a statement
that the firm has been undertaking studies to incorporate resource-efficient
technologies into the construction of green homes in Rwanda.

"The studies focused on resource conservation for sustainability, including
sustainable low impact water management, renewable energy, land-use efficiency
and green home design.

"With the aim of pioneering the green city concept as enshrined in EDPRS II,
Horizon Group has dedicated 13 hectares of her prime land in Kinyinya, Gasabo
District toward the construction of the Cactus Green Park," said Haguma in the
statement.

He noted that the Cactus Green Park could revolutionise Rwanda's residential
housing industry.

"The development is expected to pioneer building technologies, design elements
and resource management, infrastructure that provides a neighbourhood, where the
harmony between the constructed spaces and the environment will provide great
visual and lifetime value of unmatched quality of life," he noted.

Cactus Green Park project

The project on a 13.7-hectare piece of land in Kinyinya will have a total of 349
units; the dwelling units will be distributed in 137 buildings, Haguma said. The
large central part of the plot will be open, with trees and shrubs. Multiple
green pockets, which exude a potent freshness, will be created to promote
intimate house clusters, and to reduce car movements, and rain water flowing
down at high velocity across the site.

Haguma said the project will have facilities such as a neighbourhood centre,
school, and communal green space for sports, and a waste water treatment plant.

It also includes 'green' architecture with emphasis on low carbon, locally-made
materials and low-built areas.

Only 59 per cent of the plot area will be built on, while the rest will be open
green space, and plants and water bodies.

The 'green' economy approach under EDPRS II is geared at economic
transformation, development of sustainable cities and villages, and key
innovations. It includes piloting a green city, piloting a model mine, and
attracting investors in green construction with the focus on green urbanisation
and promoting green innovation in industry and the private sector.

Haguma said these are some of the issues that guided the green homes study.

  A $4-billion project is closer to construction after the Alberta Energy
Resources Conservation Board recommended approval of the plan by Syncrude
Canada Ltd. to expand its oil sands plant in Fort McMurray, Alta.

The recommendation clears a hurdle from the path of a development
forecast to employ up to 7,000 construction tradesmen and create 1,400
permanent plant operating jobs.

The board's report is expected to be released next week in a high-
profile announcement by the Alberta Cabinet, which has final say on the
project but is also a part-owner of Syncrude and a keen backer of the
expansion plan.

The recommendation follows about 15 months of extensive studies by the
Syncrude Expansion Review Group , a special agency set up to review
environmental, technical and community issues posed by the project.

Along with the resources conservation board, the group included company
officials, the region's Fort MacKay Indian band and representatives of the
Environment Department and the Forestry, Lands and Wildlife Department.

The Cabinet is not being urged to put special conditions on the
Syncrude approval, although monitoring is anticipated for emissions, land-
surface disturbances and social effects of the giant project.

The development would raise production by the combination strip-mining
and bitumen-upgrading complex to 230,000 barrels daily, or more than 16
per cent of Canada's total output.

Syncrude, a seven-company consortium with the Alberta Government along
as a partner, plans to decide whether to go ahead on construction as soon
as early 1989.

The decision depends on oil prices, plus tax and royalty arrangements
to be negotiated with the federal and provincial governments.

The Oklahoma Sierra Club on Tuesday added SandRidge Exploration and Production
Inc. to a federal lawsuit regarding earthquakes.

The petition asks the court to order an immediate reduction in oil and gas
wastewater injected into the ground.

The lawsuit was filed in February and named Chesapeake Operating LLC, Devon
Energy Production Co. and New Dominion LLC. The petition cites the citizen
lawsuit provision of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or
RCRA. The drilling companies put Oklahoma residents in immediate risk from
human-induced earthquakes, according to the lawsuit.

The Sierra Club identified SandRidge Energy Inc. 's subsidiary as part of the
lawsuit in November, when the environmental organization filed an intent to sue,
required by RCRA's citizen lawsuit provisions. The driller's subsidiary was not
named in the February petition.

A hearing date has not been set before Judge Stephen P. Friot in the federal
court district in the Western District of Oklahoma.

OMAN SETS JULY CRUDE

AT $ 15.21 A BARREL

TOKYO - Oman has set its retroactive July crude oil price at $ 15.21 a barrel,
down $ 1.25 from the price it charged its term customers for June barrels, a
source at Oman's Ministry of Petroleum and Mining said Tuesday.

The June retroactive price was $ 16.46 a barrel.

Traders pointed out that Abu Dhabi also reduced the July price of its main
Murban crude grade by $ 1.25 from the June level.  UTILITIES GROUP PRAISES

EPA DECISION ON ASH WASHINGTON - Coal-burning utilities are relieved that the
Environmental Protection Agency has authorized the use of fly ash, boiler ash
and smokestack-scrubber waste in recycling, the Edison Electric Institute said
Tuesday.

The federal agency had been considering whether such byproducts of burning might
be hazardous wastes as defined by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

Had the EPA classified such wastes as dangerous, electric utilities would have
had to stop supplying fly ash as a Portland cement substitute. That practice
avoided 1.3 million tons of emissions from coal combustion, said the Edison
Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities.  OPEC BASKET
PRICE

INCREASED LAST WEEK LONDON - The price of OPEC's basket of seven crudes rose to
$ 16.11 a barrel last week, compared with $ 15.79 in the third week of July, the
OPEC News Agency reported Monday.

According to figures released by the OPEC Secretariat Monday, this year's price
of the basket, through Friday, has averaged $ 17.39.

For the month of July, the basket price stood at an average of $ 15.95, compared
with $ 17.11 in June and $ 17.89 in May.

The OPEC basket comprises Algeria's Saharan Blend, Indonesia's Minas, Nigeria's
Bonny Light, Saudi Arabia's Arabian Light, Dubai of the United Arab Emirates,
Venezuela's Tia Juana and non-OPEC Mexico's Isthmus crude.

Total SA oil sands ambitions hit snag;
Judge temporarily halts review hearing into French energy giant's plan for
100,000-barrels-a-day project

DATELINE: CALGARY


A coalition of environmental groups has delivered a setback to Total SA, after a
judge temporarily halted a review hearing into the French energy giant's plans
to build a new oil sands mine.

A joint review panel decided to delay the hearing late Tuesday, on the first day
of its examination of the Joslyn North Mine, after critics argued that the
company's environmental assessment filings were inadequate. "The joint panel
adjourned the hearing to deliberate upon a number of important and complex
rulings on matters, including questions of constitutional law and filings of
information," Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board said in a statement.

The panel expects to rule on those matters next Monday and reconvene "no earlier
than" Tuesday, the ERCB said.

"We understand that the hearing is a thorough process, and that the panel has to
consider several complex issues before the hearing can continue," said Gary
Houston, a Total vice-president. "We remain confident in our project and look
forward to presenting it to the joint review panel and to the public when the
hearing resumes."

The decision comes as a victory to groups who believe the company's
environmental assessment did not adequately address the proposed mine's
cumulative effects.

"We are confident the panel will instruct Total to conduct a proper cumulative
impact assessment," said Simon Dyer, the oil sands program director for the
Pembina Institute.

Oil sands projects are required to study the impact of their own proposed work
in combination with other development activities in the area in which they plan
to operate.

In a motion filed Tuesday, the Oil Sands Environmental Coalition argued that
Total didn't properly examine the potential impact of forest fires or lumber
harvesting in the area it plans to mine. The groups also accuse Total of failing
to account for the potential additional disturbance that might come from two
other nearby oil sands projects - Frontier and Equinox - although both projects
remain at a very early stage.

The coalition is made up Pembina, the Toxics Watch Society of Alberta and the
Fort McMurray Environmental Association.

Total bought a 75-per-cent interest in the Joslyn project, which would produce
100,000 barrels of oil a day, in 2005.

Deregulation isn't heaven

BYLINE: John DeMont

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 15, OIL ACTION

LENGTH: 343 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  ITS STILL EARLY in the game, but price deregulation initially hasn't been the
cure-all the Western oil industry had expected.

Just ask the Alberta producers who are being forced to shut in 152,000 barrels
per day of light and medium crude oil production for the month of August. With
light crude fetching around $36.50 a barrel these days, this could cost the
industry about $5.5 million daily in lost revenues.

Ironically, deregulation of the industry (which officially took place June 1) is
partially to blame. Subsequent market uncertainties, coupled with a declining
world oil price, have left much of Alberta's production priced too high to
compete in key U.S. markets.

In such a situation - when sales contracts aren't large enough to keep all
Alberta wells producing at optimum rates - the province's Energy Resources
Conservation Board moves in with a heavy hand. The ERCB limits the production of
each of the 600-or-so companies that produce oil in Alberta.

LACKS CAPACITY

Once Canadian prices fall enough to compete with U.S. crude, demand is expected
to recover. But that doesn't mean Alberta producers will be entirely out of the
woods. When the province's 17,600 oil wells are producing at capacity,
Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. (the transporter of Western oil to Eastern Canada)
lacks the capacity to accommodate all the crude.

IPL has been walking a fine line for a number of months trying to balance
capacity and demand. As a long-term solution, it has started a two-phase
$114-million expansion of its system. This will add 200,000 barrels per day to
capacity.

The expansion will take 18 months. In the meantime, crude volumes are expected
to start rising once Canadian prices adapt to the new environment. Some new
production has also come on stream. Esso Resources Canada Ltd.'s Cold Lake and
Norman Wells projects should add an estimated 45,000 b/d to the system by the
end of the summer. As a result, IPL will need some magic to prevent additional
production cut-backs in the months ahead.

Major companies dropping out of western drilling

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 16, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 1022 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  A tantalizing clue to the pattern of Canadian oil field investment has cropped
up in a ''snapshot'' table prepared by the Independent Petroleum Association of
Canada in late July.

The association did a count of companies applying to the Energy Resources
Conservation Board in the months of May 1985, 1988 and 1989 for licenses to
drill new wells.

The informal census demonstrates decisively that, over the five-year period, the
initiative to instigate drilling programs in Canada has shifted from the major
companies (ie: nonindependent integrated companies and senior producers) to the
independent Canadian exploration and production firms.

Here is the important background to the association's findings.

Activity in 1985 and 1988 was the best in the decade; 1989 has been the worst
year, with drilling at 1977 levels.

The association grouped the companies making the applications into major
(independent) and independent categories.

The majors included Canadian-based Gulf Canada Resources, Home Oil, Husky Oil,
Norcen Energy Resources, PanCanadian Petroleum and Petro-Canada.

The multinationals in the nonindependent group are Amoco Canada/Dome Petroleum,
BP Canada, Esso Resources/Texaco Canada, Canadian Occidental Petroleum, Chevron
Canada Resources, Mobil Oil, Shell Oil and Suncor Inc.

According to the association's count, in May 1985, these firms obtained 392
licenses, 61% of the 643 licenses issued by the board.

In May 1988,however, the nonindependents took down only 125 (25%) of the 501
licenses issued, while the independents received 376 licenses (75%).

And in May this year, the independents applied for 230 of the 268 licenses
issued - an 86% role in initiating new drilling. In June, the independents
licensed 218 new wells, 73% of the 299 new locations in the province.

This is not a statistically sophisticated sampling. And it doesn't represent a
delineation of investment dollars because it doesn't assess the relative costs
of the wells involved.

Nor does it fully explain the role of independents and majors, because it
doesn't report who the partners are in each well. Few wells are drilled by a
single company.

However, the profile does fit a widely acknowleged pattern.

The majors are no longer the leaders in oil and gas drilling in western Canada.
Their investment focus is now on the frontiers and in heavy oil and the oil
sands.

They are still an important factor in conventional drilling but in a fairly
passive role - they are farming out prospects to the independents or drilling
only to hold on to prime properties for which their rights are otherwise due to
expire.

The absence of drilling for heavy oil and in situ oil sands projects has been a
major component in this year's slump in oil field activity by the nonindependent
companies.

The price for heavier grades of oil has fallen severely; existing projects
aren't being expanded and new ones aren't being taken on.


As well, some multiwell shallow gas drilling plans which had been expected from
the nonindependent group, particularly in Saskatchewan, have failed to
materialize.

Meanwhile, the reduction of activity in Canada by major U.S.-controlled
companies fits a bigger pattern. The parent companies have also reduced their
investment in American properties, switching resources to exploration and
development outside the continent.

In very rough terms, for 1989, half the total exploration and production budget
of US$100 billion expended by U.S.-based companies will be spent in foreign
countries.

Some of the major Canadian firms, Norcen Energy Resources for example, are also
heavily focused on foreign drilling.

In the U.S., the shift could reverse itself to some degree, if Congress and
President George Bush were to allow the industry on to federal leases offshore
California, Florida and Alaska and in the onshore Alaskan wildlife range.

Drilling in all these areas is the subject of an intensive
environmental-protection debate that will probably drag on for years.

Denying the U.S. oil and natural gas industry access to these areas in effect
denies it the opportunity to explore for the best remaining elephant-scale
prospects in the U.S.

This reduces opportunities for the largest U.S. firms because they are driven to
find the biggest, new, available fields, to make large-scale reserves
replacements.

Meanwhile, the American oil patch is working hard to get a new system of
drilling incentives from the federal government.

A bill which will deregulate wellhead natural gas prices is working its way
through Congress, and will get presidential approval. This is a significant
nonfiscal initiative to stimulate field investment

Beyond that is a tax-driven program of incentives for investment in oil and gas
exploration and development. The political driver for this measure is America's
emerging oil-import crisis.


Probably before the end of this year, the U.S. will experience a month in which
more that half its oil consumption is supplied from outside the country for the
first time.

A key, unanswered question is the applicability of a new incentive package on
the foreign investments of the U.S. oil industry.

In the past, international oil and gas investments by Americans were given the
benefit of U.S. tax relief. In fact, writeoffs against U.S. income tax were a
major incentive for the multinationals who lead the hunt for oil and gas in
western Canada from 1947 to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
crisis of 1973.

It is possible, even probable, that Congress and Bush will want the new
incentives to draw investment back into the U.S., and will restrict application
of the federal measures to field activity in the U.S.

And it is highly unlikely that a new U.S. incentive program would be any more
generous than Ottawa's Canadian Exploration Expenditure and Canadian Development
Expenditure writeoffs.

In spite of those two programs available in Canada, a new U.S. incentive plan
may perhaps drain even more investment from this country's oil and gas fields.

False trap of fuel test

BYLINE: The Canberra Times

SECTION: A; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 977  words


There is a looming political dilemma for the Rudd Government on whether petrol
should be included in its emissions trading scheme and thus subject to an extra
charge as a way to lower greenhouse emissions.

In principle such a scheme should cover the widest feasible range of emissions,
to spread the burden of lowering emissions as widely as possible. Therefore
there will be tremendous pressure on the Government to include petrol both the
2007 report to the Howard government, and Ross Garnaut recently, have emphasised
a wide inclusion of emissions. This will be seen by many as a test of how
seriously the Rudd Government takes the global warming threat.

On the other hand, given the approach taken so far the by the Opposition on
petrol prices, and on petrol and the emissions trading scheme, we can expect the
mother of all populist outrage campaigns if petrol is included. This could be
politically damaging to the Government, and cast a big shadow over carrying the
community along in meeting the challenge of global warming. But the test of how
strong the Government is on global warming is false, and there are principled
reasons why the dilemma can be avoided, by not including petrol.

The first reason is that, alone among fossil-fuel use in Australia, oil used for
transport is already subject to a heavy resource conservation and environmental
tax. This is the petrol excise, fixed at 38.143c a litre for petrol and diesel
passenger cars.

(Trucks pay 19.633cs a litre, and off- road fuel, for agriculture and mining for
instance, pays no excise). The history of these heavy taxes on road transport
fuel is that, after the oil shocks of the 1970s, governments in almost every
wealthy country realised how vulnerable they were, and for energy security
reasons decided they needed to be far less reliant on oil imports. They
reinforced existing fuel taxes. These taxes worked, and underpinned increased
efficiency in the use of oil in many countries. As a result, oil use per capita
in wealthy European countries is about half of the United States. It has been
plausibly argued that this far more efficient use of oil in the developed world
except the US actually delayed by years the present crunch of supply and demand.
It is an enormously wise form of tax.

As well as resource conservation and efficiency incentives, these taxes
increasingly came to be recognised as powerful environmental measures. Less
petrol use has meant less noise, congestion and air pollution, and fewer
crashes. Thus Australia already has a significant environmental tax on oil use
by cars, our only carbon tax on fossil fuel.

(One of the justifications for taxes on petrol has been that it funds road
spending. However, given the high level of excise on car petrol compared with
fuel for trucks, it is clear that a great deal of the 38c excise can only be
seen as an environmental tax.) By comparison, early charges under the emissions
trading scheme would be much smaller than this. If there were a low initial
emission permit price of $10 a tonne of CO2, or a medium price of $30 (about the
current European permit price), the charge per litre of petrol would be about
2.5c or 7.5c.

Secondly, an emissions charge at these initial lower levels won't alter
behaviour much, so won't lessen emissions much. Although the European experience
shows higher costs can greatly lower petrol use in the long term, it takes time
and heavier costs to alter private petrol use behaviour. For instance, compare
the costs of an additional 7.5c a litre per average car for a year, of about
$100, with the cost of buying even a small fuel-efficient new car ($15,000?) or
the cost of moving house or changing jobs with lower travel costs in mind.

Private use of oil is quite different, therefore, from use of oil by industries
and commercial users, who are much more likely to alter their behaviour and be
more efficient, because of price changes of the order likely under the emissions
trading scheme. The general lesson is that market measures such as an emissions
trading scheme (or its mirror image, a carbon tax) need to be mixed with quite
different regulatory and incentive measures where market measures alone aren't
the best way of getting emission reductions.

Thirdly, because a small initial emissions trading scheme charge on petrol won't
achieve reductions in emissions, exclusion of private petrol use won't shift a
heavier reduction burden on to other emissions sources. Petrol paying the 38c a
litre excise only contributes about 8 per cent of emissions. Exclusion of petrol
from the scheme will mean less revenue collected, but also lower the level of
the compensation obligation to households. The way to proceed would be for
petrol and diesel paying the 38c excise (less than half the oil used in
Australia) to be excluded from the scheme for the first few years, but all other
oil included. (The alternative approach of including petrol but lowering the
excise is unworkable because it can't be predicted beforehand what the price of
emissions under the scheme will be, so an equal excise reduction figure can't be
predicted.)

At the same time, a massive policy package to drive reduced private petrol use
would be needed, covering incentives, infrastructure and changes in regulation,
for more efficient cars and other forms of fuel- efficient transport such as
motor scooters and small motorbikes, bicycles, walking and public transport.
This could be funded from revenue from the scheme. These changes will be greatly
helped by the ever-higher world price of oil.

Petrol is not included under the European emissions trading scheme, there are
good arguments for both inclusion and exclusion of petrol, and there is no need
for the Rudd Government to be trapped in a false test on the issue of petrol and
its scheme.

Paul Pollard is a Canberra environmental economist and town planner.

NEWSFLASH, KEN KOWALSKI- CALGARY HAS PIGS, GAS WELLS

BYLINE: DON BRAID

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; ASSIGNMENT CALGARY; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 525 words


It's clear from the latest chapter in the Ken Kowalski saga (working title:
"Dumb and Dumber") that the former deputy premier never met Winston the Pig.

Kowalski launched the oddest quote of his verbally-challenged career when he
said: "The last time I looked I never saw one ounce of oil, one litre of gas,
one cow, one pig, one chicken, one foot of timber, in Calgary."

I take exception to all of this, particularly the slur aimed at Calgary's
law-abiding population of Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.

One of them, Winston, is pictured here. (He's the fellow in the hat.)

Winston lived happily with Northwest resident Jill Downton and her husband until
this week, when he finally topped 250 pounds and outgrew the family kitchen.

Near tears, the family shipped the urban porker off to a farm in Sundre, where
he will presumably win more favor with Kowalski as a purely rural animal.

"It was getting a bit crowded," says Jill Downton. "He liked to sleep by the
door, so we had to climb over him whenever we came into the kitchen."

This should enlighten Kowalski, who may have thought Winston's relatives were
all at the trough in Barrhead.

Chickens? Calgary has those too, notably a pair that inhabit a yard near 12th
Avenue and Edmonton Trail N.E.

Calgary's inner-city chickens tend to vary sharply in number, especially around
dinnertime.

Cows? Horses? Other livestock?

You'll find them lowing, neighing, baa-ing and oinking at more than 40 working
farms inside the city limits.

These farms are spread from the far northeast to the southeast and southwest.

They are so obvious, both to the eye and the nose, that the city has a special
committee to handle their musky relations with growing suburbs.

Kowalski missed all this, which isn't surprising, since he's also unaware of one
of Calgary's best-known sights -- the bronco-buster oil wells alongside the
runways at the airport.

To see them, a flyer only needs to be conscious.

There are at least three working oil wells within the city limits, as well as 20
natural gas wells, some producing sour gas that causes controversy in the
northeast.

These facts come from the Energy Resources Conservation Board, the agency
Kowalski almost got to run after he was kicked out of cabinet last year.

That was a near miss. Ask questions about Kowalski over at the ERCB, and you can
still hear their gusty sighs of relief.

"You don't win any points with dumb comments like this," says Mayor Al Duerr.

"We've got everything in Calgary -- oil wells, gas wells and farms.

"The one thing we don't have, unfortunately, is a hospital under construction."

Doug Mitchell, president of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, adds his opinion of
Kowalski: "I think he's just lost it."

When Kowalski was still important, he made many visits to Calgary. How did the
Great Rural Helmsman miss all the obvious echoes of country life?

Maybe he spent too much time downtown at McDougall Centre, where there is no
risk whatever of getting your shiny shoes soiled.

What downturn? Oil sands production climbs 14% in 2009

BYLINE: DAWN WALTON

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ENERGY; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 503 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Oil sands production jumped a surprising 14 per cent in 2009 despite unstable
crude prices, economic turmoil and a broad pullback from the Fort McMurray
region.

Last year, the Alberta oil sands pumped out 1.49 million barrels a day - or 544
million barrels for the year - of raw crude bitumen, according to a new annual
report published by the province's Energy Resources Conservation Board over the
weekend.

Although some companies were putting the brakes on oil sands projects in 2009
amid economic uncertainty - the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said
capital expenditures fell to $10-billion compared with $18.1-billion in 2008 -
production from players that established themselves in the region during the
boom was largely credited for an increase in production.

Growing mine production from Suncor Energy Inc. and Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd. was a key contributor to that increase.

And despite the downturn in recent quarters, the ERCB predicts the province's
annual bitumen production will jump to 3.2 million barrels a day - or 1.2
billion barrels a year - by 2019. Over the same period, the board expects
investment in the oil sands to total $148-billion.

Meanwhile, Alberta saw an 8.6-per-cent reduction in its conventional oil
production last year compared with 2008. In 2009, the industry produced 461,300
barrels a day or 169 million barrels for the year.

Natural gas, which has fuelled much of Alberta's economy over the years but has
suffered from depressed prices, continued its freefall.

Alberta produced four trillion cubic feet of conventional natural gas last year,
which marked an 8.9-per-cent drop for 2008 production, according to the report.
The ERCB forecasts that the number of new conventional gas wells will drop 26
per cent in 2010 to 2,800.

The regulator pegged Alberta's total remaining established bitumen and
conventional oil reserves at 171.3 billion barrels.

The bulk is found in the oil sands where established bitumen is estimated at
169.9 billion barrels, while conventional oil reserves make up 1.4 billion
barrels.

Darin Barter, a spokesman with the ERCB, said that with such an "enormous
volume" in the province, exploration costs are now "zero."

"We know the oil is there, the bitumen is there, the technology may not be
there, but we all know how quickly technology moves forward when there is a
financial reward at the end," Mr. Barter said.

For the first time, the ERCB included the Grosmont deposit in northern Alberta,
worth an estimated 406 billion barrels, in its data, which helped push up
in-place bitumen by 28 per cent.

Although the deposit is not yet producing, the industry is working nearby and
getting close to tapping it, according to the board.

"As projects come on stream, what it does is, it proves the resources," Mr.
Barter said.

The board projects investment in conventional oil and gas extraction as well as
unconventional non-oil sands, such as coal bed methane and heavy oil extraction,
to ring in at $14-billion annually.

GAS PRODUCERS RALLY TO BACK NEW PIPELINE

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 667 words


**GRAPHIC ACCOMPANYING TEXT NOT INCLUDED**

After setting their fifth straight annual sales record, Alberta natural gas
exporters are rallying to support completion of a project to push their
deliveries to the United States even higher.

An overwhelming majority of the industry is teaming up to defeat a bid to halt
expansion by the Alberta-to-California pipeline of Alberta Natural Gas Co.,
Pacific Gas Transmission Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

That majority is out to save an estimated $ 23.3 billion worth of new gas sales
over the next 20 years, by keeping alive construction of $ 1.6 billion US in
American facilities and $ 344 million Cdn in new delivery capacity in Canada.

The California project spells a 15 per cent jump in gas exports to keep up the
surge that raised them to two trillion cubic feet last year - or double the best
performance achieved even in the 1970s energy boom. The new deliveries are
scheduled to start Nov. 1.

But the gains would be uneven. The bid to halt the project is led by losers of
last year's race for U.S. and Canadian government approvals for new California
facilities, Altamont Gas Transmission Co. and Amoco Canada Petroleum Co.

Altamont, a consortium led by Texas giant Tenneco Gas, deferred its project last
year after losing regulatory battles. Amoco, a part-owner of Altamont, booked no
delivery capacity on the winning ANG-Pacific Gas system.

The forum for the new battle in the California pipeline war will be hearings
that Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board has called for next week.

In a bid to reverse defeats before the National Energy Board and Washington's
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Amoco and Altamont are appealing to the
ERCB to stop the last stage of the transportation megaproject.

The ERCB is being asked to deny approval to a small but key part of the plan: $
120 million in facilities that Nova Corp. has applied to add to its Alberta
gas-gathering pipelines, as essential to fill the new California capacity.

Construction is about 75 per cent completed along the Pacific Gas route across
Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California to the Los Angeles area.

Preliminary work is under way on ANG's leg from Alberta across southeastern
British Columbia. For spring construction, ANG awarded a $ 20-million order
Tuesday for 21,650 tonnes of pipe to Camrose Pipe Co.

The last-ditch attack on Nova's leg in the project drew a flood of protests.
While the hearings may become a long review of California markets, the project's
backers have made it plain in writing to the ERCB that they will not change.

The supporters include Western Gas Marketing Ltd., sales agent for more than 700
Alberta firms, plus production leaders such as Alberta Energy Co., Imperial Oil
Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd., PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd., Chevron Canada Resources
Ltd., Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., Suncor Inc. and North Canadian Oils Ltd.

Amoco maintains that the ANG-Pacific Gas project will be under-used because long
gas-sales contracts have so far only been lined up to fill about 40 per cent of
the new delivery capacity.

Amoco warns the result will be costly legacies of inflated shipping tolls and
price-cutting sales scrambles by other production firms that booked the new
pipeline capacity with contracts to rent it whether they use it or not.

The project's backers say they remain committed to it, to sell surpluses and
establish permanent new sales outlets that will pay off richly as the gas glut
is burned off and prices firm up in future.

PanCanadian regulatory affairs manager Robert Mackie voices the majority view by
telling the ERCB that all parties admit California is troubled now by gas
surpluses, excess pipeline capacity, regulatory confusion and economic
recession.

But confidence still prevails that California, and northwestern states also
reached by the project, will be good markets again after serving as mainstay
export outlets since the 1960s, Mackie says.

EDMONTON FIRM FINED FOR DUMPING

Canadian Liquid Air Ltd. was fined $ 30,000 in Calgary provincial court this
week after the Edmonton company pleaded guilty to dumping its calcium hydroxide
waste at a landfill site in Calgary's east end.

The Calgary police commercial crime unit earlier charged the company with a
number of offences under Calgary's waste bylaw.

The court was told Canadian Liquid Air shipped 26 loads of calcium hydroxide
weighing a total of 375,492 kilograms to the Calgary landfill site at 17th
Avenue and 68th Street S.E. between Aug. 25 and Oct. 15, 1992.

This waste, the court was told, was delivered without a valid permit authorizing
its disposal. Even though Calgary uses this waste for neutralizing acids, its
landfill sites do not accept waste generated outside the city.

MAN ON MEND AFTER STABBING INCIDENT

A city man is recovering in hospital after a stabbing early Wednesday morning in
an apartment at 3726 Centre St. N.

It was initially reported that a man had been shot, but officers discovered a
man who had been stabbed in the face, chest and hands. Police said shots had
been accidentally fired in the apartment but they missed the victim, identified
as Ernest Laratt, 28, of Calgary. He was listed in good condition in hospital.

Police said they are looking for two black males, one 42 years old, the other 30
years old.

RCMP STAMP OUT MARIJUANA CROP

Jon Charles, 36, of Bashaw, faces charges of cultivation of marijuana and
possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking after RCMP drug
investigators closed down a hydroponic operation with the potential to generate
revenue of $ 3 million a year, Red Deer RCMP reported Wednesday. RCMP said they
discovered 1,348 marijuana plants in various stages of growth Tuesday at a house
and barn about 12 kilometres southwest of Bashaw.

CREW CAPS SOUR GAS WELL FIRE

Firefighters have capped a fire at the Palmer Ranch Ltd. sour gas well 10
kilometres southeast of Twin Butte, about 250 kilometres southwest of Calgary,
the Energy Resources Conservation Board said Wednesday.

A well control crew capped the well at 5:30 p.m. after a mobile crane lifted a
blowout preventer into place and shut off the flow of gas, the ERCB said in a
release.

The well exploded Friday, fuelling four-metre-high flames from a
three-metre-wide crater. The ERCB said it now will monitor Palmer Ranch's
remedial work to prevent any more explosions.

DECISION AWAITED IN ERCB HEARING

BYLINE: ANDY MARSHALL

SECTION: CITY; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 559 words


A farmer in east-central Alberta peers anxiously through the window at the
cattle feeding outside.

More than 400 kilometres away in his downtown Calgary office, a petroleum
engineer sits quietly at his desk, a shadow of doubt dimming his view.

Although the two men have hardly spoken to each other in a year, their thoughts
are closely linked as they wait for a soon-to-be-announced decision that will
not only seal their own fates but color the relationships between Alberta's two
giant industries.

In the middle is the Energy Resources Conservation Board, the oilpatch watchdog,
eager to retain a reputation for fairness in the face of public questions about
its closeness to the energy industry.

At issue is an application by Amax Petroleum to drill additional wells on a home
section owned by dairy farmer Cy Skinner and his family near Provost.

Skinner's adamant refusal to accept more wells, based on worries about pollution
of the air and soil by the Amax operation, led to one of the longest hearings in
ERCB history, 4,000 pages of detailed testimony, and more than nine months'
delay while the board figured out a solution to the dilemma.

"This sure is dragging . . . it's mentally very frustrating," says Skinner, 36.

He's sensitive about his own and his family's health -- as well as that of his
228-head dairy herd -- because of existing Amax activities on the property.

More than $ 600,000 in bills, from calling in a battery of experts to argue his
case, add to the stress: "Watching for something to happen keeps me on the edge
all the time."

As well as hoping the board will agree to reimburse him for these expenses, he
appreciates its eventual decision "will make a big difference to the oil and
agricultural industries."

Chris Hemstock, the Amax engineer who has quarterbacked the company effort, also
acknowledges the delay preys on his mind. "It'll be nice to get back to doing
some work," he says.

An ERCB official would only say an announcement will be made "reasonably soon."

Editing of the board's written ruling is now under way, with the production of
the final report planned after that.

Adding to the stakes in the outcome is the strong interest in the proceedings by
the 35,000-member Alberta Cattle Commission.

The commission has already sent a stinging message to the ERCB with a motion
from its recent annual meeting that responsibility for investigating petroleum
industry operations be taken away from the board and be given to Alberta
Environment.

Commission president Larry Sears plays down the implications of the Skinner
case, but says "we have to learn to get along without butting heads."

While the three-man board hearing the case is extremely tight-lipped about its
findings, observers expect strong recommendations for better communication
between the petroleum industry and farmers.

"I wouldn't be surprised to see procedures change . . . to put more emphasis on
more open dialogue between them," says Amax's Hemstock.

For Mike Sawyer, a former director with the Alberta Wilderness Association and
active in the "green" movement, the delay in the ERCB decision is
understandable.

"They have to find a way to rationalize a decision that will support the (
energy) industry without hurting the illusion they are looking after the public
interest," he says.

GreenPoint Rated: California Reaches Milestone of 10,000 Green Homes

LENGTH: 796  words


New Delhi, April 10 -- With 10,000 California homes now bearing the GreenPoint
Rated label, representing the gold standard in green homes, Energy Upgrade
California in Los Angeles County has announced the availability of rebates to
help more local homeowners get a green home label. Through the end of 2012, Los
Angeles County homeowners can receive up to $2,000 from Los Angeles County to
cover the cost of getting a GreenPoint Rated label for their home.

To date, California's 10,000 GreenPoint Rated homes have saved over 112 million
gallons of water - enough to fill MacArthur Park Lake five times over - and
avoided nearly 9,000 tons of greenhouse gases, the equivalent of taking over
1,500 cars off the road for a year.

GreenPoint Rated is designed to help homeowners ensure their home is built or
remodeled to meet high environmental standards. Like a report card for green
homes, the rating system assigns points based on five categories: Energy
Efficiency, Resource Conservation, Indoor Air Quality, Water Conservation and
Community Benefits. Point values are determined based on the use of verified
green construction practices and sustainable materials that exceed California's
residential building and energy code requirements.

To ensure a home is built or remodeled to maximize efficiency and minimize
environmental impacts, GreenPoint Rated assesses points based on green building
techniques including:

* Increasing energy efficiency by implementing energy saving construction
techniques and equipment such as solar power, solar water heating and ENERGY
STAR appliances

* Conserving water with toilets, faucets, showerheads and landscaping that
require less water

* Creating healthier indoor air quality by using less toxic paint and installing
appropriate ventilation systems to reduce levels of chemicals, dust and mold

* Using reclaimed or sustainable building materials like bamboo and recycled
glass to protect forests and reduce landfill waste

* Creating livable communities, enhancing quality of life and minimizing
pollution through community benefits like proximity to public transportation,
stores and other services

Homeowners who need to make upgrades in order to qualify for a green label can
get additional rebates of up to $8,000 through Energy Upgrade California to
defray the costs of energy efficiency improvements - typically the most
intensive piece of a green home upgrade. An energy upgrade can increase a home's
efficiency by 10 to 40 percent through fixed improvements like insulation, duct
sealing and energy-efficient windows. These energy efficiency improvements can
earn a home 20 of the 25 points needed to qualify for the GreenPoint Rated
label.

"In designing our green home, we wanted to set an example of sustainability,
energy use and healthy living for our entire community," said Robert Fortunato,
owner of the Green Idea House in Hermosa Beach, Calif. "GreenPoint Rated gave us
access to a community of experts who have helped us achieve our most important
goal: creating a legacy of sustainable living for our 10-year old son."

Fortunato's home, which is the first remodel in Los Angeles County to receive
the GreenPoint Rated label this year, earned over 150 points on the label's
rating scale. While every GreenPoint Rated home is above average in terms of
sustainability and resource conservation, most homes average 88 points.

In addition to environmental benefits, homes that have been built or remodeled
using green building techniques may have lower-cost utility bills, home
maintenance and repairs. Early research also indicates that homes with a green
label may retain their value better, even in a tough real estate market, and are
attractive to a growing number of homeowners and buyers.

"A green home is good for the planet, healthier for you and your family - and
now, with these new rebates, getting the label that proves your home is green is
basically free," said Howard Choy, General Manager of the County Office of
Sustainability, which administers the Green Label Rebate Program and Energy
Upgrade California in Los Angeles County. "We hope these rebates will encourage
more Los Angeles homeowners to consider going green."

About Energy Upgrade California

Energy Upgrade California Los Angeles is administered and overseen by an
alliance among L.A. County, Southern California Edison, Southern California Gas
Company and the City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Los Angeles
County was one of the first counties in California to roll out this program.
Locally, the program provides homeowners with information on home upgrade
benefits, available financing, incentives and rebates, and help with finding
participating contractors. For more information, visit

Peace River hydro project moves ahead; Run-of-river plant approved by province
after developer addresses concerns over fish

BYLINE: Hanneke Brooymans, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 597  words


An Alberta hydroelectric project rejected by provincial regulators five years
ago has succeeded in its second attempt before a review board.

The run-of-river project on the Peace River is proposed by Glacier Power Ltd.
It's going ahead partly because of unique fish ramps designed to allow
freshwater species to move up and down the river.

"It's a huge milestone," said Kelly Matheson, environmental affairs manager for
Canadian Hydro Developers Inc., the parent company. "We're really, really
happy."

Matheson has been with the project for eight of the almost 10 years it has been
underway. It's slated to be built about 90 kilometres west of the town of Peace
River.

Unlike conventional dams, a run-of-river project does not store water to
generate power. This one intends to raise the water level by six metres at a
powerhouse then let the water run through turbines to generate energy.

The project was rejected by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the
Natural Resources Conservation Board in 2003, because of concerns about flooding
in the town of Peace River, fog on the Dunvegan Bridge, impact on fish, and
interference with the Shaftesbury ferry and ice bridge.

Matheson said the company spent three years addressing areas where the original
panel thought more information was needed. In the end, she said, it was able to
satisfy everyone except those concerned about the Shaftesbury ferry and ice
bridge.

Carolyn Chenard, lead director of Concerned Residents for Ongoing Service at
Shaftesbury, said Monday the organization was not prepared to make a statement
yet about the decision.

The project approval was announced Monday by the federal-provincial panel that
reviewed it earlier this year. The panel consisted of the Natural Resources
Conservation Board, the Alberta Utilities Commission and the Canadian
Environmental Assessment Agency.

The project has changed since its original application, from 80 megawatts to 100
megawatts. According to Alberta Energy, one megawatt of capacity is enough
supply the annual electricity needs for 1,000 homes.

The construction of the weir, powerhouse and fish ramps was initially expected
to cost $175 million. Matheson estimates the cost could now be $500 million to
$600 million. Still, the project appears to be economical, she said.

Fairview Mayor Lloyd Campbell is pleased the project finally got the go-ahead,
especially since it's expected to create 300 person-years of construction work.
It's also expected to create three to six permanent jobs.

"It's going to create some employment, and with the downturn in the economy
that's very important," he said.

Campbell said he worked for a company that did some landowner contact for
Glacier Power a number of years ago. He thought it was going to be a "slam dunk"
and was surprised that it took so long for the project to go ahead.

Matheson said the project still needs approvals from the federal Department of
Fisheries and Oceans, Alberta Environment and Alberta Sustainable Resource
Development. If all that goes ahead, construction could start in 2010.

Monday's approval, which was specifically intended to decide whether or not the
project is in the public interest, contained 21 recommendations to minimize and
manage potential impacts. Many of the panel's concerns centred around the
river's fish, which include bull trout, burbot and whitefish.

Matheson said the company will likely sell the power to other electricity
providers, who could use the renewable energy credits associated with the
project to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions.

Enbridge plans $500-million safety upgrade for Gateway

BYLINE: NATHAN VANDERKLIPPE

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; PIPELINES; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 823 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Facing widespread concern about the safety of oil pipelines, Enbridge Inc.
promised to spend up to $500-million to reinforce its planned Northern Gateway
pipeline to the British Columbia coast, while the Alberta government is
launching a broad review of industry practices in the province.

Enbridge said Friday it plans to use thicker-walled steel for delicate sections
of the planned project, including more than 100 important river crossings, and
install about 50 additional remotely operable valves that it can shut in the
event of an emergency. Together, those measures will add $400-million to
$500-million, or roughly 10 per cent, to the $5.5-billion twin-pipe project,
which would haul Alberta crude for Pacific export at Kitimat, B.C.

Opposition to Northern Gateway, particularly among first nations and
environmental groups, has hardened following a series of oil spills in Alberta
and elsewhere in North America. Enbridge believes skeptics "will be swayed by
these initiatives," said Janet Holder, the company's executive vice-president in
charge of Gateway. "This should give them further comfort that we are going well
beyond anything that's ever been done in North America with regards to pipeline
safety."

On the same day, the Alberta government ordered a pipeline safety review, after
the province experienced three substantial spills in a month earlier this year,
a confluence of events that trained public attention on how the province's
nearly 400,000 kilometres of pipe are operated.

The measures come at a critical juncture for Canada's energy future, as
companies with surging oil sands production seek new, and more lucrative,
offshore markets at a time when the industry's failings have made clear the
risks of producing and transporting those barrels.

"I'm not happy with the spills we've seen," said Alberta energy minister Ken
Hughes, days after he convened a meeting of top pipeline CEOs - including the
heads of Enbridge and TransCanada Corp. - to seek advice and express his
displeasure.

"Everybody needs to step up here," Mr. Hughes said.

"This is a moment of truth for the pipeline industry and for the oil and gas
industry in general. And I have high expectations they're going to deliver on
that."

The pipeline review will see the Energy Resources Conservation Board, Alberta's
oil and gas regulator, call in an independent third party to examine the
province's management of pipeline integrity, spill response and the safety of
pipeline water crossings - many of which were built decades ago using techniques
no longer allowed. Mr. Hughes said that if it appears necessary, he is open to
changing the rules that govern both industry and the regulator itself, although
he did not commit to doing so.

But even those with lengthy industry experience say it is going to be difficult
for either Alberta or the pipeline industry to sway a public that has seen a
litany of spills sully rivers, muskeg, urban areas and farmer's fields across
the continent in the past two years.

"The Alberta government is five years behind announcing a big review of their
pipeline safety," said Richard Ballantyne, the former president of Trans
Mountain Pipe Line and past chair of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.
"I don't think the money is being spent on corrosion and fixing issues with
coatings," he said.

And undoing the recent record of spills will be tough, he said. "They have to
stop having incidents, and that's going to take a number of years."

Environmental groups also criticized a review that will see the resources
conservation board lead an investigation of itself. But those who work to keep
pipelines safe say the provincial regulator is doing a good job - as evidenced
by a spill rate that has substantially declined in past decades - and Enbridge
is making the right moves.

"The thicker wall is probably one of the most effective things that you can do
in terms of increasing the structural integrity of the pipe," said Jake Abes,
the Canadian president for Det Norske Veritas, which does pipeline
risk-management work. More steel helps safeguard a pipe against soil movement,
damage from heavy equipment and corrosion.

Many first nations groups, however, have said they won't be satisfied until
Enbridge can offer a 100-per-cent assurance that there will be no spills in
waters that have important cultural and economic value - an impossible hurdle
for any industrial undertaking. Besides, they say, boosting pipeline standards
does little to fix the likelihood of human error, such as the control room
mistakes that caused a 17-hour delay in identifying the 2010 Enbridge spill in
Michigan, or the risks of oil spilling from tankers navigating West Coast
waters.

"This is a desperate move by a project that's dead," said Art Sterritt,
executive director at Coastal First Nations, an alliance of aboriginal groups
deeply opposed to Gateway. "That's really what it boils down to."

DAM REMOVAL TO REOPEN HABITAT;
 SALMON, SHAD AND ALEWIVES ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SOUADABSCOOK STREAM.

BYLINE: Associated Press

SECTION: LOCAL & STATE, Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 373 words

DATELINE: HAMPDEN


Federal and state officials are poised to oversee the removal of two dams and
the modification of a third, enabling Souadabscook Stream to run wild for the
first time in more than 200 years.

The dams that block the four miles of the stream closest to where it feeds into
the Penobscot River are due to come down by the end of October, reopening 160
square miles of habitat to oceangoing fish, including salmon, shad and alewives.

The project, which could cost as much as $ 100,000 to complete, already has
received a total of $ 40,000 from two corporations, and $ 15,000 from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Natural Resource Conservation Service, the Maine Council of the Atlantic
Salmon Federation and state and federal agencies will oversee the work.

Last November, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the removal of
the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Augusta. That decision was hailed as a
landmark in the fight to tear down crumbling and uneconomical hydropower dams so
that potentially valuable fisheries could be restored.

The relatively tiny Grist Mill Dam at the Route 1A bridge, and the Recreation
Area and Paper Mill dams a few miles farther up the Souadabscook lack the
national renown of the Edwards Dam, which is to be demolished next summer.

But clearing Souadabscook Stream is significant because it will mark the first
in a series of Maine waterways to benefit from the new outlook that favors fish
over electricity from frail and failing dams.

Bob Wengrzynek, state biologist for the Natural Resource Conservation Service,
said the Souadabscook dams are the first of 15 projects in Maine now in the
planning stages, not including the Edwards Dam.

Wengrzynek has the necessary permits to take out the Souadabscook dams beginning
Sept. 15, but he said he will wait until the end of October to see if the Army
Reserves can remove them for free, reducing the costs of the project.

The biologist declined to name all of the other projects being planned because
many are still in the midst of negotiations. But he expects to oversee removal
of the East Machias Dam, the Gardiner Dam on the Cobbosseecontee, and the
Brownville and Columbia Falls dams on the Pleasant River.

IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES? Energy leaders want simpler rules; environmentalists
fear deregulation: ENVIRONMENT

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: SUNDAY INSIGHT; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 883 words


described by environmentalists as the most environmentally sensitive
resource-based industry in North America -- was sliding into a decline. Then a
dramatic shift in its financial situation, and environmental reputation, began
to occur as gas prices began to rebound about two years ago. Previously marginal
development became exceedingly profitable, and it became economically feasible
to drill costly deep wells in Alberta's foothills. The provincial government --
facing the prospect of a big jump in royalties it collects and a big drop in the
piece of political poison known as the deficit -- began selling leases in areas
such as Dinosaur Park, the Whaleback and the Sheep Wildlife Sanctuary. The scene
for conflict with environmentalists was set.

Herald environment writer Vicki Barnett looks at both sides of this growing
debate.

The oil and gas industry will operate practically unregulated, as the federal
government throws regulatory responsibility on to an inadequate Alberta system,
environmentalists say.

The proposed harmonization of provincial and federal laws, policies and programs
could lead to the province deregulating the industry, said Vivian Pharis, a
spokeswoman for the Alberta Wilderness Association.

"It means the Alberta public (would have) almost no control over what industry
does on our public lands," she said.

The federal government, meanwhile, is doing virtually nothing to protect the
environment because it doesn't want to interfere with provincial control over
natural resources, Pharis said.

Federal officials "see provincial jurisdiction as so broad, they won't even
enforce their own legislation, such as the Migratory Birds Act and Fisheries Act
-- the two pieces of wildlife legislation that would be used with some clout to
protect wildlife and wildlife habitat," she said.

Environmental activist Martha Kostuch of Rocky Mountain House said the problem
will become far worse: "The federal government is talking about getting rid of
their laws to a large extent and turning over enforcement of regulations and
legislation to the provinces."

Among a string of other recent events that have appalled Alberta
environmentalists are:

*Nov. 3.-- Brian Bietz, a member of the provincial energy watchdog known as the
Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), said industry is going to have to be
much more responsible for policing itself and meeting regulatory requirements.

Pharis responded that it's ridiculous to believe companies will report
themselves for breaking laws, and pointed out there's no incentive for
self-regulation.

*Nov. 7 -- Ty Lund, Alberta's new environment minister, said he opposes
mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide emissions. Federal Energy Minister Anne
McLellan also indicated recently to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce that she
favors the voluntary method of achieving Canada's international commitment to
freeze carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels.

An angry Rob Macintosh of the Pembina Institute in Drayton Valley described a
voluntary program as a national "inaction" plan.

*Oct. 24 -- The province's auditor general points out taxpayers, not the
industry, are on the hook for millions of dollars to clean up environmental
messes around the province.

*Oct. 21 -- Ty Lund, a self-professed right-wing Tory, received the post of
provincial environment minister.

A few months ago, Lund told the legislature that Special Places 2000 -- a
proposed framework for setting aside protected areas in Alberta -- was the
"sterilization of large tracts of land."

Alberta Wilderness Association president Cliff Wallis said Lund is "a walking
disaster when it comes to environmental matters" and noted he speaks for
industry instead of the environment. Lund couldn't be reached for comment.

* Oct. 7 -- Oil and gas exports are exempted from federal regulations on
environmental assessments.

The announcement was a blow for Mike Sawyer of the Rocky Mountain Ecosystem
Coalition, who appeared at recent hearings of the National Energy Board to fight
for assessment of upstream effects (drilling and production) on Canada's
wilderness.

* September, 1993 -- Environmentalists complain oil and gas wells are exempted
from environmental assessment under the new Alberta Environmental Protection and
Enhancement Act.

That leads to concerns there will be an unfair double standard in Alberta for
different industries, says Wendy Francis, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Parks
and Wilderness Society.

It all amounts to a lack of regulation, Pharis said, aggravated by lack of
enforcement and staff shortages.

"We've only got 10 to 15 fish and wildlife biologists and technicians left in
the field to apply conditions on the 10,000 wells being drilled every year in
the province," she said.

Macintosh estimated that less than five per cent of oil and gas operations in
the field with significant environmental implications are ever inspected.

"In the context of massive deregulation and the effort to save money, we're
seeing the elimination of inspection and enforcement," he said. "And a system
without that inspection and enforcement is not working because there's no
incentive for industry not to take short-cuts that result in contaminated water
and soils, and excessive air pollution."

Alberta cuts energy bureaucracy

BYLINE: Laurie Ward

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 407 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


The Alberta government is overhauling its Ministry of Energy in a move that
includes merging two regulatory boards and axing several agencies.

Energy Minister Pat Black said Friday the changes will cut more than 20% from
the ministry's annual budget of $95 million in the next three years and result
in more efficient service to the energy sector.

''We're declaring a war on inefficiency, duplication and overlap and we intend
to win the war,'' Black told a news conference. She said the number of jobs to
be cut will be announced when the province brings down its budget on Feb. 24.

Two regulatory agencies - the Public Utilities Board and the Energy Resources
Conservation Board - will be merged into a new body called the Alberta Energy
and Utilities Board.

The energy industry had been lobbying hard for a simplified system. The PUB and
the ERCB have annual budgets of $2.9 million and $19.9 million, respectively.

The province plans to do away with the $7-million-a-year Alberta Petroleum
Marketing Commission, which sells crude oil collected as royalties by the
province. After a transition period, the government will let the private sector
market its crude oil, as it now does with natural gas. In 1993, provincial
revenues from royalty crude oil totalled $1 billion.

Ed Chwyl, chief executive officer of Calgary-based Tarragon Oil & Gas Ltd., said
the marketing commission was unnecessary because ''the private sector can do a
better job of selling crude.''

The province is shutting down the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research
Authority, which researches the heavy oil sector with an annual budget of $15.8
million. Gone also will be Alberta Oil Sands Equity, which manages the
province's equity investments in Syncrude Canada Ltd. and the Lloydminister
upgrader and costs $2.6 million annually. Both functions will now be handled by
a new division within the Energy Ministry.

The industry welcomed the changes.

''We see here some potential savings not only to government but to industry in
terms of reduced regulation and red tape,'' said Gerry Protti, president of the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ''We've been asking for this for
many, many years.''

Tarragon Oil's Chwyl applauded the restructuring. ''They have the guts and the
gumption to look at ministry critically - rather than cosmetically - and make
changes that may not be politically correct,'' he said.

Ottawa gets gas ration plan ready

BYLINE: Peter Morton

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 457 words

DATELINE: Ottawa,Ont.


The federal government has prepared a gasoline rationing plan for Canadians,
according to key energy officials.

They said the strategy, which involves the use of gas-rationing coupons, was
activated because of the Persian Gulf crisis but would only be put in place as a
last resort.

Ottawa will launch its drive for conservation through voluntary cutbacks in
energy consumption.

Plans for a national program to conserve energy - which will be publicly
announced shortly - are being unveiled today to the 10 provincial energy
ministers by federal Energy Minister Jake Epp.

The plan calls on Canadians to drive less, use car pools and take public
transit.

Although Canada is nearly self-sufficient in energy, it is part of the 11-member
International Energy Agency. That means if energy production drops 7% - about
3.5 million barrels a day around the world - Canada and other countries such as
the U.S. and the European countries would be obliged to cut back consumption and
share their oil stocks.

Speculation that the Middle East crisis will mean a forced cutback in domestic
energy consumption has been fueled by Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman.

Orman said an unusually cold winter, coupled with increased tensions in the
Middle East, could lead to a worldwide shortfall of 1.5 million barrels of oil a
day.

He said he expects today's talks to cover ''rationing oil if it becomes a
necessity and some consumer awareness issues dealing with reducing
consumption.''

The federal government has been trying to downplay the possibility of rationing
to avoid panic and possibly even hoarding.

Maurice Ruel, head of the Department of Energy's oil and gas division, said it's
unlikely Canadians would have to ration gas unless there was a catastrophic
event such as a refinery explosion.

Ruel said the 4-million-barrel-a-day global shortfall caused by the embargo on
Iraq and Kuwait oil is being made up by other countries.

Non-OPEC countries provide about 29 million of the 50 million barrels burned
each day around the world.

Canadians use about 1.6 million barrels of gasoline and other refined products
each day, although use increases during the winter because of heating
requirements.

Most of that demand is met by Alberta oil, although a lack of pipelines to
Eastern Canada means North Sea and Venezualan oil is imported.

Canada's 27 refineries are already at full capacity and are building up
stockpiles of heating fuels.

Although the issue of gasoline pricing is also high on the agenda, Epp has
already said there is no evidence of gouging by Canadian oil companies. Gasoline
prices are expected to go above 70 cents a litre as a result of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.

What's in a dull name? Often a great return

BYLINE: Patrick Bloomfield

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 15, INSIDE THE MARKETS

LENGTH: 1048 words


''The perfect stock would be attached to the perfect company and the perfect
company has to be engaged in a perfectly simple business, and the perfectly
simple business ought to have a perfectly boring name. The more boring it is the
better.''

So writes Peter Lynch in his best-seller, One Up On Wall Street, which became
available in soft cover last year through Penguin Books..

Lynch is the irreverent professional investor who pushed the Boston-based
Fidelity Magellan Fund along at an average annual compound clip of 34% in the
first 10 years since he took over as investment manager in 1977 - and recently
''retired'' at the grand old age of 46.

When he talks about a ''perfectly boring name,'' he means it. He is thinking of
the kind of name that establishment money managers would not dare to be seen
holding in a portfolio - lest cautious pension plan clients begin to suspect
that there is something dangerously unorthodox about them.

Lynch's best example is Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack.

Yes, that is precisely how this New York Stock Exchange-listed stock appears in
this column's reference book, which also tells us that it is in the business of
distributing auto parts through a U.S.-wide retail chain.

HEAD OFFICE

It was one of his ''tenbaggers'' - stocks that quietly return their discoverers
10 times their original investment until everybody else in the Street wakes up
to what has been going on under their noses.

Lynch liked it all the more after he discovered that its Philadelphia head
office was not in any luxury office tower, but in a neighborhood into which cab
drivers were reluctant to drive.

The nice thing about investing in dull names is that they tend to be pretty
universal.

Independent analyst Gino Blink, who makes his Toronto living from spotting and
nurturing emerging growth stocks, recently reintroduced this column to a dull
name called Canadian Energy Services Ltd.

The first thing that chief financial officer Michael Kaye was at pains to
explain is that the company's business has nothing to do with exploring for,
developing or producing oil, gas or any other form of energy.

But it is very much in the business of helping major users conserve their energy
usage. Though that is a fashionable way of making a living these days, it is
nonetheless a gritty business.

Its president, guiding light and founder is a 48-year-old Vancouver boiler-maker
named Wayne Shaw. He and a group of fellow toilers in the boiler overhaul
business went out on their own in 1975 and have been building a Western Canadian
niche in improving power and heat usage ever since.

TRADITIONAL BUSINESS

Their traditional business is the repair, overhaul, upgranding and installation
of heat and power generating systems. Their main hunting grounds are in the
forest product, petrochemical and electricity utilities industries.

They look to be the kind of people who are as happy to show up in glossy company
photographs in their coveralls as in their business suits.

They have since diversified into the engineering and design of power systems
(through CES Jansen Engineering). They distribute boiler and specialty tubing -
and claim to maintain the largest complete line of such inventory in Western
Canada. They are into asbestos removal (through CES Thermal Services Ltd.).
Through CES Combustion of Vancouver, they have some nifty lines in burners and
burner management systems. And they also have a division supplying refractory
bricks for furnace linings.

More important, they have moved out of small time into major-league work, where
contracts can run into many millions of dollars. Their major competitors today
are the eastern-based subsidiaries of a couple of European multinationals.

Major-league work, of course, has its pluses and its minuses.

The opportunities are bigger. Blink particularly stresses the potential for CES
Combustion's first natural gas pipeline and of new California clear-air
regulations..

The former will open up the Vancouver Island market for new boiler
installations. The Californian environmental thrust could be tailor-made for two
of the burners that CES Combustion markets. Blink says testing by one major oil
refiner appears to have gone well.

On the other hand, larger contracts take longer to complete and can introduce a
certain volatility to quarter earnings numbers, if, as CES does, you only book
your profits as and when the cash actually comes in.

MAIN CONTRACTOR

Thus Blink's estimate of somewhat lower earnings per share for the year just
past ($1.25-$1.30, vs $1.56 in 1989) reflects only one major contract (a
$7-million pollution control job) compared with two in 1989. And most of the
work on that contract will only be done in 1990.

On the other hand, an ill wind from one of those earlier contracts blew some
good for the stock during the yearend festivities.

A dispute between the corporate customer and the main contractor on a job in
which CES was a subcontractor led to the customer holding back $6 million due to
CES.


In terms of a court decision in favor of CES, the main contractor paid CES its
$6 million, provided CES gave it back a letter of credit for the same amount
pending the result of an appeal.

In the final days of 1990 the news came that the appeal had been abandoned,
releasing CES's potential liability. The stock, which has been trading like a
savings bond in a 1990 range of $4.50 to $6, climbed smartly to $6.50. Its
relatively thin market float will probably keep the price tied to earnings
growth.

But, with a compound growth rate of more than 30% in the five years since it
came to the Toronto marketplace, and a price-earnings multiple of little more
than five, this looks remarkably like one of those dull names that would have
had Lynch reach for the writing pad he always kept close at hand.

As Blink stresses, it also has a degree of counter-cyclicality.

The big names in the forest products business tend to put off their major
refurbishings until times are slack.

So CES tends to get the emergency jobs in the good times when the forest
products industry is operating at full steam, and the big jobs in the bad times
when most other contractors are short of work.

Dems walk out of Legislature;
The minority party was miffed that they didn't get one more committee seat.

BYLINE: By PHIL DAVIDSON and COREY TAULE,

SECTION: THE WEST; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 956 words


BOISE - Idaho's House Democrats attempted to flex their newfound political
muscles during Friday's organizational session, walking off the floor in unison
to protest what they perceived as a shortage of seats on the Legislature's
budget-writing committee.

The 19 House Democrats make up roughly 30 percent of the 70-member House.

So they felt they deserved to have three seats on the 10-member Joint
Finance-Appropriations Committee.

The newly elected Republican leadership thought Democrats deserved two.

New House Speaker Lawerence Denney, who adjourned the session without the
Democrats, said the minority party was treated fairly.

Democrats, for instance, went from three to five members on the House Education
Committee.

""I think we'll have good relations,"" Denney said. ""Give it a month to cool
down and things will level out.""

The Democratic protest didn't stop Friday's business from getting done.

Looming largest for eastern Idaho is the elevation of Blackfoot Republican
Dennis Lake to the chairmanship of the House Revenue & Taxation Committee.

The Idaho Constitution mandates that all revenue bills begin in the House. That
gives Lake a large say in what tax bills are debated during the upcoming
legislative session.

""This is one I've always wanted to serve on since I've been in the
Legislature,"" Lake said.

Lake said he plans to work closely with his Senate counterpart, Brent Hill of
Rexburg, who was named Thursday to lead the Senate Local Government & Taxation
Committee.

Also, eastern Idaho House members ended a dry spell on the state's
budget-writing committee when Idaho Falls Republican Janice McGeachin was
selected for a position she's long wanted to fill.

McGeachin gave up a seat on the taxation committee to serve on the committee
that determines budgets for state agencies.

McGeachin said her priority would be to look for ideas proven to work when
allocating money. She expressed support for Rigby Rep. JoAn Wood's proposed
mental-health and drug-rehabilitation center in eastern Idaho.

Wood envisions a center based on Idaho's drug and mental-health courts. She said
she needs $2 million from the budget committee to get started.

""It's a really good idea based on things that have proven successful in the
past,"" McGeachin said.

Also notable is that three eastern Idaho freshmen were assigned to a revamped
House Education Committee - Republicans Dean Mortimer and Jim Marriott and
Democrat Jerry Shively.

Mortimer, an Idaho Falls resident who beat former committee Vice Chairwoman Ann
Rydalch in the GOP primary, essentially replaced her on that committee.

Marriott, of Blackfoot, will serve on the committee, too.

And Democrats surprised nobody when they chose Shively, an Idaho Falls resident
and former Idaho Falls School District 91 trustee, to serve on the education
committee.

A retired music teacher, Shively defeated former House Education Committee
Chairman Jack Barraclough in the November general election.

""A balance,"" Shively said when asked what he hopes to bring to the committee.
""I think that committee has been somewhat extreme.""

Friday was an eye-opening experience for Shively, who participated in a
Democratic walkout he did not anticipate.

Next, House Resources & Conservation Committee Chairman Bert Stevenson of Rupert
welcomed Shively to his committee and told him he had big shoes to fill.

Barraclough, a retired water hydrologist, meant a lot to the committee,
Stevenson said.

""And we'll expect the same from you,"" Stevenson told Shively.

Rexburg Republican Mack Shirley was named vice chairman of the House Education
Committee, somewhat of a surprise since Shirley backed Denney's opponent in the
race for speaker.

Bone Republican Tom Loertscher will serve as vice chairman of the influential
House State Affairs Committee, which would debate hot-button issues such as an
increase in the minimum wage and matters dealing with same-sex marriage.

Also, three Republican veterans kept their chairmanships. Wood will once again
head up the House Transportation Committee. Rep. Lenore Barrett, R-Challis, is
back chairing the Local Government Committee. And Rep. Dell Raybould, R-Rexburg,
will lead the Environment, Energy & Technology Committee.

Incinerated Home Waste Ruled Potential Hazard;
Decision May Result in Higher Landfill Fees

Joan Biskupic, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A7

LENGTH: 709 words


The Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the ash that remains when household waste
is burned can be considered hazardous and ordered dumped in special landfills.
The ruling, which was praised by environmentalists, could significantly increase
the disposal costs for cash-strapped cities.

The 7 to 2 decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, rejects a Clinton
administration position and says that federal law does not exempt
household-waste ash from strict environmental-protection standards. Household
waste before incineration generally is considered nonhazardous.

The quality and designation of ash can mean huge differences in disposal costs,
as much as 10 times more per ton for hazardous materials dumped.

Scalia, narrowly interpreting a federal statute, said the administration's
contrary interpretation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) did
not matter because the law at issue was clear.

"[G]iven the statute's express declaration ... that 'waste that is generated
should be treated, stored, or disposed of so as to minimize the present and
future threat to human health and the environment,' we cannot interpret the
statute to permit ... ash sufficiently toxic to qualify as hazardous to be
disposed of in ordinary landfills," wrote Scalia.

The case involves a Chicago incinerator that processes an estimated 330,000 tons
of household waste a year, reducing the garbage to 110,000 tons of ash and
producing energy for other city needs. It is similar to more than 100 energy
-producing incinerators around the country.

The Environmental Defense Fund sued the city six years ago, alleging that it was
violating RCRA by dumping the ash in landfills not licensed to accept hazardous
wastes. It asserted that tests showed that the ash frequently exceeded federal
hazardous waste standards for lead and cadmium, two heavy metals toxic to humans
at even low levels of exposure. (Among the materials that could cause such
residue are batteries, nails, thermometers, pesticides and cleaning fluids.)

The city had contended that the RCRA statute exempts household waste ash from
strict regulations. It said incineration is a type of "treatment" within the
language of the statute, and that the disposal of ash could be equated with the
disposal of household waste in its earlier forms.

Yet, as Scalia noted in his opinion, ash can be more hazardous than the original
material because in the new medium the contaminants are more concentrated and
readily leachable.

While the lawsuit was in lower courts, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
issued a memorandum saying the ash could be considered nonhazardous waste. But
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit said that was meaningless in the
face of the plain language of 1984 amendment to the 1976 law failing to exempt
the "generation" of ash containing hazardous substances from stringent rules.

In upholding the appeals court, Scalia wrote, "RCRA's twin goals of encouraging
resource recovering and protecting against contamination sometimes conflict. It
is not unusual for legislation to contain diverse purposes that must be
reconciled and the most reliable guide for that task is the enacted text."

Henry Henderson, Chicago's commissioner of environment, said yesterday that the
court ruling will require extensive testing of ash. He estimated that only about
20 percent of the ash from household waste is seriously toxic.

"If we didn't do the testing, we could treat all the ash as hazardous, but then
the entire volume becomes subject to hazardous waste disposal fees," Henderson
said. The difference is $ 38 versus $ 200 per ton in Chicago.

Even dumping a portion of the household ash in special landfills, he asserted,
"will have the effect of rapidly choking off the landfill space for genuinely
hazardous materials."

Karen Florini, a Environmental Defense Fund lawyer, countered yesterday that
cities' complaints about costs are exaggerated. She said that the types of ash
can be separated without major expense, because the more hazardous material
already tends to collect at the top of a stack, in pollution control devices.

Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented in City of Chicago
v. Environmental Defense Fund.

Pipelines overbooked as refiners up demands

BYLINE: KEVIN COX; GAM

LENGTH: 471 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


BY  KEVIN COX
 The Globe and Mail
  CALGARY
  Pipelines are being jammed with record shipments of crude oil from
Alberta.

A major increase in demand from refiners in Central Canada and the
midwestern and eastern United States has resulted in producers asking for
far more space than is available in the major pipelines run by
Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd.

If the situation persists, officials with the Alberta Energy Resources
Conservation Board are warning producers they will have to leave some of
their crude oil in the ground - a situation that hasn't occurred for more
than a year.

Calgary-based Interprovincial, which acknowledges the present oil
supply exceeds its own forecasts, is asking the producers if its pipelines
should be expanded - less than a year after a three-year, $353-million
expansion of the lines was completed.

Industry executives are baffled by the increase in demand, and some
officials in the AERCB suspect the requests for supply may be more than
what the refiners actually want and the producers will supply.

But the AERCB forecast for May states that 208.3 million cubic metres
of Alberta oil is required by refiners and supply is only 185.6 million
cubic metres.

Under the current system, oil refiners make requests for their supply,
and producers offer the oil and ask for pipeline space.

John Newton, economics manager for the AERCB, said some of the refiners
and producers are inflating their estimates to make sure they have space
in the pipeline.

'We think some of the (projected) increase in supply is largely  fictitious," he
said, adding that AERCB officials are asking the industry  to make sure their
requests for pipeline space are realistic.

But for Interprovincial, the pressure on its system by buyers and
sellers of oil is very real. The company may ask producers to cut the
amount of oil they ship through the line by as much as 20 per cent in May,
said Leonard Bradley, director of public affairs for Interprovincial.

'The situation is that despite adding capacity to the lines we still  have more
production than we can handle," he said.

Producers who can't ship on the Interprovincial lines must find a
smaller pipeline to other markets, or keep the oil in storage or in the
ground.

Mr. Bradley said that last year Interprovincial shipped 1.42 million
barrels a day of crude oil through its pipleines, and this year it is
shipping 1.45 million b"d.

He said that all the forecasts Interprovincial had looked at predicted
a decline in production of western Canadian light and medium crude oil.
But those forecasts are being re-examined, especially after federal and
provincial subsidy programs spurred oil drilling.

'Nobody knows what will happen (to future supplies)," he said. 'We  are
consulting the industry about future expansion. We aren't urging  anything on
them; we are presenting options."

   ReSource promotes waste reduction through innovative landfill diversion
programs. ReSource is the waste reduction division of the Center for ReSource
Conservation.  In the spring of 1996 The Boulder Energy Conservation Center
(BECC), now The Center for Resource Conservation, created a program that would
accept and resell various kinds of reusable building materials. Open one day a
week beginning on Earth Day that year, ReSource 2000 made its debut in the
burgeoning sustainability industry. It was originally staffed by highly
motivated board members of the BECC, including Jon Giltner. With a lease of one
dollar a month from Western Disposal, the 1.2 acre sales yard soon took on
energy of its own.  The year 2000 came and went and ReSource found itself still
in existence, subsequently dropping the 2K. A generous 2004 grant from the
Boulder County Resource Conservation Division resulted in the erection of two
steel buildings at the Boulder site, providing equal opportunity for all doors,
windows and cabinets to make it through the winter. Half of one building
provides a processing area where lumber is de-nailed while the other half houses
a wood shop where talented woodworkers create furniture and one of kind pieces
from reclaimed materials.  In 2005 ReSource opened its doors in Fort Collins.
ReSource has been awarded locally and nationally for its waste reduction
efforts. The successful ReSource deconstruction program carefully removes

(LED) lighting products.

Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission to prescribe energy efficiency standards, including standards
applicable to lighting products.

This bill would prohibit the commission from adopting a color rendering index
(CRI) value greater than the CRI value set forth in the United State
Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, as of January 1, 2015, as a
part of energy efficiency standards for lighting products, unless the commission
makes certain findings.

Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local

Premier blasted for appointment

Former ERCB chairman is shocked by Kowalski's posting

The dean of oil regulation in Alberta has condemned the Klein government's
appointment of Ken Kowalski to chair the new Alberta Energy and Utilities Board.

"I think Mr. Klein's decision here is a terrible mistake," said George Govier,
who served on the Energy Resources Conservation Board for 30 years, from 1948 to
1978.

To cut costs, the ERCB and the Public Utilities Board will be merged into the
AEUB, which will regulate both energy development and utility rates.

Govier, 77, is widely seen as the most honored and knowledgeable voice of public
interest on Alberta's oil industry.

The former ERCB chairman of 14 years has never publicly criticized government
energy policy or its operations. He generally supports Klein's initiatives. But
Govier was so shocked last Friday by Klein's naming of a politician to chair the
AEUB that he was compelled to speak publicly.

"I can't believe he thought it through. I don't know whether he had bad advice
or no advice. It's a bad decision."

Politicians have never been named ERCB chairmen. Rather, they've come from
careers in civil service, academia or public regulation. All were educated as
engineers, economists or lawyers.

But Kowalski doesn't hold those credentials and his political history
jeopardizes the regulators' reputation for conservation and maintaining a fair
balance between ambitious oil companies and the public interest, said the former
dean of engineering at the University of Alberta.

"Here is a man to lead the board who has no qualifications to do it. It demands
a thorough understanding of the industry," Govier said.

For Govier to speak out is unprecedented, said David Breen, a University of
British Columbia historian and author of the ERCB's comprehensive history.

"It suggests the depth of feeling and concern," from a public servant who
frequently advised both premiers Ernest Manning and Peter Lougheed, Breen said
Monday.

In the 1950s Govier attracted engineers and geologists to the ERCB staff by
offering salaries that were competitive with industry and encouraging employees
to continually upgrade their skills.

But that professional approach will be jeopardized by selecting a politician as
chief regulator.

"This is not going to be good for morale. I think we are going to see people
leave the organization for that very reason, and that will be a serious loss to
Alberta.

"I can't believe the industry will be pleased with this kind of appointment, but
people in industry probably have to be cautious in what they say. They have to
deal with Mr. Klein, they have to deal with the board," said Govier, whose home
office is decorated with numerous professional and academic accolades.

Allan McLarty, an oil industry lawyer, also expressed concern about Kowalski's
lack of regulation experience.

"If he thinks he's going to catch up in 30 or 60 days, so he can sit on a panel,
or even in a year, that would be ludicrous," said McLarty, who has frequently
argued cases before the ERCB.

Not many rulings from ERCB or the PUB have ended up in court fights, which is a
testament to the regulators' fair treatment, McLarty said.

But that's now at risk if Kowalski doesn't spend the time to equip himself with
the legal tools to run a fair hearing. "These proceedings can be very quickly
scuttled simply by a board chairman making a ruling that's inappropriate or
wrong," he said.

Laurie Smith, another industry lawyer, said Kowalski's appointment probably
won't help the industry's efforts to build environmental credibility in the U.S.
Pacific Northwest, where some of Alberta's conservationists are condemning
industry practices here.

But Smith said Kowalski may be the exact type of administrator the government
wanted -- a strong outside person to merge the two boards.

Dunvegan hydro dam hearing set for Oct. 2

DATELINE: Edmonton

The long wait for approval of the Dunvegan hydroelectric dam on the Peace River
is getting shorter.

A notice of a public hearing scheduled for Oct. 2 in Fairview to hear concerns
about the dam is another step in the sometimes frustrating process that began
more than two years ago to get the project approved.

The meeting is being held jointly by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and
the Natural Resources Conservation Board.

The $175-million, 80-megawatt hydro plant is being proposed by Glacier Power
Ltd., a subsidiary of Calgary-based Canadian Hydro Developers Inc. It would use
40 two-megawatt turbines contained in a six-metre-high weir. The power generated
will be fed into the provincial power grid.

During a pre-hearing meeting in June, a number of parties presented their
positions. John Thompson, application co-ordinator for the NRCB, said the main
concerns identified were the effects on fish movements and populations and ice
buildup on the river and the associated effects of flooding and access
downstream at the town of Peace River.

These concerns will be addressed during the October hearing, along with any new
submissions made before Sept. 14.

Bill Johnson, vice-president of environmental management at Canadian Hydro, said
the process with the province began in April 1999 and the length of time spent
on it is a bit frustrating.

But Thompson said the process is moving forward in a timely fashion. He said the
Dunvegan project is unique and continues to evolve technically, so it's
difficult to compare it with anything else.

Walter Doll, reeve of the Municipal District of Fairview, which Dunvegan falls
within, agreed with Johnson.

He doesn't see any drawbacks to having the hydro project in his backyard.
Instead, Doll foresees increased tax revenue and job opportunities for local
residents.

"It's going to be huge for our municipality," he said.

Jean Charchuk, mayor of the nearby town of Fairview, also feels the project is
taking too long to come to fruition. She thinks it will be good for the region,
with possible tourist activity at the lake that will be created behind the weir.

Scholarship honors civil servant

BYLINE: Darron Kloster, Times Colonist

SECTION: BUSINESS; On the Street; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 1141  words


Donations are pouring into the University of Victoria for a memorial scholarship
to honour one of the province's most respected civil servants.

Jack Ebbels, who died Feb. 25 after suffering a heart attack on a ski slope west
of Calgary, was a lawyer and deputy minister who served the B.C. Public Service
for 25 years, overseeing B.C.'s oil and gas exploration and acting as the
province's chief counsel and negotiator for the historic Nisga'a Treaty. Ebbels,
who was 61, had recently moved to Calgary and sat on the board of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board.

Ebbels was known as a public servant who "got stuff done" and "the best
deal-maker in the province," according to politicians, media and business types.

Former B.C. cabinet minister and deputy premier Dan Miller remembered Ebbels as
"an extremely good deputy minister ... I don't think the vast majority of the
public have an understanding of the civil service, but he exemplified all that
was good about it," Miller told the National Post.

UVic's School of Public Administration hopes Ebbels' memory will inspire the
next generation by offering a yearly scholarship in natural resource management.

The petroleum industry and the Ebbels family have raised close to $125,000 and
another donor will pitch in $5,000 so the first cash award can be given to a
graduate student as early as this September.

"For Jack, government -- regardless of whether it was federal, provincial,
municipal or First Nations -- was all about getting things done for the greater
public good," said Ross Curtis, a former colleague and commissioner for B.C. Oil
and Gas.

"He solved difficult problems and created opportunities by working with people
towards a common goal and we all hope that this scholarship will help develop
more of that talent for Canada."

Donations came gushing in last month from Nexen, Canadian Natural Resources
Ltd., Devon Canada, Shell Canada, Enbridge, Cenovus, Encana, Pembina Pipelines,
Pengrowth, Spectra Canada, Marathon Oil Canada, BP Canada Energy Company, Kinder
Morgan Foundation, Progress Exploration, TransCanada Pipelines, the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers, Energy Resource Conservation Board and
several private donors.

"Many students in our Masters of Public Administration and Masters of Arts in
Dispute Resolution programs obtain co-op placements in the natural resource
management sector and later move into careers in this area," Herman Bakvis,
acting director of UVic's School of Public Administration, said in a release.

"This scholarship will help to draw students to this important sector and Jack's
legacy will live on in the opportunities this scholarship will offer."

department, 250-472-5031 or lmilnes@uvic.ca

Toxic waste spill in northern Alberta biggest of recent disasters on continent

BYLINE: NATHAN VANDERKLIPPE

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; THE ENVIRONMENT; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 754 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


The substance is the inky black colour of oil, and the treetops are brown.
Across a broad expanse of northern Alberta muskeg, the landscape is dead. It has
been poisoned by a huge spill of 9.5 million litres of toxic waste from an oil
and gas operation in northern Alberta, the third major leak in a region whose
residents are now questioning whether enough is being done to maintain aging
energy infrastructure.

The spill was first spotted on June 1. But not until Wednesday did Houston-based
Apache Corp. release estimates of its size, which exceeds all of the major
recent spills in North America. It comes amid heightened sensitivity about
pipeline safety, as the industry faces broad public opposition to plans for a
series of major new oil export pipelines to the U.S., British Columbia and
eastern Canada.

In northern Alberta, not far from the town of Zama City, the leak of so-called
"produced water" has affected some 42 hectares, the size of 52 CFL fields, in an
area less than 100 kilometres south of the Northwest Territories border.

"Every plant and tree died" in the area touched by the spill, said James
Ahnassay, chief of the Dene Tha First Nation, whose members run traplines in an
area that has seen oil and gas development since the 1950s.

Apache spokesman Paul Wyke called the spill "salty water," with "trace amounts"
of oil. The Energy Resources Conservation Board, Alberta's energy regulator,
said it contained roughly 200 parts per million of oil, or about 2,000 litres in
total. But information compiled by the Dene Tha suggests the toxic substance
contains hydrocarbons, high levels of salt, sulphurous compounds, metals and
naturally occurring radioactive materials, along with chemical solvents and
additives used by the oil industry.

Produced-water leaks are considered easier to clean up than oil spills. But the
Dene Tha suspect this is a long-standing spill that may have gone undetected for
months, given the widespread damage it has done. Apache and the Alberta
government say its duration is under investigation.

The leak follows a pair of other major spills in the region, including 800,000
litres of an oil-water mixture from Pace Oil and Gas Ltd., and nearly
3.5-million litres of oil from a pipeline run by Plains Midstream Canada.

After those accidents, the Dene Tha had asked the Energy Resources Conservation
Board, Alberta's energy regulator, to require installation of pressure and
volume monitors, as well as emergency shutoff devices, on aging oil and gas
infrastructure. The Apache spill has renewed calls for change.

"We don't believe that the government is doing enough to ensure upgrades and
maintenance of the lines," Mr. Ahnassay said.

The Apache spill took place in an area rich with wetlands. Though the Dene Tha
suspect waterfowl have died, the company said it has seen no wildlife impacts.
The spill has not reached the Zama River, although the Alberta government said
it has affected tributaries. Water monitoring is ongoing.

Neither Apache nor Alberta initially disclosed the spill, which was only made
public after someone reported it to a TV station late last week. The National
Energy Board, by comparison, sent out a news release Tuesday after a spill of
five to seven barrels of oil at an Imperial Oil Ltd. refinery in Sarnia, Ont.

Bob Curran, a spokesman for the ERCB, defended the late release of information,
saying it took 10 days to determine the size of the spill.

"The second we knew the volumes, we put out a news release," he said. Asked how
it could take so long to determine the severity of a large spill, he said
Wednesday: "We didn't know it was over 42 hectares. We found that out last
night."

Environmental groups have long criticized the government for being slow to
notify the public when things go wrong with the oil industry, the province's
financial lifeblood. "This latest spill should call into question the provincial
government's decision to hide the pipeline safety report they received last year
and the failure to follow through on the public pipeline safety review the
Minister of Energy promised last July," said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema
in a statement.

A spokesman for Energy Minister Ken Hughes said the province trusts its energy
regulator to decide when to release information based "on a process of
established science and protocol."

Apache said in a statement that it has halted the leak and "taken steps to
contain the release as the company continues to map, sample and monitor the
impacted areas."

Alberta aims to get public onside in fracking debate; Province will stress
education, transparency, official says

BYLINE: Trish Audette, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 540  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


The provincial government plans to ensure Albertans have credible, trustworthy
information about hydraulic fracturing as the controversial method - popularly
known as "fracking" - is used more often to pull energy resources from the
ground, a top bureaucrat said Monday.

"Public education, community engagement, even media engagement are themes that
seem to be growing around this to make sure that we're not maybe repeating the
same thing we saw in the oilsands, where everybody seemed to have their own sets
of facts - causing confusion ultimately to the general public," said Andy Ridge,
the water policy director for Alberta Environment and Water. "So how do we get
ahead of that on hydraulic fracturing?"

Last month, the Energy Resources Conservation Board - a regulatory body acting
at arm's length from the government - announced it would make public information
about what chemicals are used when companies push water, sand and other products
through wells to fracture the earth and draw up gas or oil. A website is
expected to be available to Albertans by the end of the year, putting the
province in line with work done in British Columbia.

But on Monday, Ridge said transparency on hydraulic fracturing - from fracture
fluids that can be unrecyclable and unreusable, to water testing and monitoring
water use - demands Alberta Environment work in partnership with the independent
board.

The practice of reaching horizontally for hard-to-get oil and gas lying hundreds
of metres underground has drawn opposition from those who worry about water
contamination and other environmental damage. Particularly popular in the
northeast United States and northeastern British Columbia, the practice has been
banned in Quebec. In Alberta, a fracking blowout near Innisfail in January has
raised local awareness about the process.

Last week, industry members and public relations experts met in Calgary to
discuss "increasing public acceptance and community support for unconventional
oil and gas developments" at a conference featuring oil and gas executives and
Ridge as a provincial government representative.

Ridge's presentation was touted as an explanation of "how the government will
support the Canadian oilsands, tight oil and shale gas industries to generate
federal support for production." But in presentation slides provided to The
Journal on Monday, Ridge outlined the roles and responsibilities of government,
how fracturing fits into Alberta's energy regulations already, and what is
coming up next under the "guiding principles" of transparency, credibility and
relevance.

Ridge said open-source data, like the province has begun to roll out for the
oilsands, are necessary as more multistage hydraulic fracturing well sites are
established. Alberta Environment counts 170,000 multistage hydraulic fracturing
sites, and the resources conservation board says the practice takes place all
over the province since it became commercially viable about four years ago.

So far, Ridge said, there has been "a lot of leadership out of the U.S. on
promoting (public data-sharing). I think (in) Canada we've been a bit slow, in
part because we have a good relationship with our industry, and our resource
communities."

Hearing set for dam on Peace River: $175M, 80-megawatt hydro plant proposed by
Glacier Power

DATELINE: Calgary

The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and Natural Resources Conservation Board
have set Oct. 2 for a public hearing at Fairview into building a small
hydro-electric dam on the Peace River.

The $175-million, 80-megawatt hydro plant is being proposed by Glacier Power
Ltd., a subsidiary of Calgary-based Canadian Hydro Developers.

A joint pre-hearing report by the two boards said several issues need to be
addressed at the hearing. Among them:

- flow of the Peace River, including potential for slumping and erosion, and
impacts on other river users;

- the river's ice regime and associated impacts of flooding and ferry and bridge
access;

- fish movements and populations;

- wildlife populations and habitats.

Glacier has proposed to build a facility utilizing 40 two-megawatt turbines
contained within a six-metre high weir to be built about three kilometres north
of the Highway 2 Dunvegan Bridge crossing.

The project would produce sufficient power for 40,000 homes.

The company has already prepared an environmental-impact assessment report, but
environmentalists have complained about potential wildlife threats and damage
posed by the project.

The complete pre-hearing report is available on the EUB Web site at:
www.eub.gov.ab.ca and on the NRCB Web site at www.gov.ab.ca/nrcb/.

Fairview is about 600 km northwest of Edmonton.

Sun, wind bringing power to area farms: Farmers share experiences in setting up
alternative energy systems.

BYLINE: Chris Woodka, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 596 words


Feb. 5--ROCKY FORD -- Because farms are in remote locations, they are an ideal
vanguard for the green revolution of alternative energy.

But location also makes it difficult to hook up to transmission lines that carry
electricity to larger cities.

Wind, solar and biodiesel strategies by farmers and ranchers who are already
dabbling in new energy sources were shared with a crowd of more than 100 at the
sixth annual Arkansas Valley Farm, Ranch, Water Symposium and Trade Show
Thursday.

The event is sponsored by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Lower
Arkansas Valley Water Conservancy District, Farm Service Agency, Colorado State
University Extension, the city of Rocky Ford and numerous local businesses. It
focuses on issues of concern to the agricultural economy.

"In 2004, we looked at the potential for a commercial wind farm in Baca County,
but there was a problem with the transmission of power," said Fred Hefley, a
Walsh-area farmer and rancher who was part of a group of 30 people investigating
the possibility.     Still, that effort led to the realization that Baca County
is one of the windiest areas in the state and ripe for developing wind power.

Hefley continued to work on obtaining  a   grant   for   on-farm wind power with
the help of the Southeast Colorado Resource Conservation and Development agency.

In 2007, the grant helped fund two 50-kilowatt wind turbines on Hefley's H20
Farm, which will use much of the power to drive pivot irrigation systems. Some
of the power is sold back to the Southeast Colorado Power Association, through
net metering, which credits the farm for supplying power when it is not using
it.

Since completing the turbines in August, they have ramped up to about 20 percent
of capacity, a reflection of how well they harness wind power.

"Our goal is 25 percent," Hefley said.

It cost $175,000 to install the wind turbine, and it would take about nine years
to recover the cost in savings on electricity, he added.

Incentives and tax credits paid for more than two-fifths of the costs, Hefley
added.

In the Boone-Fowler area, the sun shines more often than the wind blows, said
farmer and rancher Doug Tecklenburg, a lifelong resident of the area.

"I'm not here to knock windmills," Tecklenburg said. "We've had them since I was
a kid."

Tecklenburg began installing solar panels at stock well locations on his ranch
in 2003. Soon, he was putting them in for his neighbors as well.

As technology has improved, the panels have gotten smaller. They were typically
4 by 9 feet when he started, and now the same power can be generated by panels
less than half that size. Some are set up near windmills that are falling into
disrepair.

"We found there's a lot less maintenance and a lot more days with sun than
wind," Tecklenburg said.

Solar-powered pumps are good for remote locations and more portable than wind,
he added.

One array can serve multiple locations as well.

Any drawbacks?

"It takes a while for the water to come, and you sit there and say, 'Good night,

Is the grass greener in Ellenboro Township?

LANCASTER, Wis. - Rocky Skemp wishes he had a sign posted by a sloping field
along Lincoln Road east of Lancaster in Ellenboro Township.

"A person drives by, and thinks it's a weed patch," said Skemp, of Platteville,
who manages Scott Farm Enterprises. "This isn't just a weed patch, its got grass
underneath it."

Switchgrass, that is.

Skemp is one of several Grant County agribusinessmen involved in a switchgrass
research project.

Southwest Wisconsin might soon become a hotbed for biomass utilization as local
power plants have made commitments to produce energy using biomass in the near
future. Alliant Energy is proposing the development of a power plant in
Cassville that the utility claims could use more than 300,000 tons of biomass -
including switchgrass - on an annual basis.

Skemp has been involved since Alliant announced its plans to use biomass . He is
working with Steve Bertjens, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS)
Coordinator for Southwest Badger Resource Conservation & Development.

"The plus for me is, that we have 880 acres here and some of it is not real
good, fertile ground, so it fits the need for some other type of crop, other
than soybeans and corn, and that's what were looking to do a little of," Skemp
said.

There are concerns, too.

"The biggest concern is getting a fair price for the product to compensate us,
the same as corn or beans would do," Skemp said. "As a businessman, I can't put
a bunch of acres into switchgrass just because we want to. We want to be able to
make some money doing it. When we find out what it is worth, then we'll make the
next step and see how many acres we want to put in."

He said the key is research.

"I have to know what the futures are, like corn and beans," he said.

The test plots contain a variety of herbicide and fertilization trials that will
help determine how to maximize yields and profitability. Little is known about
the yields that can be expected in southwest Wisconsin.

"I'd say that right now we don't have the markets available, so I'm not really
encouraging people to make an economic investment in planting it," Bertjens
said. "But things are changing fast, and I think that within a couple of years
we are going to be looking at having some established markets in southwest
Wisconsin."

Skemp is encouraged.

Bertjens notes landowners won't be the only beneficiaries of biomass.

"Alliant Energy has said if they are able to use biomass in their plants they're
not going to be the ones who are doing the processing," he said. "Farmers will
plant the crops, you'll have loggers out harvesting wood, you'll have
contractors harvesting switchgrass, someone processing that, and someone
trucking it to the plant. We're talking lots of jobs, and that's sustainable
agriculture and sustainable communities."

Deal seen as lever for conservation

BYLINE: John Fox

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 392 words


The Ontario government should force Consumers' Gas Co. Ltd. to encourage energy
conservation before approving the $1.1-billion sale of the utility to British
Gas PLC, an energy watch-dog says.

Norman Rubin, executive director of Toronto-based Energy Probe, says the
$34-a-share bid made by British Gas in March for Canada's largest natural gas
distributor offers no net benefit to Canada as required under the Investment
Canada Act.

But if the Ontario Energy Board, which sets rates for the province's three gas
utilities, forced Consumers' new owners to promote energy conservation by
changing provincial regulations, the sale would pay off in lower gas bills and a
cleaner environment.

While natural gas burns more cleanly than oil or coal, Rubin said it still
produces carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. Rubin said the
proposal would not hurt Consumers' profitability.

A spokesman for the provincial Energy minstry would not comment on Energy
Probe's proposal but said similar proposals the group made for Union Gas Ltd.
are being addressed in an OEB report to be published in the next few weeks.

The British Gas bid for Consumers' - which is 82.5% owned by GW Utilities Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Reichmann-owned Olympia & York Developments Ltd. - needs the
approval of the Ontario cabinet, which is awaiting the results of an OEB hearing
into the deal. The hearing should begin in late June.

Rubin said current gas rate regulations were devised before there was much
concern about global warming and they encourage utilities to sell as much gas as
possible.

Utilities should be encouraged to sell or lease energy-saving equipment, like
high-efficiency furnaces and appliances, and storm windows and doors, Rubin
said.

The initial capital costs of purchasing equipment would be high, he said, so the
OEB should guarantee utilities a profit in the early years of their conversion
to conservation.

The group also wants Consumers to maintain an arm's-length relationship with Bow
Valley Industries Ltd., of Calgary if the deal is approved. British Gas owns 51%
of Bow Valley, a major natural gas producer.

Rubin said it might be too tempting for British Gas to require Consumers to buy
gas from Bow Valley at above market prices if Consumers could pass on the extra
costs to its customers.

Town residents still leery about sulphur plans; Possible health, fire fears
voiced

BYLINE: Hanneke Brooymans, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITYPLUS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 638  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


For almost seven years, Hazco Environmental Services has wanted to set up a
sulphur-handling facility north of Edmonton but no version of its project has
yet been welcomed by neighbours.

Back in 2002, the plan was to dig a big pit near Gibbons and bury the unwanted
sulphur, a waste product from the oil and gas industry. That was rejected by
Sturgeon County council.

Now the plan is to transform molten sulphur into solid, two-to-four millimetre
pellets at a site near Bruderheim before shipping it off for sale overseas.

Hazco project manager Robert Mann says they are different projects involving
different customers.

But the thought of that much sulphur in their communities continues to make
people living close to the site nervous.

For Denis Van Brabant, whose house is one kilometre from the proposed facility,
the No. 1 concern is the potential health impacts of a possible sulphur fire.

Van Brabant and his wife live on their three-hectare plot with their four boys,
aged four to 10. He fears that firefighters trained to deal with a sulphur fire
might not be close enough.

"I'd like to know, if there is a real emergency, how they'll respond to it."

Sulphur dust is readily ignited by flame, static electricity or friction spark,
says an industry standard material safety data sheet. "Every reasonable step
must be taken to minimize dust formation," the publication says. Burning sulphur
creates sulphur dioxide.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board is still investigating a sulphur fire
that ignited last August on a block of sulphur near an Apache Canada gas plant
in northwestern Alberta. Three workers at the site were taken to the hospital in
High Level with non-life-threatening injuries, the board said at the time.

Apache evacuated approximately 15 workers from the site. Several workers were
also evacuated from nearby sites as a precaution, and 30 families voluntarily
evacuated from Zama City.

Van Brabant is one of the Friends of Lamont County intervening before the
Natural Resources Conservation Board. The board will meet today in Lamont to
discuss which issues will be examined at the hearing.

Others set to submit letters of concern

include Lamont County, the Lamont Health Care Centre and the Town of Bruderheim.

Alberta Sulphur Terminals Ltd., a subsidiary of Hazco, would build its facility
2.2 kilometres east of Bruderheim and four kilometres from Lamont.

Bruderheim deputy mayor Shelley Ross said the town is concerned about the
long-term health risks associated with a possible explosion. "Further, we are
concerned about any long-term health risks that our residents may be exposed to
due to improper storage and handling of sulphur and its byproducts," says a
letter she signed to the Natural Resources Conservation Board.

Mann said the company's first phase would handle almost 1.1 million tonnes
annually. The full licence application is for twice that capacity.

Alberta produced 5.64 million tonnes of sulphur in 2008, according to the Energy
Resources Conservation Board. By 2015, sulphur production is expected to reach
7.8 million tonnes, with upgrader sulphur production tripling.

Mann said Hazco thinks the project is safe.

"Hazco has done extensive public consultation to try to alleviate or answer the
questions that have been raised," he said. "We even formed a public consultation
committee that opposition groups, and industry and municipalities and county
representatives sit on to go through the project."

If the Natural Resources Conservation Board approves the project, the company
will still need to get an operating permit from Alberta Environment. Then it
would return to its case before the subdivision and development appeal board,
where the company was appealing a decision by Lamont County's planning
commission to reject the proposed project location.

Q:  How are local schools involved in conserving energy?

A:  Boulder Valley and St. Vrain School Districts participate in the ReNew Our
Schools program in which middle and high schools compete in an energy reduction
challenge to lower schools' operating costs along with their environmental
impact. The schools that reduce their energy usage by the greatest percentage
win up to $25,000 worth of renewable energy technology for the school.





 ROS allows students to learn why conserving energy is important and encourages
them to apply their knowledge first-hand. Summit Middle School, one of the
winning schools from last school year's competition, received solar panels for
their efforts along with something more.



 "The contest inspired me and my peers to make a difference," says Summit
student Elle Meyer. "It really taught us that even though we may be a small
group of people we can make a huge difference environmentally. It also changed
my perspective entirely on the kind of positive impact that I can have."



 The competition will run from November through early January 2012. The
selection process for the contest will begin in September.



 The competition is expanding to other schools and school districts in Colorado.

Lawsuit on drilling waste draws concerns from industry, regulators

BYLINE: By Paul Monies Business Writer pmonies@oklahoman.com

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 1046 words


A decades-old exemption for drilling waste from a federal law is being
challenged by environmental groups, with the issue drawing concerns from the
energy industry and state regulators.A coalition of seven environmental groups
sued the Environmental Protection Agency in May, claiming the agency failed to
issue nonhazardous drilling waste regulations and then didn't revise them
regularly.The case is still in the early stages, but some regulators and
industry representatives worry about a ruling against the EPA or the possibility
of new regulations.Attorneys and staff at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission
heard an update Tuesday on the federal case by a group of attorneys from the
Crowe &amp; Dunlevy law firm. The presentation was part of "desk week" at the
agency. That's when the commission's court system and related departments work
on planning and other matters such as required continuing legal education.After
a review, EPA decided in 1988 that classifying drilling wastes as hazardous
under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was unwarranted because
existing state and federal programs were adequate.Hazardous solid waste
enforcement under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is
delegated to the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality. Solid waste
related to oil and gas operations is delegated to the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission.In Oklahoma, the produced water&nbsp;- and the suspended
solids&nbsp;- that comes up with oil and natural gas is classified as a
"deleterious" substance, not hazardous.

Most of it is put in disposal wells, although a large increase in volumes of
such disposal into the deep Arbuckle formation has been linked to man-made
earthquakes in Oklahoma.New techniquesIn their lawsuit, the environmental groups
said the increase in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in
unconventional formations requires new regulations for drilling waste."As a
consequence of this rapid growth, the industry now generates vast amounts and
wide varieties of liquid and solid wastes during exploration and production,
including wastewater, drill cuttings, residual waste and drilling muds," the
complaint said. "All of these wastes can contain harmful constituents ranging
from heavy metals to hydrocarbons to naturally occurring radioactive
materials."The groups want the court to rule EPA is in violation of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. They want a new determination that drilling waste
should be considered a hazardous substance. The groups also want EPA to review
and revise existing state plans.Crowe &amp; Dunlevy Director Mary Ellen Ternes
said federal law isn't very clear on the differences between hazardous and
nonhazardous waste. Much of it depends on the context of the uses or the
industry, she said.For example, some municipal solid waste could be hazardous,
but it's not regulated as such because landfill regulations are already designed
to protect the public.&nbsp;"This area is confusing. It's not completely laid
out in the statutes or rules in a very straightforward manner," Ternes said of
the drilling waste lawsuit. "If we were to take this to court, we have many
arguments for why we should continue to do what we're doing without revision. We
manage the material in a protective manner, and EPA has been quite
active."Industry groups interveneNorth Dakota and three industry groups, the
American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of
America, Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, filed to
intervene in the case. They said the EPA is already taking the right path by
delegating the regulation to the states.A filing by North Dakota said
reclassifying its permits for drilling waste could cost the state $87 million
and its operators $58 million. North Dakota regulators said the claim that
drilling wastes and wastewater wasn't properly regulated is false.&nbsp;"Instead
it is subject to stringent regulation by people who are familiar with local
conditions&nbsp;- with substantial input from members of the public who live in
the area and are directly affected," said the affidavit by Lynn Helms, director
of the North Dakota Industrial Commission's mineral resources
department.&nbsp;For its part, EPA didn't provide much insight into its thinking
when it filed a response to the complaint last week. The agency said it last
studied the drilling waste issue in a 2015 technical document. The response said
the specific allegations weren't outlined in the environmental groups' notice to
sue. EPA's attorneys also said the statute of limitations on challenging the law
had expired."Sue-and-settle"?In Tuesday's briefing, Corporation Commissioner
Todd Hiett asked the Crowe &amp; Dunlevy attorneys if the lawsuit could be a
case of "sue-and-settle," a purported regulatory strategy where an agency
"invites" lawsuits by parties friendly to the federal administration."The tepid
response by the EPA has led me to think this is reminiscent of the
'sue-and-settle' cases under the Clean Air Act," said Hiett, a Republican.Erin
Potter Sullenger, a Crowe &amp; Dunlevy associate, said that tone was evident in
the industry groups' response to the lawsuit."If the court says (EPA) has a
nondiscretionary duty, they want to make sure they're at the table to talk about
when these deadlines will be set and what EPA is actually being required to
review," she said. "The 'sue-and-settle' language is not there, but I think with
the tone of industry's petition, it would seem that's on their mind at
least."The lawsuit on drilling waste is similar to an earlier lawsuit brought by
environmental groups under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regarding
coal ash disposal. That lawsuit came after an accidental release of coal ash
from containment ponds in Tennessee in 2008. As a result, EPA created minimum
standards for solid-waste management plans for coal ash.The drilling waste
lawsuit was filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia. The
environmental groups suing are the Environmental Integrity Project; the Natural
Resources Defense Council; Earthworks; the Center for Health, Environment and
Justice; West Virginia Citizen Action Group; Responsible Drilling Alliance; and
San Juan Citizens Alliance.

Bio-waste facility okay with EDC

BYLINE: Rick Longley, Orland Press Register, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 574 words


Jul. 11--The Orland Economic Development Commission is okay with a proposed bio-
energy and waste management facility east of Orland.

It listened to a presentation by Orland City Councilman Mike Yalow on Monday
about the project to be located off Highway 32 six miles from town.

Yalow asked the body for a letter of support on the facility, but members did
not think they needed to provide one because the city council already had
provided one, he said.

The EDC, however, did indicate it would support the facility to be built by Kara
Baker and her family at a gravel plant owned by the Bakers, Yalow said.

This facility, if approved, would dispose of municipal waste and other waste
products and convert it to energy such as electricity or natural gas, he said.

It has received endorsements not only from Orland city officials, but the Glenn
County Board of Supervisors and the Central Sacramento Valley Natural Resource
Conservation and Development group, of which, Yalow also is a member.

The RC&D wants to play a role in the project, he said, and is starting the
strategic planning with Baker to move it forward.

Permits are needed, public hearings will have to be held and a host of work will
need to be done before it can be built and put into operation, Yalow said.

Right now, the RC&D is looking into the feasibility of the plant and what
existing technology is available to run it along with its fit for the area, he
added.

Supporters also are looking at the "feed stock" or bio mass materials that would
be converted to energy.

A study was performed on area waste in 2001-2002, Yalow said, but it is
outdated.

So a current study is needed to examine each type of waste product to be
processed.

There is municipal waste, orchard waste, cattle waste, household waste,
commercial waste and more, and they will need to address each type for quantity
and technology needed to process it.

Dairy waste is different from the types of waste considered for processing here,
Yalow said, so he doubts much of it would be used.

The role of material recovery also is to be considered, he said, where clean
waste is separated from dirty waste or non-recyclable materials. Impacts on the
environment and landfills will need to be reviewed, too.

Transportation is another big issue along with public acceptance, Yalow said.

"We want people to realize we are not burning trash, but converting it to
energy," he said, with the help of engineering and technology.

The work has started in the last three weeks, Yalow said, with input from Larry
Akins, coordinator with the RC&D, that takes in Glenn, Butte, Colusa and Tehama
counties.

"All the time RC&D council members spend with clients is donated time," he said.
"We are trying to develop jobs along with helping the environment."

However, the Glenn County Resource Conservation District is different from the
RC&D in Orland since the county agency works on wildlife habitat, watershed and
ag restoration issues in Glenn County. However, both agencies work together when
needed, he said.

Costs for oil companies pile up after spill;
Many producers hit as closing of Rainbow line results in well shutdowns, added
expense of trucking

BYLINE: NATHAN VANDERKLIPPE

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; OIL AND GAS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 1055 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Oil companies are shutting down wells and facing major increases in
transportation costs as they load crude on trucks to work around a major spill
that has stirred health concerns in a small Alberta community and closed the
northern stretches of an important pipeline.

The province's energy regulator is warning that it will not authorize a restart
of the Rainbow pipeline, which sprang another substantial leak five years ago,
until it is satisfied the line is not plagued with systemic problems.

The 220,000 barrel-a-day Rainbow line is owned by a Canadian subsidiary of
Houston-based Plains All American Pipeline L.P. Last Friday, it developed a leak
that spilled 28,000 barrels into the forest and muskeg of northern Alberta. It's
the biggest spill in the province since 1975, and substantially larger than the
Enbridge Inc. leak in Michigan last summer that has cost that company
$550-million (U.S.).

Apart from operational impacts, the spill has stirred new questions about the
safety of North America's aging pipeline network, which has experienced a series
of high-profile spills in the last year. Recent weeks have seen a small leak on
the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain line and a separate Alberta gas line leak that
killed a maintenance worker.

Crews have been working around the clock to clean up the Rainbow spill, which
the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board said is contained. The line runs
770 kilometres, from Zama, Alta., to Edmonton.

But leaders of the 300-member Cree community of Little Buffalo, about 30 km from
the spill, say people have fallen ill from the smell and fumes of crude, and
that some leaked material is being held back by a beaver dam, which has given
rise to worry about the potential for greater environmental damage.

The ERCB said it will take a cautious approach to authorizing the pipeline's
reopening. "Our staff have to determine if it's a one-time thing that happened
there or if it's evidence of a systemic problem with the line," spokesman Davis
Sheremata said. "Until they're convinced that it's not, they are not going to
give the okay to restart operations."

That has created uncertainty and hurt output among companies that rely on the
line, because they have almost no pipe alternatives to transport crude out of a
series of important light-oil plays in northern Alberta and the Northwest
Territories.

The number of affected companies is long, and includes Imperial Oil Ltd., Husky
Energy Inc., Penn West, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Baytex Energy and Pinecrest
Energy. However, some of them ship only small amounts on Rainbow. Forest Oil
Corp. and Harvest Operations Corp. are also believed to use the line.

On Wednesday, Husky said that it has "reduced upstream production from the
region along this pipeline." Husky, like other companies scrambling for
workarounds, is now trucking crude to different pipelines. Such a strategy is
not cheap. Where it might cost $1 (Canadian) or $2 a barrel to ship on Rainbow,
a trucked barrel runs $7 to $9.

"Having said that, oil is north of $100 (U.S.). So realistically, although it
sounds like a lot in comparison to what your normal transportation charges are,
you're stupid not to truck it," said Jason Fleury, senior manager of investor
relations with Penn West. "Because corporately, typically that result on the
quarter is a few pennies per barrel of oil equivalent."

Trucking, however, creates problems beyond cost. When storage fill up, companies
must shut down wells until the next truck comes by to empty the tanks.

"We've had some wells shut in for parts of the day," said Wade Becker, the chief
executive officer of Pinecrest, which relies on Rainbow for all but 300 of its
2,400 barrels of daily production. But, he said, "it's not prolonged."

The greater concern for companies is what this spill will do to an industry
already struggling with public opinion, which is increasingly turning against
pipelines. Two major new projects - TransCanada's Keystone XL and Enbridge's
Northern Gateway   have been subjected to intense criticism, and leaks have made
it difficult for opponents to believe company assurances that they will be built
safely. That, in turn, has created uncertainty about whether the projects will
receive government approval.

The leak from Rainbow, which was built in 1966, has renewed questions about the
safety of North America's aging pipeline network. In Alberta, 40 per cent of
pipe was built before 1990. In the U.S., 41 per cent of crude pipe was built in
the 1950s and 1960s; another 15 per cent before then.

Rainbow has experienced problems commonly associated with age. A 2006 leak of
7,500 barrels was blamed on stress corrosion cracking, fatigue cracking and
external coating failure.

Industry representatives, however, say it's wrong to blame age for problems.
"With in-line inspection and appropriate maintenance, there's nothing that
suggests that it automatically is a factor," said Brenda Kenny, president of the
Canadian Energy Pipelines Association.

The ERCB also cautioned against pointing to age. The Rainbow pipe break "looks
like a small crack running around at least half of the pipeline," Mr. Sheremata
said. Three causes are likely: The company could have been running it with too
much pressure; there may have been a problem with the protective coating that
led to corrosion; or the land might have shifted.

"The land could heave or move in a way that could rupture the pipeline," he

Statement of Basis/ Proposed Plan

for the M Area Operable Unit

The United States Department of Energy (USDOE) will release a Statement of
Basis/Proposed Plan on May 13, 2008 describing the proposed remedial actions for
the M Area Operable Unit (MAOU) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The South
Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) will also
release a draft Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permit
modification for the proposed remedial action for this unit. These documents
will be available for public review and copying at the locations listed below.
The public comment period is scheduled for May 13, 2008 to June 26, 2008.

The Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan was completed to meet the terms of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), a
law governing the investigation and cleanup of waste units. USDOE has worked
with the United States Environmental Protection Agency- Region 4 (USEPA) and the
SCDHEC to ensure the remedial approach is consistent with all applicable
environmental requirements.

The USDOE, USEPA and SCDHEC have reviewed the risks associated with the operable
unit and have evaluated cleanup alternatives. The final actions proposed are
thought to be necessary after the completion of removal actions for
radiological, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and metals contamination in the
soils and concrete at the MAOU. Public comment periods were previously provided
for the removal actions via the Removal Site Evaluation Report/Engineering
Evaluation/Cost Analysis at the Production Area of M Area Operable Unit
(WSRC-RP-2006-4059, Revision 1, December 2006) and the Removal Site Evaluation
Report/Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis for the Contaminated Surficial Soil
in the 741-A Salvage Yard at the M Area Operable Unit (WSRC-RP-2006-4053,
Revision 1, February 2007) The following final actions are recommended for the
MAOU:

1.Building Slab 313-M: Passive soil vapor extraction (SVE) will be implemented
in areas where VOCs [e.g., trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene
(PCE)] are present in the vadose zone at concentrations that may impact
groundwater above maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) Institutional Controls,
including grouting of the MIPSL manholes to prevent access, will also be
implemented.

2.Building Slabs 320-M and 321-M: Passive SVE will be implemented in areas where
VOCs [e.g., TCE and PCE] are present in the vadose zone at concentrations that
may impact groundwater above MCLs and with the stockpiled soils (< 50 mg/kg)
from the early action. The stockpiled soils will be consolidated and placed so
that no further handling of the materials is needed after treatment. The SVE
system at the early action location may include an infiltration/vapor barrier to
enhance barometric pumping and to impede groundwater migration. Institutional
Controls, including grouting of the MIPSL manholes to prevent access, will also
be implemented.

3.Building Slabs 322-M, 324-M, 340-M, 341-M, 341-1M and 341-8M, Salvage Yard
Area (741-A, 740-A, 743-A), Test Reactor Facilities (305-A and 777-10A),
Warehouses (330-M and 331-M), Miscellaneous Buildings, and Electrical
Transformers: Institutional Controls will be implemented.

These alternatives will be protective of human health and the environment. They
are also intended to be the final actions for the MAOU.

The MAOU is located in the northwest portion of the Savannah River Site. Special
nuclear materials for the Department of Defense were produced in this area
between 1952 and 1988. An important step in the production cycle was the
manufacture of fuel and target assemblies in M Area for nuclear reactors. M Area
consisted of three major production buildings (313-M, 320-M, and 321-M) that
began operation in the early 1950s and continued operation at various production
levels until the early 1990s. In addition to the production facilities, two
support laboratories (320-M and 322-M) and three support facilities (322-M,
324-M, and 340-M) were also located in this area. Two test reactor facilities
were located to the south (305-A and 777-10A).

The MAOU is divided into several areas based on physical location and common
problems warranting action:

"Production Area: 313-M, 320-M, 321-M (including Underground Sumps #001 and
#002), 322-M, 324-M (including the northern portions of the MIPSL and associated
feeder lines), and 340-M

"Salvage Area: 740-A, 741-A, and 743-A

"Liquid Effluent Treatment Facilities: 341-M, 341-1M, and 341-8M

"Test Reactor Facilities: 305-A and 777-10A

"Warehouses: 330-M and 331-M

"Miscellaneous Buildings

"Electrical Transformers

Comments on the Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan and the draft RCRA permit are
requested by June 26, 2008. Upon completion of the public comment period, a
Responsiveness Summary that addresses public comments will be prepared. The
Responsiveness Summary will be made available with the Record of Decision and
the final RCRA permit modification and will be sent to each person who submits
comments.

Copies of the Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan are available in the
administrative record, which also contains the RCRA Facility
Investigation/Remedial Investigation (RFI/RI) Report with Baseline Risk
Assessment for this unit. The administrative record is available in the
information repositories listed below:

Shell oilpatch permits assailed; US$13.7B expansion; Greenhouse vow broken,
green groups allege

BYLINE: Scott Haggett, Reuters

SECTION: FINANCIAL POST; Pg. FP3

LENGTH: 434  words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Canadian environmental groups asked regulators yesterday to rescind approvals
for part of a US$13.7-billion expansion of Royal Dutch Shell PLC's oil sands
project, alleging the company backed off promises to cut greenhouse-gas
emissions.

The Oil Sands Environmental Coalition -- which includes the Pembina Institute,
the Toxics Watch Society of Alberta and the Fort McMurray Environmental
Association -- say Shell has broken a negotiated agreement to significantly cut
the output of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide from an expansion of
its Muskeg River and Jackpine oil sands mines in northern Alberta.

The coalition is asking the Canadian government and Alberta's Energy Resources
Conservation Board, who jointly approved the project, to reconsider their ruling
through a new public hearing because Shell's promise was a factor in the
decision.

"Shell has broken a binding agreement," said Simon Dyer, oil sands program
director at the Pembina Institute. Regulators "can reopen those approvals given
that Shell has clearly reneged on its commitment."

The groups claim Shell agreed to come up with specific targets for cuts to
greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions at the mine sites.

Instead, they say the company told them it will not quantify its GHG cuts,
deciding instead to wait for the federal government to come up with regulations
on emissions.

Canada's oil sands have the largest reserves outside the Middle East. However
separating the tar-like bitumen from sand and soil and upgrading it into
refinery-ready synthetic crude is more energy intensive and emits more carbon
dioxide than conventional oil production.

In a release, Shell said it would work with stakeholders to strengthen carbon
dioxide emissions policies and was looking to the government to establish its
rules.

"The need to reduce emissions is too important to rely on voluntary commitments,
and along with the rest of the industry we are now focused on meeting these new
regulatory targets," the company said.

Bob Curran, a spokesman for Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board, said
it is reviewing the coalition's application. He did not say when a decision
would be made.

Shell has a 60% stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, which includes an oil
sands mine near Fort McMurray and an upgrader near Edmonton. Its partners, each
controlling 20%, are Chevron Corp. and Marathon Oil Corp.

The 100,000 barrel per day expansion would boost output from the project to
255,000 barrels a day, and includes a new mining project and additional capacity
at the Scotford upgrader. The project is expected to be complete late next year.

Fact Sheet Issued for L Area Southern Groundwater

SECTION: LEGALS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 461 words


Operable Unit at Savannah River Site

The United States Department of Energy, United States Environmental Protection
Agency, and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
announce the availability of a Pre-construction Fact Sheet for the L Area
Southern Groundwater Operable Unit (LASG OU). This fact sheet provides a
description of the remedial actions selected for the LASG OU at the Savannah
River Site (SRS).

The LASG OU is a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act/Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (RCRA/CERCLA) unit. The
L Area Southern Groundwater OU (LASG OU), a RCRA/CERCLA unit, is located in the
south central portion of the Savannah River Site (SRS). LASG OU comprises
approximately 950 acres between the groundwater divide north of L Area and the
channel of Steel Creek beneath L Lake.

L Reactor and the surrounding facilities produced special nuclear materials for
national defense from 1954 until 1988. The refined contaminants of concern
(RCOCs) (tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and tritium) were
released to the environment at these L Area facilities and migrated to the water
table aquifer in sufficient quantities to exceed the maximum contaminant levels
(MCLs) in three well defined plumes. These plumes have been characterized by 93
groundwater monitoring wells and 109 cone penetrometer technology (CPT) tests.
The source units for the three plumes have been remediated under previous
records of decision (RODs), depleted, or reconditioned for new missions.

The remedial action (RA) selected for LASG OU is monitored natural attenuation
with institutional controls (MNA/ICs). The principal processes for natural
attenuation of the RCOCs are dispersion, dilution, and radioactive decay. The
anticipated future land use for the LASG OU is industrial. Land use controls
will be implemented and maintained to prevent exposure of current or future
workers or hypothetical future residents. Groundwater modeling indicates that
contaminant levels in the western tritium plume will be depleted below MCLs in
about 30 years and in the commingled VOCs and tritium plumes will be depleted in
about 90 years.

The Pre-construction Fact Sheet for the SRS L Area Southern Groundwater OU is
available at the following locations: DOE Public Reading Room at the
Gregg-Graniteville Library at the University of South Carolina (USC)-Aiken
campus in Aiken, SC; Thomas Cooper Library Government Documents Department at
USC in Columbia, SC; Reese Library at Augusta State University in Augusta, GA;
and Asa H. Gordon Library at Savannah State University in Savannah, GA.

ERCB: Shell Quest CCS Project Approved with Conditions

LENGTH: 295  words


New Delhi, Aug. 16 -- The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) has issued
Decision 2012 ABERCB 008, which includes conditions, for Shell Canada Limited's
application for a carbon capture and storage project north of Edmonton.



The hearing panel determined it is in the public interest to proceed with the
project, noting the proposed reservoir is a suitable location for the long-term
storage of carbon dioxide and the combination of geological conditions,
engineering design, operational practices, and extensive monitoring program
mitigate any potential risks the project might pose.

The ERCB applied 23 conditions on its approval of the project, primarily
regarding additional data collection, analysis, and reporting. Shell must also
obtain separate approvals for any additions to the project.

The ERCB held a hearing in Redwater from March 6-9, 2012, to consider the
applications and any concerns from interveners. ERCB hearings are formal,
quasi-judicial proceedings during which evidence is given, and cross-examination
and argument takes place.

Prior to issuing its final approval, the ERCB is required to refer the
application to Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development for
review. Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development may impose
additional conditions with respect to the environment, which will be added to
the ERCB's approval.

The ERCB is Alberta's primary energy regulator. For almost 75 years, we have
been committed to our mission: to ensure that the discovery, development and
delivery of Alberta's energy resources take place in a manner that is fair,
responsible, and in the public interest. In assessing the public interest, the
ERCB has regard for public safety, environmental stewardship, and resource
conservation.

REPORT ON CANADA   Alberta power plant

BYLINE: GAM

LENGTH: 101 words


A hearing by Alberta 's Energy Resources Conservation Board on when to
start building the second unit of the Genesee power plant has been delayed
for three months.

The first unit of the coal-fired Edmonton Power plant is to start
producing electricity in October.

It was hoped construction of the second unit would begin in May and
that it would open in 1991. A board hearing to confirm that plan was to be
held March 20.

The board, however, has agreed to a three-month delay pending appeal of
a Public Utilities Board decision not to allow Edmonton Power to recover
Genesee's costs from all Alberta power consumers.

BGreen caught up with Holley Chant, KEO International's Corporate Director of
Sustainability, ahead of this year's edition of EcoConstruct, to run through key
topics facing green construction

BGreen: What are some of the key requirements for optimal thermal insulation?

Holley Chant: With the ever increasing focus on resource conservation and
optimised performance in building legislation, proper design and material
selection is key to meeting the most stringent sustainability regulations.
Thermally insulating a building's facade is a cheap and efficient way of
reducing the huge waste in energy experienced each day in a harsh climate such
as the UAE. The main focus for building designers should be to achieve a low
overall facade U-value that not only reduces heat loss but also protects the
building and its occupants from solar gain. This can be achieved by specifying
insulation and glazing that not only insulates but also reflects solar heat.
These insulating materials should be highly durable, with zero Ozone Depletion
Potential (ODP) and a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of less than five.
Designers and developers in this region should be aiming for a facade U-value of
below 0.3 W/m2/K and a glazing Uvalue of between 1.6 - 2.0 W/m2/K. The solar
heat gain coefficients used to rate glazing for their solar protecting
properties should be in the region of 0.2-0.4. Insulating products of this
nature are readily available in the UAE market today, products and suppliers can
be located in the Dubai Municipalities green materials guide available on their
website.

BGreen: How can the public sector enforce an industry-wide standard for thermal
insulation?

Holley Chant: By implementing and enforcing an internationally recognised
building code that has best practices for thermal insulation included in it,
similar to what is mentioned above. The Abu Dhabi Department of Municipal
Affairs has a wonderful initiative for Abu Dhabi to adopt the International
Building Code, or IBC. The IBC has many criteria that would lead to use of
design methods and materials that produce better thermal insulation results in
buildings. But the IBC goes beyond thermal insultation-The goal of the DMA IBC
is to promote costeffective buildings with greater durability. They do this by
covering all aspects of buildings, from energy conservation to safety from
hazards like fire. As such a regionally optimised industry-wide standard for
thermal insulation would promote both energy efficiency and structural
durability. Further, Abu Dhabi has a wonderful platform for conservation in the
Pearl Rating System administered by the Estidama team at the Abu Dhabi Urban
Planning Council. There is a section in the Pearl Building Rating System which
focuses on the energy efficiency of buildings in which the industry-wide thermal
insulation standard can be included as one of the requirements to achieve a 1
Pearl Rating.

BGreen: To what extent does the private sector influence the forming of green
building regulations?

Holley Chant: The private sector can certainly support forming of green building
regulations by having corporate social responsibility commitments to uphold
international best practice in how we design and construct the built
environment. That way we are prepared to be able to apply international best
practice in our execution of our duties as engineers and architects. Further,
the private sector can seek out opportunities to help build a green economy by
supplying the goods and services required behind green building regulations.
It's already happening in the Gulf and I am proud that Abu Dhabi has been in the
forefront of this transformation.

As part of a new format this year, a series of presentations and seminars will
be held within an open theatre on the exhibition floor throughout the event.
These quickfire sessions will run concurrently over three days (16-18 April
2013), and are available free of charge to ecoConstruct Expo visitors. This
year's edition will feature presentations by Robert Cooke, Associate,
Sustainability and Alternative Technologies, Buro Happold; Stewart Cash, Partner
and Head of Cost and Commercial, EC Harris; William Whistler, Managing Director,
Green Building Solutions International; Ivar Krasinski, Design Director,
STREDGE; Sherif Anis, President, AIA Middle East, A chapter of the American
Institute of Architects, and other leaders of industry.

California State Legislature bill updates 11/03/2015; Assembly BillNo. 213
Introduced by Assembly Member Ridley-Thomas

LENGTH: 866  words

DATELINE: Sacramento


California State Legislature has issued the following bill updates:

Assembly BillNo. 213
Introduced by Assembly Member Ridley-Thomas
February 2, 2015
An act to add Section 25402.12 to the Public Resources Code, relating to energy.

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 213, as introduced, Ridley-Thomas. Energy efficiency: light emitting diode
(LED) lighting products.

Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission to prescribe energy efficiency standards, including standards
applicable to lighting products.

This bill would prohibit the commission from adopting a color rendering index
(CRI) value greater than the CRI value set forth in the United State
Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, as of January 1, 2015, as a
part of energy efficiency standards for lighting products, unless the commission
makes certain findings.

Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local
program: no.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
P1    1
SECTION 1.

(a) The Legislature finds and declares both of
2the following:

3(1) Historically, the energy efficiency standards prescribed by
4the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
5Commission pursuant to Section 25402 of the Public Resources
6Code have reduced energy consumption, saved consumers money,
P2    1and promoted adoption of advanced technology. The commission's
2efforts have led the nation in energy conservation.

3(2) However, the commission's recent and pending regulatory
4actions pertaining to light emitting diode (LED) lighting products
5will have the opposite effect by imposing restrictions on those
6lighting products that will needlessly raise the price of lamps,
7reduce energy savings, and retard the adoption of advanced
8technology products by consumers.

9(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to do both of the following:

10(1) Reaffirm its support for progressive energy efficiency
11standards, including those applicable to lighting products, but not
12if those standards make LED lighting products too expensive,
13sacrifice energy savings, and discourage purchase and adoption
14by consumers.

15(2) Adjust modestly standards applicable to LED light products
16to save consumers money, promote energy savings, reduce
17electricity bills, and encourage the adoption of LED lighting
18products by consumers.

26light engine," "LED light engine with integrated heat sink," or
27"LED luminaries" as defined in subdivision (n) of Section 1602
28of Title 20 of the California Code of Regulations.

29(b) The commission shall not adopt a color rendering index
30(CRI) value greater than the CRI value set forth in the Energy Star
31program, as of January 1, 2015, as a part of energy efficiency
32standards for LED lighting products, unless the commission makes
33all of the following findings:

34(1) Peer reviewed studies demonstrate that a CRI value greater
35than that required by the Energy Star program will increase the
36rate of consumer adoption and produce greater sales of LED
37lighting products.

38(2) Peer reviewed studies demonstrate that energy efficiency
39gains from consumer adoption of LED lighting products using a
40CRI value greater than that required by the Energy Star program
P3    1will exceed the energy efficiency gains that would result from
2consumer adoption of LED lighting products meeting the standards
3set forth in the Energy Star program.

4(3) Peer reviewed studies demonstrate that consumers are willing
5to pay an increased purchase price for LED lighting products with
6a CRI value greater than that required by the Energy Star program.

Site of historic landslide shifting; Monitoring of Turtle Mountain being stepped
up

BYLINE: Tony Seskus, Calgary Herald

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 1057  words


Roaring like thunder and moving like a freight train, a giant wall of rock
rushed down Turtle Mountain and struck the southwest Alberta community of Frank
with fury, wiping away dozens of lives in an instant.

It's been 105 years since that deadly rock slide shook the Crowsnest Pass, but
the disaster isn't merely a history lesson for the residents who still live in
the shadow of the mountain.

With a future slide considered to be ultimately inevitable, the Energy Resources
Conservation Board is expanding its high-tech network of monitoring tools to
better understand how the mountain is gradually shifting.

By the end of this summer, the number of monitoring stations on Turtle Mountain
will have doubled to 80.

"If you use the analogy that you're looking at the mountain as a hand, you're
monitoring a thumbnail," explained Corey Froese, an expert on Turtle Mountain
with the ERCB's Alberta Geological Survey.

"We're now monitoring the whole front of the hand -- the whole face of the
mountain -- and areas that, based on some of the mapping and our different
studies, we think either are moving or could move in the future." The program
builds on the provincial government's $1-million investment in 2003 to implement
a state-of-the-art predictive monitoring system, which dotted the peak with
devices -- like tiltmeters and crackmeters -- that keep tabs on the mountain.

The efforts have been welcomed by many of the 6,000 residents of Crowsnest Pass,
which is now considering a bylaw to restrict development in an area near the
mountain where there's a tiny cluster of homes.

"It's world-class," Mayor John Irwin said of the monitoring system that keeps
tabs on Turtle Mountain. "It (a rock slide) is not likely to be in my lifetime,
but it could be next year. We don't know. But we do know that in all likelihood,
it will happen." Fortunately, the community stands a much a better chance of
knowing in advance of when the next rock slide will occur, thanks to the
monitoring system that's been implemented.

Barring an unexpected earthquake, "we do expect that we would have days to weeks
of lead-up to provide notice to the residents," Froese said.

That wasn't the case April 29, 1903.

At 4:10 a.m., 30 million cubic metres of limestone and shale roared broke from
the face of Turtle Mountain and crashed across a three-kilometre span of the
valley, touching the sleeping coal-mining town of Frank.

While the slide missed most of the community of 600 residents, it crashed over
miners' cottages, temporary dwellings, a farm and a railway camp. More than 70
people died.

"Nobody had any warning except for the men in the mine -- who noticed some
strange movements, but they never thought it was going to be a rock slide," said
Monica Field, who manages the Frank Slide Interpretive Centre overlooking the
awesome debris field the slide created.

A century later, the Energy Resources Conservation Board is using some of the
best technology in the world to reduce the risk of future surprises. If there's
significant activity, officials like Froese will get instant notification any
time of day.

That happened once last year.

"One day at three in the afternoon, I get a phone call from a colleague that's
also on this system, saying something is moving," Froese said.

"We both got in front of our computers and quickly looked at it. We said, 'This
appears to be real.' " They immediately checked other sensors and found nothing
troubling, but they kept watching for a week.

"It never made it out of our office because it wasn't a concern for a global
failure," Froese explained.

"But . . . it's nice to actually have things like that to give you confidence"
about the system.

The monitoring is also helping scientists gather valuable insights into how the
mountain is moving. It's shown the peak is creeping slowly by a couple of
millimetres a year.

But that work, as well as cutting-edge mapping, led the board to expand its
monitoring network beginning last summer.

"We realized that we needed to step back and really be comfortable that we were
monitoring everything that should be monitored," Froese said. "There were
potentially larger issues that we hadn't appreciated before and so in order to
really understand those issues, we've expanded our network." Darin Barter, a
spokesman for the conservation board, said it all boils down to public safety.

"This project really is all about protecting the people at the base of this
mountain," Barter said. "There's a number of families, there's a number of
individuals, who live at the bottom. We need to make sure that their location
isn't putting them at risk." In the interest of safety, the local municipal
council is also considering a bylaw that would restrict development in an area
that's thought could be in the path of a future slide. There are about 10 homes
in the area. The proposed bylaw would, among other things, prevent any further
subdivision of existing certificates of title in the area. It would allow
residents to rebuild their homes should they be damaged in some way, like fire.

The bylaw has gone through first reading, but is scheduled to return before
council later this month.

The community's mayor explained that with all of the information available now,
there is a responsibility to keep citizens out of harm's way.

"We can't reach and retroactively change what's happened in the past, but we can
set out systems to minimize potential threat and danger in the future," Irwin
added.

"We don't want to interfere with the enjoyment of life and property of the
people living in the area. We want to make sure we can get them out of there
before it comes down -- if and when that happens." But the bylaw doesn't make
much sense to some of the residents who live in the potentially affected area.

Roy Lazzarotto, 76, chuckles when asked whether he's nervous about where he
lives. The longtime resident, who proudly mined in the region for decades, has
been up and around the mountain over the years.

While Lazzarotto believes that there will be a rock slide someday, he's certain
the home he's lived for the past 16 years is "as safe as a church." And he notes
that there have been restrictions in the area before. If the bylaw proceeds, he
thinks it will someday be changed again.

"There's no way that mountain comes down here," he said.

"Don't you be scared." tseskus@theherald.canwest.com

Nova sees ethane stand threat to Alberta sector

BYLINE: KEVIN COX; GAM

LENGTH: 659 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


BY  KEVIN COX
 The Globe and Mail
  CALGARY
  A $2-billion expansion of Alberta's petrochemical industry has been
jeopardized by the Energy Resources Conservation Board 's refusal to
guarantee the flow of ethane, a crucial element to the project, Nova Corp.
says.

In a strongly worded statement, Nova said that if the board's
recommendations are accepted by the Alberta Government: 'The impact on
the growth of Alberta's ethane-based petrochemical industry would be
catastrophic. Even the existing ethane-based petrochemical industry would
be seriously eroded."

However, Richard Hillary, spokesman for the Independent Petroleum
Association of Canada, praised the decision and said Nova's position is
'a major piece of political brinkmanship."

He said producers are pleased they will have the freedom to build
plants to sell the ethane to markets other than the petrochemical
industry.

'Nova is only trying to preserve for the future a niche with a  preferential
price and an assured supply," he said.

The AERCB was asked last fall by Alberta Energy Minister Neil Webber to
referee the increasingly bitter dispute between natural gas producers and
Nova, the major petrochemical producer in Alberta.

Since 1975, the province has guaranteed Nova's two petrochemical plants
a supply of ethane, a natural gas component essential to Nova's production
of plastic for everything from garbage bags to children's toys.

The ethane is stripped off at plants that straddle the gas pipeline in
southern Alberta. But gas producers now see a lucrative market in enhanced
oil-recovery projects for the ethane and asked the AERCB to recommend
removal of all provincial assurances of future ethane supply to Nova.

The AERCB concluded that the provincial policy giving Nova first dibs
on the ethane should not be extended to new petrochemical developments. It
also said that prices for future ethane should be negotiated between
producers and the petrochemical industry with no interference by the
province.

If accepted by the Alberta Government, the recommendations would
effectively deny the proposed project the protections that Nova chairman
Robert Blair credits with helping found the petrochemical business in the
province.

'The board believes that it would be in the public interest if the  proponents
of such a plant . . . negotiated with potential producers and  contracted for
needed feedstock before the plant was built."

The board also said it was not convinced a third ethane-based
petrochemical plant would be held back if no ethane volumes were set for
it.

But it acknowledged that the exclusion of a third plant from an assured
supply of ethane 'could well represent a short-term setback to the
petrochemical industry in the province."

Nova executives wasted little time in responding to the board's
recommendations, meeting with AERCB chairman Gerald DeSorcy yesterday
morning.

Mr. Blair said in an interview yesterday that the board has been unable
to explain to him how the expanded industry would be able to function if
it had to rely on the outcome of negotiations with producers for its
feedstock.

He said ethane represents only about 3 per cent of the producers'
revenues from natural gas, while it is an essential element to Nova's
petrochemical endeavors, which only recently have become very profitable.

Mr. Blair said Nova has heard some concern from its partners about the
board's recommendations affecting the future of the petrochemical project,
where construction could have started as early as 1989.

'We are very worried about the future availability of ethane to the
petrochemical industry, the petrochemical business is being severely  challenged
to say the least."

Mr. Blair said Nova does not want to overdramatize the seriousness of
the situation and will be trying to convince the provincial Government not
to heed the board's recommendations.

Mr. Webber has said he will hold meetings with the industry over the
next several weeks before announcing the new provincial ethane policy.

Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan

Early Construction Operation and Disposal Sites

L-1, N-2, P-2, and R-1A, R-1B, R-1C Site Evaluation Areas

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) will release a Statement of
Basis/Proposed Plan on June 25, 2009, describing the proposed remedial approach
for the Early Construction Operation and Disposal Sites (ECODS) L-1, N-2, P-2
and R-1A, R-1B, R-1C Site Evaluations Areas (SEAs) at the Savannah River Site
(SRS). The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
(SCDHEC) will also release a draft Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
permit modification for the proposed remedial action for this unit. These
documents will be available for public review and copying at the locations
listed below. The public comment period is scheduled for June 25, 2009 to August
8, 2009.

The Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan was completed to meet the terms of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), a
law governing the investigation and cleanup of waste units. The Statement of
Basis/Proposed Plan and draft RCRA permit modification also meet the terms of
RCRA.

DOE has worked with the United States Environmental Protection Agency-Region 4
(EPA) and the SCDHEC to ensure the remedial approach is consistent with all
applicable environmental requirements. DOE, EPA, and SCDHEC have reviewed the
risks associated with the SEAs and have evaluated cleanup alternatives. The
final action of Institutional Controls is recommended for ECODS L-1, N-2, P-2
and R-1A, R-1B, R-1C.

ECODS L-1 is located in the southern portion of the SRS immediately east of
L-Area and was used from November 1953 to June 1954. ECODS L-1 consists of two
trenches, and each trench is approximately 60 ft wide by 150 ft long. ECODS N-2
is located in the central portion of the SRS near the southwestern edge of the N
Area. ECODS N-2 was used from January 1953 to May 1955. The trench is
approximately 525 ft long and 150 ft wide. ECODS P-2 is located in the
southeastern portion of the SRS, immediately south of P Area. ECODS P-2 was used
from approximately January 1953 to May 1955. The trench is 165 ft long and 50 ft
wide. ECODS R-1A, R-1B, R-1C are located in the southeastern portion of the SRS
and immediately northeast of R Area. ECODS R-1A, R-1B, R-1C was used from
approximately September 1951 to August 1952. ECODS R-1A, R-1B, R-1C consist of
three trenches. The trenches are within an area that is approximately 400 ft
wide by 200 ft long. The ECODS were typically used as burial pits for debris
prior to production start up in various areas and usually included burning of
the debris.

These ECODS contain slightly elevated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), metals including arsenic, low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
and potentially friable asbestos. The surface soil concentrations for these
constituents are below residential and industrial preliminary remedial goals
(PRGs). In addition, these constituents are below the principal threat source
material (PTSM) thresholds and do not represent a migration potential that
warrants action. However, due to the potential presence of friable asbestos in
subsurface soils, institutional controls will be implemented to prevent land
disturbance activities and to prevent exposure to subsurface contaminants.

Comments on the Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan and the draft RCRA permit are
requested by August 8, 2009. Upon completion of the public comment period, a
Responsiveness Summary that addresses public comments will be prepared. The
Responsiveness Summary will be made available with the Record of Decision and
the final RCRA permit modification and will be sent to each person who submits
comments.

Copies of the Statement of Basis/Proposed Plan are available in the
administrative record, which also contains the Site Evaluation Report for this
unit. The administrative record is available in the information repositories
listed below:

San Mateo County's list of "green" businesses is expanding

BYLINE: By William C. Humston San Mateo County Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 473 words


For A + Japanese Auto Repair in San Carlos, being "green" has gotten easier with
time.

"The biggest challenge was taking the first step," said Eric Sevim, co-owner and
shop manager. "Sure, we had to dedicate plenty of time, money and resources, but
the payoff makes us feel good and helps our bottom line."

The auto repair shop was among 63 small- and medium-sized businesses that were
recently recognized by the San Mateo County Green Business Campaign for their
efforts to adopt environmentally friendly practices.

The program, launched two years ago by county Supervisor Mark Church, requires
businesses to complete a checklist of measures and undergo compliance in four
areas of resource conservation: energy, water, pollution prevention and waste
reduction.

"This program has expanded from just 16 businesses certified less than a year
ago to 63, with another 100 businesses in queue," said Kim Springer, resource
conservation program manager for the county Department of Public Works.

Recognized green certified businesses like A + Japanese Auto Repair have made
broad changes to meet higher standards of environmental performance by reducing
waste and pollution.

Eric Sevim and his brother Adam decided to sign up for the program when a high
school-aged employee pointed out the amount of waste generated through paperwork
and parts packaging.

"She made some phone calls and got us a recycling bin," said Sevim. "We filled
it in two days.

With the help of Allied Waste, a metal recycler, and a tire recycler, the repair
shop implemented a full recycling program for almost every material used in the
shop.

A + took advantage of rebate programs from Pacific Gas & Electric Co., replacing
252 four-foot fluorescent bulbs with high-efficiency bulbs, along with new
ballasts. They also reduced their water consumption by replacing toilets, faucet
heads and by issuing coupons to a local green-friendly car wash, rather than
washing customer cars in the shop.

"Automotive repair is an inherently toxic industry with a large carbon foot
print," said Sevim. "We want to change that."

San Francisco International Airport has set a goal to have its tenant businesses
green-certified in just a few years and has been pushing environmental efforts
at the site for some time.

"We've always been environmentally minded," said Wayne Chang of Osho Japanese
Cuisine in the International Terminal. "The Green Business Campaign auditors
came in and pointed out ways to improve what we were already trying to do."

The program offers business-specific guidance and resources generated from a
local database of recycling facilities, donation centers and green products
helping businesses like Chang's go from green-friendly to green-certified in a
matter of months.

Businesses interested in the program can visit RecycleWorks.org Web site and
submit an application.

Controversial Alberta natural gas ruling sparks industry fears   over sales
efforts

BYLINE: DREW FAGAN; GAM

LENGTH: 329 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


BY  DREW FAGAN
 The Globe and Mail
  CALGARY
  The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has clarified a
controversial decision limiting natural gas exports, but it does nothing
to allay fears among many producers that the ruling could damage their
sales efforts.

The AERCB surprised the industry last week by reducing, by nine years,
the term of a contract signed by Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. to supply energy to
the burgeoning California market.

The well-respected provincial government agency did so by citing a
long-established 15-year permit policy for allowing natural gas exports,
one that many producers feel should disappear because of the deregulated
gas environment.

Pan-Alberta had believed the ruling was also based on an AERCB
assessment that the company did not have sufficient reserves to meet the
contract.

But the AERCB noted yesterday that reserves are not a problem and were
not an issue in the ruling, a clarification that Pan-Alberta vice-
president Walter Litvinchuk said would go a long way toward eliminating
the sudden fears of Pan-Alberta customers.

'It simply turned out to be a misunderstanding," he said.

Since the ruling, a few energy companies that recently signed 20-year
deals with U.S. suppliers have expressed concern that they may also be
limited in their marketing efforts by the AERCB 15-year policy.

And while the AERCB has pledged to review that policy in the coming
year, Pan-Alberta's intended California customer is talking to other
suppliers to fill the possible gap.

Southern California Gas Co. is one of the largest buyers of natural gas
in the United States. It wants to put in place long-term contracts for its
core market.

Mr. Litvinchuk said provincial government officials are aware of the
negative reaction to the ruling.

The provincial cabinet can overturn such a decision by the AERCB, but
it almost never does.

In the meantime, however, Pan-Alberta plans to continue efforts at
getting approval for the full life of the contract, which runs to 2012.

Local SWCD office taking applications for EQIP initiatives

BYLINE: The Jena Times staff

LENGTH: 567  words


The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) is a voluntary conservation
program that helps agricultural and forestry producers improve water and air
quality, build healthier soil, improve grazing and forest lands, conserve
energy, enhance organic operations, and achieve other environmental benefits.

The LaSalle Soil and Water Conservation District office accepts applications for
EQIP funding throughout the year in a continuous sign-up process; however,
throughout the year NRCS schedules ranking periods for applications.

In order to address targeted resource concerns in Louisiana, the Natural
Resources Conservation Service has allocated EQIP funding for several special
initiatives and established two application cutoff dates for these funds.

"It is important for producers to visit our offices and complete an application
for EQIP special initiative funding by March 15 to be considered in the current
ranking period," said Clyde Irvin, District Conservationist. "Any applications
received after March 15, 2013, will be considered in the next special initiative
application ranking period which ends April 19, 2013."

Special initiatives offered through EQIP include:

On-Farm Energy Initiative to help producers conserve energy on their operations;

Seasonal High Tunnel Initiative to help producers install high tunnels designed
to extend the growing season into the cold months, increase productivity, keep
plants at a steady temperature and conserve water and energy;

Organic Initiative to help producers install conservation practices on certified
organic operations or those working toward organic certification;

Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative to help producers in
targeted watersheds improve water quality in the Mississippi River Basin;

Gulf of Mexico Initiative to help producers in targeted watersheds improve water
quality in the Gulf of Mexico;

Longleaf Pine Initiative to help forest land producers improve the
sustainability and profitability of longleaf pine ecosystems;

Master Farmer Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative to help
participants of the Louisiana Master Farmer Program implement practices within
their existing

Resource Management System Conservation Plan and address identified resource
concerns;

Statewide Wildlife EQIP Initiative to focus funding for wildlife conservation;
and

Beginning Farmer/Rancher and Socially Disadvantaged Farmer/Rancher Initiative to
focus EQIP funding for historically under-served farmers and ranchers.

May's crude shut-in figure   set 20% lower by AERCB

BYLINE: DJ

LENGTH: 397 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


Dow Jones Service
  CALGARY
  The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has set light and medium
crude oil production shut-in for May at 92,463 barrels a day.

The May figure is down 20 per cent from April's shut-in of 115,736 b/d.

May is the last month of the ERCB's current supplemental crude oil
sales program, which allows the sale of production-ordered shut-in by the
board once primary market commitments are met.

As of June 1, shut-in sales will be unregulated once 597,550 b/d of
light and medium crude nominations are submitted for the primary markets
of Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest.

The AERCB, which regulates light and medium crude production, set its
market-demand order in May at 700,077 b/d, up 1.5 per cent from the
board's order of 689,384 b/d in April. Total nominations were 792,540 b/d,
up 12.9 per cent from April nominations of 702,033 b/d.

Though light crude nominations are up from the previous month, the
AERCB noted that Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. of Toronto, the sole link
between Alberta and its major markets in Eastern Canada and the United
States, has 31,450 b/d of available capacity in May.

IPL, which has partially completed an expansion of its capacity, has
had chronic capacity problems in recent years. The anticipated surplus,
some industry officials say, is tied to a slight downturn in sales of
heavy Canadian crude oil for delivery in May, which has opened up some
capacity on the system.

Rangeland Pipe Line Co. of Calgary and Vancouver-based Trans Mountain
Pipe Line Co. Ltd. - which service the Montana area of the United States
and Vancouver, respectively - will also have surplus capacity in May, the
board said.

The Rangeland system will have about 22,000 b/d of spare capacity and
Trans Mountain about 44,000 b/d. The surplus pipeline capacity should
allow sales of shut-in crude production, industry officials said.

A number of industry officials say they anticipate that a spot market
for surplus light and medium Canadian crude oil will begin developing if
the IPL system continues to report surplus capacity in the coming months.

The AERCB also notified feeder pipeline operators in Alberta for the
second consecutive month that they must have board approval for
supplemental crude shipments before the sales can be consumated. Industry
officials say the board is attempting to keep a closer rein on shut-in
production until deregulation takes effect.

StrikeForce aims to help reduce rural poverty in Utah

BYLINE: Whitney Evans Deseret News

LENGTH: 627 words


SALT LAKE CITY ? Gilbert Harris, 70, and his wife manually watered their 10
acres of alfalfa and Native American corn for most of his farming career. It
took them five days every two weeks. Through funding provided by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service, Harris installed gated irrigation a little more
than five years ago and reduced the time he spent watering by one to two days.

?All these people are here to help you, but you have to put it together. We
found out that is the secret,? Harris said in a video created by the Natural
Resources Conservation Service. Utah is one of 10 states selected by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to participate in the StrikeForce initiative, created
in an effort to boost economic development and job creation. StrikeForce began
in 2010 in Arkansas, Mississippi and Georgia, and expanded to Colorado, New
Mexico and Nevada in 2011. The Department of Agriculture selects states based on
U.S. Census Bureau reports that show consistently impoverished rural areas.
Through StrikeForce, farmers such as Harris and other businesses in rural areas
can become aware of available resources while partnering with one of three U.S.
Department of Agriculture agencies in Utah ? the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, Farm Service Agency and Rural Development. The agencies collectively
help by providing microloans to beginning farmers and businesses, teaching
farmers how to improve productivity and energy efficiency, and developing new
construction projects in rural areas. Now, these agencies will combine forces to
meet the needs of the rural communities. ?I think you could actually build a
town with our programs,? said Dave Conine, state director of Rural Development
in Utah. Utah will focus on the Navajo nation in San Juan County first because
it is the only county in the state that meets criteria for persistent poverty.
This means 20 percent or more of the population has been living in poverty for
the past 30 years, as measured by census reports.  San Juan County has 29.9
percent of its population living at or below the poverty line, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau's small area income and poverty estimates.   Any person who
does not have enough income to buy food, shelter, clothes and other ?essential
goods and services? qualifies as poor, according to the Census Bureau.  The
poverty line is at $11,161 for one person and $25,603 for two adults and three
children, according to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.  The three
agencies will identify farmers or other individuals who could benefit through
the programs. The Governor's Office of Economic Development would then provide
technical assistance throughout the application process, said Beverly Evans,
director of Rural Development in the Governor's Office of Economic Development.
Additional tax dollars generated through successful farmers and businesses will
indirectly benefit the rural communities, she said.   The initial focus of the
initiative in Utah is to get the word out about the programs to San Juan and
other rural counties.  The Census Bureau's small area income and poverty
estimates show high poverty levels in other rural counties in Utah, with Piute
County at 21.1 percent, Iron County at 21.1 percent and Sanpete County at 17.8
percent. Any program that creates new jobs helps the entire economy, said Jeff
Edwards, CEO of the Economic Development Corporation of Utah. As a nonprofit
organization that works to develop competitive companies throughout the state,
the Economic Development Corporation of Utah believes that a rising tide floats
all boats, Edwards said. In other words, as San Juan County's economy improves,
Utah?s economy will benefit, too. E-mail: wevans@deseretnews.com Twitter:

Environmental groups oppose Amoco drilling

BYLINE: Katherine Bell Canadian Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 51

LENGTH: 459 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Alberta Environment Minister Brian Evans is making a sham of hearings into a gas
exploration proposal by giving approval in principle beforehand, say opponents.

''Frankly we're flummoxed by Mr. Evans's remarks,'' George Newton of a
loose-knit group called Friends of the Whaleback said yesterday. ''We believe
that Mr. Evans . . . is prejudging the results of the ERCB hearing.''

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board is to begin hearings Monday on a
proposed Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. test well in an ecologically sensitive
region of southwest Alberta.

But some residents and environmental groups say development will ruin a unique
area.

Evans insisted the approval is a normal part of a company's application process.

''We look at the surface disturbance and whether it can be mitigated, and we
give a conditional approval so the next stage can be sought . . . to drill the
well,'' he said yesterday in Edmonton.

Amoco believes the area could contain 1.2 trillion cubic feet of sour gas,
which must be processed to remove deadly hydrogen sulphide. The project could
create 1,500 jobs over 20 years.

If the test well pans out the company hopes to limit environmental impact by
drilling 20 more wells from five sites.

''You would typically go in and drill 20 vertical wells but we are proposing
that if the geological rock formations permit we would try to drill those from
as few as five locations,'' Amoco's Vince Rodych said, adding the plan needs
further study to see if it is technically possible.

Opponents say the area is Canada's largest intact example of a montane ecosystem
and shouldn't be forever scarred by a roads and wells.

The montane, a transition area between prairie and mountains, is a rich habitat
that offers food and protection for carnivores, birds and hoofed animals. It
contains grasslands, wildflowers, pine and Douglas fir trees.

''We have very little montane left,'' said Newton, co-ordinator of the Alberta
Environmental Network in Edmonton. ''And we just feel that some areas have to be
beyond industrial development.''

Newton said the Whaleback should be protected under the province's so-called
special places 2000 plan to set aside more land.

''How can the government on the one hand be championing special places 2000 if
on the other hand it has neither the vision, the will nor the courage to protect
from industrial development this Alberta gem?''

The proposed exploratory well is outside an ecological reserve, Evans said, but
''it may well be that the Whaleback will fit into the special places
philosophy.''

There is already a road and trail system into the test site so the proposed
exploration wouldn't have significant impact, he said.

Refiners need more than pipe can deliver

BYLINE: John DeMont

SECTION: SECTION 3, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 43, OIL ACTION

LENGTH: 521 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  ALBERTA'S PIPELINE network faces an ironic problem. Demand for the province's
crude is particularly strong these days. But Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. of
Edmonton (34.5% owned by Hiram Walker Resources Ltd., and 21.8% owned by
Imperial Oil Ltd.), which moves most of the Alberta and Saskatchewan oil to
Eastern markets, doesn't have the capacity to keep up with refiners' needs.

Light crude producers have so far borne the brunt of the pipeline bottleneck. In
April, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) was forced to
order a 65,000 barrel-per-day cutback in production of light crude, up from
25,200 b/d held back in March.

Oil men, obviously, were displeased with the situation. Gulf Canada Resources
Ltd. had to cut production by an average 6,000 b/d last month. Texaco Canada
Resources Ltd. the country's largest oil producer, was forced to hold back 5,000
b/d. Home Oil Co., a subsidiary of Hiram Walker Resources Ltd., with 95% of its
daily production falling into the light oil category, shut in 800 b/d.

The Canadian Petroleum Association (CPA), which represents most of the larger
Canadian oil companies, estimated the congestion cost the industry $2.3 million
a day in lost revenues during April.

For now, the transportation problem seems to have temporarily eased. With
Alberta refineries taking an unusually large amount of crude and the supply of
light oil down because of maintenance-related shutdowns of field operations, the
ERCB has given permission to resume full production for May.

But even the board admits that the present situation is unlikely to continue. In
fact, matters stand to get dramatically worse as the summer progresses. For one
thing, volumes moving through the pipeline are expected to rise after June 1,
when the oil industry is deregulated and controls on pricing and volumes are
removed.

In addition, new production is coming on stream. This summer, phase one of Esso
Canada Resources Ltd.'s Cold Lake project will begin pumping an estimated 20,000
b/d into the system. Another 19,000 b/d will soon be flowing from Esso's newly
completed Norman Wells project.

''Things are going to be very tight, there is no doubt about it,'' says Hans
Maciej, the CPA's technical director.

The approaching crunch has been apparent for some time. Facing strong demand for
the thick, slow-flowing heavy crude, Interprovincial Pipe Line was counting on a
steady decline in light oil production to prevent any transportation capacity
problems. That hasn't occurred.

To solve the long-term problem, IPL is planning a two-phase $114-million
expansion to its system, which will give it the capacity to handle an additional
200,000 barrels daily. But it will be another 18 months before the new capacity
is in place.

In the meantime, producers and regulators are frantically scrambling for some
short-term solutions. The possibilities include reopening inactive 50,000 b/d
Wascana pipeline from Regina to Poplar, Mont., or pumping more oil through Dome
Petroleum Ltd.'s Rangeland line which runs from Sundre, Alta., to Billings,
Mont.

Can green features sell your house?

BYLINE: Heather Vogel For the Camera

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 706 words


W ill green features help you sell your home?


As with all home improvements made with an eye to later sale, the answer is --
it depends.



 Big investments such as solar panels undertaken right before a sale probably
won't be a cost-effective investment. However, adding some simple green features
may make your house appealing to potential buyers.





 Appeal is the key word. The way the current home appraisal system is set up,
green fixtures are not factored directly into calculating a home's market value.
However, some environment-conscious features may give a house on the market an
edge over otherwise similar properties.



 Matt Kolb, broker and owner of Pedal to Properties in Boulder, says that when
looking for green features in a home, it's less about dollars and cents and more
about the buyer's belief system. "(They think) 'Maybe not so much if it's going
to save me another $50 or $100 a month, but is this something I stand for, and
that's really what it's about,'" says Kolb. Ultimately if a buyer cares about
the environment, he or she will consider green features in their decision. If
they don't, the features probably won't sway them towards one house or another.



 When trying to market and sell a home, realtors tend to focus on the highlights
and features of the home, says Kolb. Generally speaking, a house full of energy
efficient LED or CFL lighting doesn't make the cut.



 "Light bulbs just typically don't turn people on," says Kolb, "But on the other
end of the spectrum, if there's an energy efficient water heater and the house
is south facing, those are the things that really stand out for people."



 Kolb listed a number of green improvements that can make a home  more appealing
to buyers. Insulation, whether it's in the crawl space or along a window seam,
it's a feature that buyers appreciate. Plus, it's fairly easy and cheap to
install. Weather stripping and door sweeps also fall under the easy and
inexpensive category.



 Depending on your budget and the number of windows your home has, investing in
storm windows may be worthwhile when looking to sell. Bigger upgrades such as
replacing an old furnace with a new energy efficient model will very likely be
highlighted by realtors, and can easily be paired with a thermostat time to
further control energy consumption. But look closely at the expense.



 Kolb also strongly recommends that all homeowners get an energy audit, whether
they are looking to sell their home or not. Energy audits are inexpensive and
even free in some areas and take about two hours. Inspectors will point out
modifications, both big and small, that can be made in order to make your home
more energy efficient.



 Kate Gardner, the water programs manager at Boulder County's Center for
ReSource Conservation, believes that homeowners should also get an indoor water
inspection. For Boulder residents, these inspections can be arranged through the
Center for ReSource Conservation for $70. The fee covers the inspection of a
home's showers, toilets, sinks, and washing appliances, as well as the
replacement of fixtures such as water-wasting showerheads and sink aerators.



 "Just by replacing aerators and shower heads, the average home will save $65 a
year off their water bill," Gardner says.



 But will buyers consider these changes when searching for a home? Will they
even know about them?



 "These are all wonderful features and we all have a value for them, but the
problem is the appraisers do not put a value on them," says David Scott, of
Colorado Landmark Realtors. "It's only going to increase the value if the person
buying it sees the value."



 Scott explains that the system used by local realtors to list properties does
allow for some green features to be searched, but neglects others. He says that
there is also a trend in real estate of green washing so it's important that
homes are third party certified. Otherwise a search of the word "green" may
bring up homes that may not have any green features besides the lawn.

This home at 820 33rd St. in Boulder, has improved insulation, a tankless water
heater, evaporative cooling, an energy-efficient furnace, low flow water
fixtures, xeriscaping, no or low VOC paint, sustainable flooring and several
other green features.

Energy efficiency the California way

BYLINE: Colin Isaacs for The Financial Post

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 12, Environment

LENGTH: 413 words

DATELINE: Anaheim, CA


If you thought interest in energy conservation peaked during the oil embargo of
the mid-1970s, you're wrong.

That was the message used by Carson Culbreth, a director of the National
Association of State Energy Officials, to open the Association of Energy
Engineers convention in Anaheim this week.

He told the gathering that interest in energy efficiency is at a peak.
Efficiency and conservation have never played a more important role in economic
development than they do today.

The message was echoed by Ken Gudger, vice-president, energy efficiency and
market services, of Southern California Edison Co. If SCE-sponsored energy
efficiency programs had not been in place, the utility would have sold six
billion kilowatt hours more of electricity in 1993. Total sales were 75 billion
kilowatt hours.

Just taking fuel costs into account, the additional electricity would have cost
the Southern California economy an extra US$250 million. Almost all electricity
used in the region comes from imported fuel.

Gudger described more than a dozen energy efficiency programs that SCE has under
way. Wind and solar account for 20% of total energy sold by the giant utility.

Experience with these efficiency programs has taught Gudger that energy
efficiency is not about kilowatt hours or equipment specifications. Instead, it
is about selling and marketing.

He said that one well-known department store chain in California had shown no
interest in low-energy lighting. Then an SCE official calculated how many
dresses and slacks it would have to sell to achieve the same net return as it
would get by installing high efficiency lighting. The company not only jumped at
the opportunity locally, but asked SCE to help convert all its stores across the
country.

Shivu Desai, a project engineer at Southern California Gas, described the
''three Es'' of technology development: Economics, energy efficiency and
environmental compliance.

Based on this model, the company has partnered development of technologies
promising dramatic improvement in energy efficiency. Proposed new technologies
must be cost-effective, use energy efficiently with proven systems, not
futuristic dreams, and comply in a holistic way with increasingly stringent
environmental requirements.

Yet even with energy efficiency programs, southern California energy demand is
expected to grow from seven quadrillion British thermal units today to more than
10 quads by 2009.

BANKSIA AWARDS WELL DESERVED

Banksia Environmental Foundation was established.

It makes a series of annual awards to recognise the conservation achievements of
individuals, companies, local councils, government departments and the media.
This year, Noosa Shire Council scored in the Local Government category and
Silvio's Dial-a-Pizza won the Energy and Resource Conservation category.

SILVIO Bevacqua's big smile is not the result of a booming pizza delivery
business.

It's there because a dramatic decision taken three years ago to become
environmentally-conscious has paid off.

There is the reward and satisfaction of being recognised for his company's
efforts to be the best in Australia in the Energy and Resource conservation
category.

But, just as important, Silvio has proved changes instigated to help the
environment have also proved financially rewarding.

""Silvio's became the first fast-food chain in the country to recycle steel cans
and ban plastic garbage bags," he said.

""It then began using recyclable, non-bleached cardboard for its pizza boxes."

Environmentalists Lose Cases On Hazardous-Waste Control

BYLINE: Daniel B. Moskowitz

SECTION: FINANCIAL; PAGE F24

LENGTH: 806 words


Some facilities generating hazardous ash are exempt from the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) strictures on managing such waste, two
separate U.S. District Courts recently ruled.

The decisions, from courts in New York and Chicago, were a setback for a
campaign by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to get more controls on the
plants. In both cases, the facilities produce energy from waste collected from
households, hotels and restaurants.

EDF v. Chicago involves a municipal plant that processes 350,000 tons of garbage
a year; EDF v. Wheelabrator, centers on a privately owned plant that is even
bigger, handling 650,000 tons of solid waste annually.

Generally, household waste is automatically deemed non-hazardous, and, while
RCRA imposes regulations on disposal, it is not covered by the subtitle of the
statute that lays out out safety procedures to be followed in managing more
dangerous wastes.

In 1980 regulations interpreting that law, the Environmental Protection Agency
gave an expansive reading to that exemption, applying it throughout the entire
process of disposing of household waste, including the ash resulting from
incineration.

Environmentalists at EDF argued that those regulations apply only to handling
waste, not to generating new waste. That, they insist, is what the waste-to-
energy facilities do. They actually produce a residue that the environmentalists
call hazardous.


The EPA says that hazardous ash generated from household waste is not
automatically exempt from RCRA regulation. But EPA has issued various opinions
on the issue, leaving the judges, at least, convinced that the government is a
bit confused. For that reason, both the New York and Chicago November opinions
specifically refuse to give EPA the usual deference accorded a federal
regulator.

In other cases, courts ruled that:

A newcomer to a market won't be much hurt by a preliminary injunction against
further sales. Preliminary injunctions are meant to be a quick response to a
problem, to last until the underlying issues can be decided at a full trial. The
U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond said that it was proper to issue such a bar to
U.S. sales of an O-shaped hard roll candy from Spain that the makers of Life
Savers thought was confusingly like their established brand.

The appellate judges noted that consumers were likely to mistake the Spanish
Circos for Life Savers, but also noted that the U.S. importer of the candy would
suffer little injury from an injunction since it has such a tiny slice of total
candy sales.

(Nabisco v. Conusa, Dec. 1) Expenses racked up before a business is opened can
never give rise to tax deductions. The U.S. Tax Court had ruled in 1983 and 1984
that under some circumstances, payouts needed to get an operation going can be
deducted as business expenses, even though the taxpayer was not actually in
business at the time the costs were incurred.

But the Internal Revenue Service consistently refused to accept that position
and at least five of the regional appellate courts also rejected the position.

Now the Tax Court has decided to bow to the prevailing opinion and has reversed
the 1983 and 1984 rulings to the extent that they approved deductions of some
preopening expenses.

(Hardy v. Commissioner, Dec. 13) A company may be deemed a "debt collector" when
trying to get its own customers to pay up. Generally, the strictures in the Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act about what can and cannot be said in a dunning
letter are fashioned for collection agencies and do not apply to a company's
internal debt-collection efforts.

But the U.S. District Court in Albany says that exception does not help New York
Telephone Co. escape charges that it violated the act.

The letter in question was written by a lawyer who heads the utility's
collection department, but New York Tel's logo was not on the stationery and the
man was identified merely as an attorney. That would lead some consumers to
think that the letter is from an outside firm doing collection work, Chief Judge
Neal P. McCurn decided.

(Britton v. Weiss, Dec. 7) Fired workers do not get much protection from the
Bankruptcy Code. Since 1984, it has been against the law to dismiss an employee
"solely" because he or she has filed for bankruptcy. In 1987, the U.S. District
Court in Savannah interpreted that provision to bar any firing in which the
employee's insolvency "played a significant role."

But the latest ruling, from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, rejects that
reading and says "solely" means "solely" -- the firing is allowed as long as the
company has some other legitimate reason, even if that reason, alone, would not
have resulted in dismissal.

(Laracurent v. Chase Manhattan, Dec. 5)Daniel B. Moskowitz is a Washington
editor for Business Week newsletters.

Nova regulation scrutinized

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 375 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman will consider merging Alberta's two energy
regulatory boards into a single body with expanded powers.

The suggestion, one of several alternatives mapped out in an Alberta Energy
Resources Conservation Board report on the NovaCorp. gas pipeline system that
was released yesterday, could address both petroleum and electricity industry
concerns about regulatory duplication, Orman said in an interview yesterday.

At the same time, the formation of an Alberta ''super energy regulator'' -
perhaps an Alberta Energy Commission - from a merger between the AERCB and the
Alberta Public Utilities Board could help the province fend off National Energy
Board efforts to win partial jurisdiction over the Nova system.

''We guard jealously our ability to govern, legislatively, Nova. I would not
like to see regulatory oversight of Nova fall into the hands of another
jurisdiction,'' Orman said. ''A combined regulatory board is a suggestion that
piques my interest.''

The NEB has scheduled a hearing this fall to consider whether parts of the Nova
system that would supply the proposed Altamont export pipeline should fall under
federal regulatory scrutiny.

At present, the Nova system operates in something of a regulatory vacuum. The
AERCB report described it as the only pipeline system in North America that sets
its own tolls and rate of return and prescribes its own terms and conditions of
services.

Nova does this through special committees that hold discussions with its gas
producer customers. Regulators only step in if the two sides fail to reach an
agreement. But recently, some gas producers have claimed that Nova makes life
difficult for customers that complain.

Nova's gas transmission division president Bruce Simpson said the company is
prepared to work with a merged regulatory board. However, he favors continued
use of the committee structure to help eliminate costly and time-consuming
regulatory proceedings.

Orman said the committee approach has much to recommend it, and that he might
consider adopting it for Alberta's electricity industry.

The minister said he expects to make recommendations on revamping Alberta's
energy regulatory system by early fall.

Defense Pollution Cleanup Could Cost $ 100 Billion;
DOE, Pentagon Claim Immunity From EPA

BYLINE: Michael Weisskopf, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A25; THE FEDERAL PAGE

LENGTH: 621 words


The government's weapons production and military facilities have polluted the
environment with radioactive and hazardous wastes, causing damage that could
cost $ 100 billion to clean up, federal officials told a House subcommittee
yesterday.

But the Energy and Defense departments, which operate hundreds of facilities
contaminated by dangerous industrial substances, claim legal immunity from the
Environmental Protection Agency cleanup orders and lawsuits that polluters in
private industry face, according to the testimony.

"We can't do things we can do with private facilities," said Assistant EPA
Administrator J. Winston Porter. "The tool I have right now is jawboning."

The hearing was called by the House transportation, tourism and hazardous
materials subcommittee to consider bills designed to bring federal facilities
into compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
regulating the storage, handling and disposal of toxic waste.

RCRA calls on federal departments to "comply with all requirements," but it does
not spell out the EPA's powers of enforcement against sister agencies. The
Justice Department, citing the doctrine of sovereign immunity, holds that RCRA
violations at federal facilities are "interagency disputes" to be resolved by
the president and that the EPA has no power to force cleanups or seek court
orders.

The $ 100 billion price tag predicted yesterday by Energy Undersecretary Joseph
F. Salgado is the highest estimate yet for the cleanup of as many as 5,400
toxic-waste sites at federal facilities.

At the hearing, Assistant Comptroller General J. Dexter Peach accused the
Defense and Energy departments of "insufficient emphasis" in observing
environmental laws. He cited several examples of groundwater pollution,
including sites that may have become "irreversibly contaminated" by the nuclear
weapons production at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Wash., and the
Savannah River plant in Aiken, S.C.

Facilities operated by the Department of Energy in Colorado, South Carolina and
Tennessee have polluted the groundwater with hazardous solvents at levels up to
1,000 times higher than proposed drinking water standards permit, Peach
testified. In Washington state and South Carolina, he added, radioactive
materials contaminate groundwater 400 times higher than the standards.

"State officials are concerned that the existing contamination at many of the
DOE facilities may pose a public health threat and that DOE is adding to the
problem by continuing to discharge radioactive and hazardous material into the
environment," he said.

At Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, where toxic cleaning solutions were dumped
into the storm drainage system or spilled on the ground, pollution of the source
of drinking water reached an "unacceptable health risk," Peach said.

According to a committee staff report, 16 DOE and Pentagon facilities were cited
by EPA for RCRA violations since July 1984. Only four of them have agreed to
correct the deficiencies, a record that Rep. Dennis E. Eckart (D-Ohio) described
as "flagrant disregard."

"If a violation occurs, you bury it and find ways to bind EPA's hands," he said.

Defense Undersecretary Robert B. Costello testified that his department is
focusing resources on cleanup with the aim of becoming "good citizens."

The Energy and Defense departments deferred to the Justice Department's ruling
to explain why they should not be subject to EPA cleanup orders.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Roger J. Marzulla testified that under the
Constitution, "executive branch agencies may not sue one another, nor may one
agency be ordered by another" and that only the president can settle such
disputes.

Medford School District saving $200,000 annually through energy conservation
projects

BYLINE: Teresa Thomas, Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 834 words


March 14--Over the last two years, the Medford School District reduced its
summer electric bill by $37,672 by simply asking staff to unplug TVs, DVD
players, computers, chargers and other equipment in their classrooms before
leaving for the summer.

The summer shutdown is one of the "low-cost and no-cost projects" initiated by
Lief Hochendoner, the district's resource conservation/project specialist, to
conserve energy and save money that could be put to better use in the classroom.

"Most of the equipment out there has standby power," Hochendoner said. "Even
phone chargers, if left plugged in, are drawing power. In our case, all those
little things added up to a whole lot."

Shortly after being hired in 2013, Hochendoner formed the district's Resource
Conservation Program, which according to a report released by the district is
now saving $200,000 annually in electric, natural gas, water and waste costs.

In January 2015, the school district became the first in the state to enroll in
the Energy Trust of Oregon's Commercial Strategic Energy Management (SEM)
program.

"When (Energy Trust) approached us with the program, it fit in well with what we
were trying to accomplish," Hochendoner said. "And being that there was no cost
other than our time to attend meetings and training workshops, it made a lot of
sense for us to participate in the program."

As part of the program, Energy Trust tracked energy use at all 19 district
buildings, taking into account weather patterns and occupancy; trained
facilities teams on how to use the data to make operational and behavioral
improvements; and encouraged the district to update its conservation and
sustainability policy to include best practices, said Susan Jowaiszas, Energy
Trust's senior marketing manager.

"It's about how you run your buildings for maximum efficiency and figuring out
where waste is occurring so you can take steps to remedy that," she said.

Energy Trust also paid the district an incentive based on how much energy it
saved. In its first year, the district reduced its kilowatt-hour consumption by
nearly 10 percent, or one million kilowatt-hours. As a result, the district not
only saved $70,000 in utility costs, but also earned $22,000 in incentives.

One million kilowatt-hours, Jowaiszas explained, is equivalent to the amount of
energy needed to power 775 homes for a year, or 4,161 tons of carbon dioxide.

While the districtwide summer shutdown initiative accounted for about a third of
that energy savings, the rest was accomplished through low-cost and no-cost
projects, including ensuring doors and windows remain closed while the heating,
ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units are on, and scheduling the HVAC
units around when the buildings are occupied.

The district also disconnected 271 fluorescent hallway lights in Central Medford
High School and replaced 1,103 fluorescent light fixtures with brighter,
longer-lasting and more efficient LED lights.

The lighting upgrade, which is estimated to save the district between $20,000
and $30,000 annually, cost the district nearly $155,000. However, the bulk of
the expense was covered by a $112,542 Oregon Department of Energy Cool Schools
grant and an additional $38,700 in incentives from the Energy Trust, Hochendoner
said.

"So basically, while the project cost $150,000, the out-of-pocket cost for the
district was only about $2,000, and it's bringing almost $20,000 back to the
district every year in savings," said Ron Havniear, the district's support
services and facilities manager.

Other conservation projects included insulating the floor of Washington
Elementary School for an annual savings of $3,000, repairing water leaks
districtwide for an annual savings of $29,000, reducing the frequency of waste
pickups at some sites for an annual savings of $4,500, and replacing 18 windows
at McLoughlin Middle School to help maintain the temperature in the building.
(The savings for the latter project has not been calculated.)

The district also has plans to upgrade lighting at several other facilities,
replace two chillers, fine tune equipment so it runs more efficiently and
install a solar array at Ruch Community School, according to district
spokeswoman Natalie Hurd.

"All these projects save us money that we can put directly back into the
classrooms," Hurd said.

While many of the conservation projects were identified prior to the district
enrolling in the SEM program, the program provided additional data, as well as
the tools to further the district's efforts, Havniear said.

Energy Trust filmed a case study video to showcase Medford's successful
implementation of the SEM program. It will be available at the end of April on
the organization and school district's websites.

Alsands proposal wins nod   but board has reservations

BYLINE: Thomas Kennedy; SPCL

LENGTH: 672 words

DATELINE: Calgary AB


By THOMAS KENNEDY
                       Special to the Globe and Mail
  CALGARY - The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has officially
 recommended that the Albert Government approve a third oil sands
 production plant.

But the board has questioned crucial details of the proposed
 $5-billion project by the Alsands group, which could mean going back to
 the drawing board and almost certain delays unless the provincial Cabinet
 ignores the regulatory agency.

Earlier this year, the board indicated that approval of the
 140,000-barrel-a-day plant would be forthcoming. Construction of the
 plant is scheduled for 1985-86. The Government sees it as a cornerstone
 in the development of large-scale synthetic oil production in
 northeastern Alberta.

However, the board found that Alsands has seriously underestimated
 recoverable bitumen volumes; chosen the wrong site for some key parts of
 the facility; failed to submit acceptable mining plans; and proposed the
 use of an inefficient oil extraction technology that has not changed in
 decades.

Different oil price projections used by the applicant and the board
 had the net effect of decreasing or increasing the over-all bitumen
 recovery by 50 per cent.

The board thinks oil prices would rise faster than Alsands estimated
 (by an average 2 per cent in real terms annually) over the 20-year life
 of the plant. This would bring more of the oil-soaked substance within
 economic reach.

Also, the board objected to the plant site and the tailing pond to be
 used to store waste material because vast amounts of bitumen underneath
 could not be mined. At the same time, the board told Alsands that it is
 concerned over the lack of progress toward improving bitumen extraction
 technology.

A board spokesman said in an interview that the Clark hot water
 separation process (invented in the 1920s and used in the two other
 Alberta commercial oil sands plants) is not being improved.

The process poses environmental hazards, including the need to use and
 treat massive amounts of water, and it has a low rate of recovery.
  The board has directed Alsands to undertake research to reduce
 hydrocarbon waste in the tailings and lessen water consumption.

The board will not object to the use of the hot water bitumen
 extraction process, but it said future oil sands plants had better
 improve technology.

Meanwhile, the board insisted that Alsands rework all its mining
 techniques and possibly revise equipment plans for the vast open-pit
 mine, adjacent to the upgrading facility.

The board, at this time, regards the applicant's proposed mining
 system and long range mine plans as tentative.

A spokesman for Shell Canada Resources Ltd. of Calgary, the operator
 of the Alsands project, said the plant's economics will be reviewed
 immediately. But he warned that delays in an agreement to determine the
 exact plant location could delay site preparations scheduled for next
 year.

Alsands has tentative plans to move its extraction plant to permit the
 mining of underlying bitumen deposits at a later date.

In addition, the Alberta Government could make a more suitable plant
 site available off the Alsands leases near Fort McMurray. A provincial
 cabinet decision on the actual permit, including the suggested revisions
 by the board, is expected by spring.

In the meantime, the sponsors are unable to proceed with royalty and
 tax discussions with the federal Government because of the federal
 election campaign now under way. The group said it will go ahead with the
 project only if Ottawa and Alberta both agree to extend appropriate
 financial incentives.

The Alsands group includes Shell Canada Resources with a 25 per cent
 interest; Shell Explorer Ltd. of Houston 20 per cent; Calgary-based
 companies Amoco Canada Petroleum Ltd. 10 per cent; Chevron Standard Ltd.
 8 per cent; Dome Petroleum Ltd. 4 per cent; Gulf Canada Resources Inc. 8
 per cent; Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Co. Ltd. 8 per cent; Petro-Canada
 Exploration Inc., (formerly Pacific Petroleums Ltd.) 9 per cent; and
 Petrofina Canada Inc. of Montreal 8 per cent.

Bill on Newspaper Recycling

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1


A House committee endorsed legislation today to require large newspapers to
either use more recycled paper or tell readers at the top of page one that they
are not meeting the new standard.

The provision, an amendment to legislation overhauling the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The amendment, approved 32 to 10, would require that newspapers with an average
daily circulation of 200,000 or more use at least 35 percent recycled fiber by
1995. The requirement would jump to 50 percent in 2002.

Aides to Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who introduced
the amendment, said six of the nation's 56 largest newspapers now meet the 1995
standard.

Under the proposed measure, if a newspaper failed to meet the content
requirement, it would have to print "prominently at the top of the front page of
the newspaper" that it "does not meet the Federal Government's required
percentage of recycled content."

In other action on the bill, the panel killed an attempt to increase recycling
by requiring Americans to pay a 10-cent deposit on each packaged beverage they
buy. Customers would have had the deposit refunded when they took their empties
to collection centers or returned them to stores.

The provision, which would have taken effect if states failed to reach a 70
percent recycling rate, was defeated 27 to 16.

New Orleans-based Taylor Energy faces lawsuit over damaged wells

LENGTH: 256  words


The Waterkeeper Alliance and several local Waterkeeper organizations filed suit
against Taylor Energy Co. of New Orleans on Thursday for failing to stem oil
allegedly gushing from damaged wells off the Louisiana coastline for seven
years.

The national clean water advocacy group partnered with the Louisiana
Environmental Action Network in Baton Rouge as well as SouthWings, a
conservation group that tracks environmental issues via flight, and Skytruth,
which uses satellite images to do the same, to file the suit.

The group, which calls itself the Gulf Monitoring Consortium, is targeting 28
Taylor Energy wells about 11 miles off the coast of Louisiana that were severed
by an undersea landslide in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Ivan.

It accuses Taylor Energy and state regulators of failing to stop the daily flow
of oil from the site allowing hundreds of gallons of oil per day to leak off the
coast since 2004. The group says it has been documenting an ongoing spill at the
site through aerial monitoring flights and analysis of satellite imagery.

The ongoing oil spill, they say, is in violation of the Clean Water Act and the
Resource Conservation Recovery Act.

The suit comes on the heels of a Louisiana State Court of Appeal ruling that the
state must test the environmental impact of treated waste water from oil and gas
production activity within Louisiana territorial waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
The decision was a win for environmental groups that claim the practice is
contaminating seawater and wildlife along the coast.
