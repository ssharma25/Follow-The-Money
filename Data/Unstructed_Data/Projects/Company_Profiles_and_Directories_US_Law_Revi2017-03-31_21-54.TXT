Energy expo seeks to protect environment by educating consumers

BYLINE: Kristen Gaydos, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 641 words


Jun. 14--Having an energy audit done is the best way for a homeowner to learn
what energy-efficient improvements would be beneficial to them, said Kevin
Sterowski, owner of Northeast Tankless Water Heater Supply Co. Homeowners can
get discounted loan rates and rebates from the federal and state government for
those improvements.

Visitors can also earn credits for continuing their education from Wilkes
University. Those who attend sessions at the expo will receive a certificate for
continuing education units. The number of units issued will depend on the number
of sessions attended, according to event officials. The councils are a U.S.
Department of Agriculture program which help local people care for natural
resources. For information, visit the Pocono Northeast Resource Conservation &
Development Council at www.pnercd.org, or the Endless Mountain Resource
Conservation & Development Council at www.endlessmountainsrcd.org.

Residents from throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania on Saturday learned ways to
stop energy loss and make their homes more efficient at the first Energy
Solutions Expo at the Luzerne County Fairgrounds in Dallas.

More than 50 exhibitors were available at the expo to talk about how they can
save money and the environment. The expo continues today and is hosted by the
Pocono Northeast Resource Conservation & Development Council and the Endless
Mountain Resource Conservation & Development Council.

Sandy Bubuka, of Trehab Renewable Energy, discussed the many ways to save
energy, such as installing a solar water heater, insulating recessed lights and
using a programmable thermostat to control when the heat turns on.

"Low flow faucets and shower heads will save you a lot of energy wasted," she
said.

Rick Grant, a member of the Pocono Northeast Council, said the council decided a
energy expo would be a valuable asset for residents after the success of a farm
expo a few years ago.

"They wanted something that would impact more people," he said.

Improving a home using energy-efficient materials and technology is becoming
more popular, Grant said, as the government gives out grants for several
upgrades. Homeowners are also searching for more ways to save money on energy
bills, especially with PPL rate caps set to expire at the end of the year.

"Nobody is ready for that around here," Grant said.

Having an energy audit done is the best way for a homeowner to learn what energy
-efficient improvements would be beneficial to them, said Kevin Sterowski, owner
of Northeast Tankless Water Heater Supply Co. Homeowners can get discounted loan
rates and rebates from the federal and state government for those improvements.

Oil and gas database

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 43, Western News

LENGTH: 164 words


The National Energy Board and Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board have
signed an agreement to share geologic and reservoir information for natural gas
and crude oil pools. They said yesterday the proposed sharing of information
''will result in a common reserves database for Alberta.'' The agreement
provides for joint reserves studies, sharing and joint development of software
and the establishment of a ''joint reserves steering group,'' consisting of up
as many as three appointees from each board, with a mandate to harmonize methods
of estimating and treating reserves data and to develop more efficient methods
of maintaining data. The agencies said they will also consider expanding the
database to include natural gas liquids, to examining the feasibility of
modifying the database to reflect corporate supply in the system, and to
examining the impacts of new reserves definitions recently released by the
Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Tata Power's Club Enerji Organizes a Resource Conservation Rally to Sensitize
the Citizens of Kandivali, Mumbai

LENGTH: 498  words


New Delhi, Aug. 4-- Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation
movement, has gained tremendous impetus due to the focus and dedication of
school children to spread awareness about energy and resource conservation
across the country.

Over 150 students from 2 schools St. Lawrence High School and Ryan International
School from Kandivali East came together today to spread the message on Resource
conservation. The students enthusiastically prepared posters, banners and
placards with paintings depicting various ways to conserve the environment. Each
school also prepared unique banners with their school names prominently
displayed.

The students then marched on a rally through the Thakur Village circuit in
Kandivali East shouting various slogans and spreading the message on
conservation of natural resources through their own posters, placards and
handouts. They also distributed paper bags to citizens en-route.

Speaking on this initiative, Mr Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power
said, "The enthusiasm, involvement and dedication of the school students to
spread the message on energy conservation is remarkable and has contributed
towards making this a national movement. We would also like to thank the
teachers and principals of the schools for constantly extending their support to
this initiative. This year we have taken the program to a higher level and have
introduced new modules on resource conservation and moral & civic value."

Club Enerji has covered 400 schools and sensitized more than 2.8 million (28
lakh) citizens across the nation and over 3 million units of electricity have
been saved till date. The Club is proud to have more than 19095 Energy Champions
and 32257 Energy Ambassadors this year who are spreading the mantra of energy
conservation among people across various age and income groups. Today, there are
more than 800 mini clubs across the country, which are run by the school
children with the aim to stop wastage of electricity.

Club Enerji encourages students to form their own mini energy clubs in their
school and societies, to propagate the message of energy conservation to
citizens and society at large. Club Enerji also has various nationwide
engagement programmes like Energy-Q (Quiz competition), Spark of Life (Poster
making contest), Every Watt Counts (Essay Competition), newsletter, and an
exciting website. With informative and interesting publications like Energy Book
- 'Watts up with Energy?' activity booklets, audio-visuals and anthem.

The Resource conservation module lays emphasis on of course saving electricity
along with saving fuel, water, paper, trees and advocating judicious waste
management practices, reducing plastic consumption. Every year keeping power
conservation as a key pillar, Club Enerji will focus on one other resource to
combat climate change. This year Fuel Conservation will be included in this
module and it's only apt when fossil fuels are becoming scarce and expensive
with each passing day.

Grits clamor for removal of Kowalski

BYLINE: KIM LUNMAN AND ALAN BORAS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1/ FRONT

LENGTH: 736 words


Liberals renewed their can-Ken calls Tuesday after revealing the province's
former deputy premier made government decisions affecting the watchdog agency he
will head in his new job.

And as attacks in the legislature continued, a second former head of the Energy
Resources Conservation Board came forward to criticize Ken Kowalski's
appointment.

"This has the potential to damage the reputation of the board," said Gerry
DeSorcy, who Kowalski replaces as chairman of Alberta's energy regulator.

Opposition critics on Tuesday called on Premier Ralph Klein to rescind his $
110,000 job offer to Kowalski, saying the veteran Tory MLA -- dubbed "minister
of everything" -- approved and authorized six permits from the Energy Resources
Conservation Board since last year.

At a news conference, interim Liberal Leader Bettie Hewes released documents
from Tory cabinet meetings between November and December 1993 that show Kolawski
approved the permits.

"It's clear, in fact, the minister did have significant dealings with the ERCB,"
she said. "This information proves that. How the premier could not know that is
really beyond me."

It was the second day in a row Klein came under attack in the legislature for
appointing Kowalski chairman of the new Alberta Utilities and Energy Board, a
merger of the Public Utilities Board and the Energy Resources Conservation
Board.

On Monday, Klein said Kowalski was "never at any time substantively or directly
involved with the ERCB or the Public Utilities Board . . . in any way, shape or
form."

Klein continued to defend the appointment Tuesday, saying it is up to the
province's ethics commissioner to determine if he violated Alberta's
Conflict-of-Interest Act by hiring Kowalski.

"Let him adjudicate this matter," Klein said, adding he has no choice but to
abide by the ruling.

Ethics Commissioner Bob Clark will determine if the appointment breaks a rule
that calls for cabinet ministers to wait six months after they leave office
before taking a government post in an area in which they have had substantial
involvement.

Kowalski, who had not yet resigned as MLA for Barrhead-Westlock Tuesday, has
said he will start his new job as soon as Nov. 1.

Klein said the ERCB permits sponsored by Kowalski as minister of economic
development in cabinet meetings were housecleaning matters that do not add up to
substantial involvement.

However, he later admitted ministers would have to be familiar with the orders
they are signing.

"I'm sure that they're familiar, they know the issue per se, but I don't think
they become involved in the day-to-day issues," he told reporters. "I've signed
many, many administrative orders and I have no idea what the details (are) or
the administrative work that goes into those kinds of things."

The premier has been accused of "cronyism" for appointing his former right-hand
man. Kowalski abruptly left the cabinet last week amid speculation he was forced
out in a power struggle.

Kowalski has refused to comment on the appointment.

Former ERCB chairman and longtime board member George Govier has slammed the
appointment as "little short of scandalous," saying it threatened the autonomy
of the quasi-judicial body.

DeSorcy said even if Kowalski leads the board in a fair and independent manner,
the AEUB will suffer a perception problem.

"I'm concerned that they won't be seen that way and that they won't have
credibility.

"It's the appearance that concerns me most of all," said DeSorcy, who was a
petroleum engineer on the ERCB staff for 20 years and a board member for 18
more. He retired in 1993.

DeSorcy's second fear is that the petroleum regulator will no longer be able to
recruit and keep highly qualified professionals, such as engineers and
geologists, who may hope for promotions to the board.

"One of the strengths of the board has been its ability to retain a core of very
capable people."

Kowalski, who until last Friday was deputy premier, never applied for the job.

DeSorcy is also troubled with breaking from the tradition of never selecting
politicians or industry veterans to head the ERCB, opting instead for
scientists, academics or career civil servants.

Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said
Tuesday he believes the AEUB will remain a world-class regulator despite the
appointment of a politician to its helm.

business enterprises, as defined, in all categories, including, but not limited
to, renewable energy, advanced technologies, and demonstration projects, and
furnish an annual report regarding the implementation of programs established
pursuant to this requirement. The bill would require the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission to establish guidelines for all grant or
loan recipients to utilize in establishing programs pursuant to these
requirements. The bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission to develop, and would require every grant or loan
recipient to implement, an outreach program to inform and recruit women,
minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises to apply for
procurement contracts. The bill would require the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission to establish a Diversity Task Force to
consider and make recommendations about diversity in the energy industry,
including diversity of corporate governing boards and procurement from diverse
businesses.

plan for increasing procurement from women, minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT
business enterprises, as defined, in all categories, including, but not limited
to, renewable energy, advanced technologies, and demonstration projects, and
furnish an annual report regarding the implementation of programs established
pursuant to this requirement. The bill would require the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission to establish guidelines for all grant or
loan recipients to utilize in establishing programs pursuant to these
requirements. The bill would require the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission to develop, and would require every grant or loan
recipient to implement, an outreach program to inform and recruit women,
minority, disabled veteran, and LGBT business enterprises to apply for
procurement contracts. The bill would require the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission to establish a Diversity Task Force to
consider and make recommendations about diversity in the energy industry,
including diversity of corporate governing boards and procurement from diverse
businesses.

Reserves declining

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6, CANADIAN BUSINESS BRIEFS

LENGTH: 86 words


  The latest estimates by the Energy Resources Conservation Board show
continuing declines in Alberta's conventional oil and natural gas reserves. The
board said the rate of further additions to gas reserves is linked closely to
the pace of drilling activity and a large potential remains to be tapped. If
there were no further additions to conventional crude oil and gas reserves and
if they were produced continuously at current levels, these reserves would last
about 10 and 18 years, respectively.

Tata Power's Club Enerji organizes a Resource Conservation Rally to Sensitize
the Citizens of Mira Road, Mumbai

LENGTH: 410  words


New Delhi, Sept. 26 -- Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation
movement, has gained tremendous impetus due to the focus and dedication of
school children to spread awareness about energy and resource conservation
across the country.



Over 300 students from St. Xavier's school Mira Road came together today to
spread the message on Resource conservation on the occasion of No Car Day. The
students enthusiastically prepared and displayed posters, banners and placards
with paintings depicting various ways to conserve the environment and reduce the
use of fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel.

The rally began with a special street play in which the student's presented ways
to minimize the usage of private vehicles to reduce environment pollution. The
students then marched on a rally to create mass awareness. They enthusiastically
shouted various slogans while spreading the message on conservation of natural
resources through their own posters, placards and handouts.

Speaking on this initiative, Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power
said, "The enthusiasm, involvement and dedication of the school students to
spread the message now on not just energy but resource conservation also, is
remarkable and has contributed towards making this a national movement. We would
also like to thank the teachers and principal of the school in extending their
support to this initiative."

Club Enerji has covered more than 400 schools and sensitized more than 2.8
million (28 lakh) citizens across the nation and over 3 million units of
electricity have been saved till date. The Club is proud to have more than 19095
Energy Champions and 32257 Energy Ambassadors this year who are spreading the
mantra of energy conservation among people across various age and income groups.
Today, there are more than 800 mini clubs across the country, which are run by
the school children with the aim to stop wastage of electricity.

Club Enerji encourages students to form their own mini energy clubs in their
school and societies, to propagate the message of energy conservation to
citizens and society at large. Club Enerji also has various nationwide
engagement programmes like Energy-Q (Quiz competition), Spark of Life (Poster
making contest), Every Watt Counts (Essay Competition), newsletter, and an
exciting website. With informative and interesting publications like Energy Book
- 'Watts up with Energy?', activity booklets, audio-visuals and anthem.

California State Legislature bill updates 03/03/2015; Assembly BillNo. 1330
Introduced by Assembly Member Bloom

LENGTH: 1820  words

DATELINE: Sacramento


California State Legislature has issued the following bill updates:

Assembly BillNo. 1330
Introduced by Assembly Member Bloom
February 27, 2015
An act to add Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8400) to Division 4.1 of the
Public Utilities Code, relating to energy.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 1330, as introduced, Bloom. Energy Efficiency Resource Standard Act.

Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority
over public utilities, including electrical corporations and gas corporations,
as defined, while local publicly owned electric utilities, as defined, and local
publicly owned gas utilities are under the direction of their governing boards.
The Public Utilities Act requires the Public Utilities Commission to review and
accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical corporation in
accordance with specified elements, incentive mechanisms, and objectives,
including a showing that the electrical corporation will first meet its unmet
needs through all available energy efficiency and demand reduction resources
that are cost effective, reliable, and feasible. The act requires the Public
Utilities Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, to identify all potentially achievable
cost-effective electricity efficiency savings and to establish efficiency
targets for electrical corporations to achieve pursuant to their procurement
plan. The act requires the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with the
State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to identify all
potentially achievable cost-effective natural gas efficiency savings and to
establish efficiency targets for gas corporations to achieve and requires that a
gas corporation first meet its unmet resource needs through all available gas
efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost effective, reliable, and
feasible.

Existing law requires each local publicly owned electric utility, in procuring
energy, to first acquire all available energy efficiency and demand reduction
resources that are cost effective, reliable, and feasible. Existing law
additionally requires each local publicly owned electric utility to report
annually to its customers and to the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission, its investment in energy efficiency and demand reduction
programs, which report is to include a description of programs, expenditures,
and expected and actual energy savings results. Existing law requires a local
publicly owned electric utility to be responsible for implementing an energy
efficiency program that recognizes the Legislature's intent to encourage energy
savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions in existing residential and
nonresidential buildings, and to include in the above-described report, its
status in implementing the program.

The existing Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Act establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission. Existing law requires the Energy Commission, on or before November
1, 2007, and every 3 years thereafter, in consultation with the Public Utilities
Commission and local publicly owned electric utilities, in a public process that
allows input from other stakeholders, to develop a statewide estimate of all
potentially achievable cost-effective electricity and natural gas efficiency
savings and establish statewide annual targets for energy efficiency savings and
demand reduction over 10 years.

This bill would enact the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard Act. The Public
Utilities Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, would be responsible for supervising
the implementation of the act by electrical corporations and gas corporations.
The governing board of each local publicly owned electric utility and local
publicly owned gas utility, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, would be responsible for the
implementation of the act by the utility. The bill would require the State
Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, in a public
stakeholder engagement process, to determine how the energy savings goals of the
act are measured and reported. The act would require each electric utility and
gas utility, as defined, to establish an energy efficiency resource standard
that shall increase the amount of energy efficiency resources of the utility so
that the total amount of incremental energy savings achieved in any given year
amounts to not less than specified amounts. The bill would require the Public
Utilities Commission to require that Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern
California Edison Company, and San Diego Gas and Electric Company jointly
achieve a reduction in nonemergency, event-based demand response of 7% by 2020
and 10% by 2025, as measured by the sum of their peak demands. The bill would
require that not less than 25% of the energy savings of an electric utility or
gas utility come from disadvantaged communities identified by the California
Environmental Protection Agency, as specified. The bill would require each
electric utility and gas utility to annually file with the State Energy
Resources Conservation and Development Commission, a report that analyses the
energy savings achieved by the utility during the prior year, divided by the
energy consumption in the immediately preceding year.

Under existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand,
or requirement of the commission is a crime.

Because a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing the
bill's requirements with respect to an electrical corporation or gas corporation
would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by
creating a new crime. By placing additional requirements upon local publicly
owned electric and gas utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local
program.

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and
school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions
establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for
specified reasons.

Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local
program: yes.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
P3    1
SECTION 1.

Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8400) is

David and Vicky Barker will open their fifth-generation dairy farm to the public
Friday and Saturday for Maine Farm Days.

Natural Resource Conservation Service soil conservation technician Paul
Carmichael said there will be vendors and a variety of educational activities,
including a wagon tour, children's learning center, pesticide credit workshops
and speakers.

He said Maine Farm Days is a great way for the public to witness agricultural
technology and learn about farming.

''It's been going on for over 50 years,'' Carmichael said of Maine Farm Days.
''It's a chance for farmers to socialize. They'll have some agriculture vendors
and have folks like ourselves, the Natural Resource Conservation Service who
work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, giving presentations.''

He said the theme for this year's show is alternative and renewable energy.
Presentations will include wind and solar energy and carbon sequestration from
groups such as the Androscoggin Land Trust, Maine Farmland Protection and
Androscoggin Valley Soil and Water Conservation District.

David Barker said the farm participated in the Natural Resources Conservation
Services' Environmental Quality Incentive program to develop adequate waste
storage facilities and a rotation grazing system to help protect a stream.

''Technical and financial assistance from the Natural Resources Conservation
Services is essential to establish improved conservation measures,'' Barker
said. ''The escalating costs of fuel and feed have offset any gains in milk
prices. This emphasizes the importance of cost-sharing assistance for the
installation of conservation measures.''

Carmichael said the day will run from 9 a.m. until 4:40 p.m. About 3,000 to
5,000 people attended the event last year, and ''this year, I'm hoping for
7,000,'' he said.

The 800-acre farm is located at 9 Baker Rd. in North Leeds, east of Route 106
and north of the railroad tracks that cross Route 106.

ACTIVISTS CALL FOR HALT TO DEEP-WELL DISPOSAL

BYLINE: DENNIS HRYCIUK, EDMONTON JOURNAL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 369 words


Provincial regulators have backed away from new rules over deep-well oilfield
waste disposal after criticism from environmental groups at an Edmonton meeting.

But the environmentalists called Thursday for a moratorium on further deep-well
disposal of potentially hazardous materials until public hearings are held.

The environmental safety of the 3,750 wells scattered around Alberta hasn't been
determined, environmentalists believe. The oil industry now pumps materials such
as antifreeze, pesticide and herbicide into wells 600 to 3,000 metres deep.

Taxpayers should also be concerned about having two provincial agencies handle
environmental regulations, said Brian Staszenski, executive director of the
Environmental Resource Centre in Edmonton.

The two are the Energy Resources Conservation Board, which regulates the
petroleum industry, and the Natural Resources Conservation Board, which rules
over other industries. "This is creating two bureaucracies," Staszenski
commented.

Oil industry officials, however, said the ERCB should continue its role because
it has the best knowledge about how the industry operates.

And no further review is needed because of studies showing that existing
waste-containing wells have proven to be safe, said Kelly Moynihan, a spokesman
for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

New, tougher regulations for disposing of oilfield waste in the deep wells were
to have taken effect Sept. 1. But that won't happen until further public
reviews, said Don Beamer, an official with the province's Energy Resources
Conservation Board.

He commented Thursday, a day after a closed-door meeting with environmentalists
in Edmonton -- who had complained about not being consulted before the
regulations were established.

Describing the meeting as a "barn burner," Staszenski said participants asked
for a full review to consider alternatives to deep-well disposal.

The proposed new regulations left unclear what types of wastes could be pumped
into such wells, he noted. Lax monitoring and inspection of existing wells was
another concern. "Given our concerns, we feel there should be a moratorium on
hazardous waste disposal in the wells."

National Energy Saving Week: 'Oorja Samvardhan Divas' marked

LENGTH: 271 words

DATELINE: Jamshedpur


Jamshedpur, Jan. 9 -- Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation
movement celebrated 'Oorja Samvardhan Divas' at D.A.V. Kapildev Public School,
Ranchi to mark the beginning of the National Energy Saving Week. Spouses of Tata
Power employees became the torch-bearers of the Club Enerji's efforts towards
conservation and educated students with valuable practices to conserve energy.

Speaking about the successful initiative, D Santra, head-Tiruldih Project - Tata
Power said, "Tata Power has always been committed to the cause of energy saving
and has propagated resource conservation practices since its inception. It is
imperative to train and educate the young citizens about energy and resource
conservation and motivate them to collectively work towards energy and resource
preservation for the greater good of our planet. We thank D.A.V. Kapildev Public
School and the volunteersfor their participation and enthusiasm which has helped
makethe event a huge success."

The students actively participated and interacted with the educators during the
sessions. The students were encouraged to accept Mr. Enerji as their friend and
guide in energy and resource conservation and to sincerely follow the golden
rules. The educators also sensitized the students on the existing energy crunch
in the country. A session was held on the benefits of adoption of
technologically advanced equipment and non-renewable sources of energy.

California State Legislature bill updates 03/03/2015; Assembly BillNo. 1330
Introduced by Assembly Member Bloom

LENGTH: 1820  words

DATELINE: Sacramento


California State Legislature has issued the following bill updates:

Assembly BillNo. 1330
Introduced by Assembly Member Bloom
February 27, 2015
An act to add Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8400) to Division 4.1 of the
Public Utilities Code, relating to energy.
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 1330, as introduced, Bloom. Energy Efficiency Resource Standard Act.

Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority
over public utilities, including electrical corporations and gas corporations,
as defined, while local publicly owned electric utilities, as defined, and local
publicly owned gas utilities are under the direction of their governing boards.
The Public Utilities Act requires the Public Utilities Commission to review and
accept, modify, or reject a procurement plan for each electrical corporation in
accordance with specified elements, incentive mechanisms, and objectives,
including a showing that the electrical corporation will first meet its unmet
needs through all available energy efficiency and demand reduction resources
that are cost effective, reliable, and feasible. The act requires the Public
Utilities Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, to identify all potentially achievable
cost-effective electricity efficiency savings and to establish efficiency
targets for electrical corporations to achieve pursuant to their procurement
plan. The act requires the Public Utilities Commission, in consultation with the
State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, to identify all
potentially achievable cost-effective natural gas efficiency savings and to
establish efficiency targets for gas corporations to achieve and requires that a
gas corporation first meet its unmet resource needs through all available gas
efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost effective, reliable, and
feasible.

Existing law requires each local publicly owned electric utility, in procuring
energy, to first acquire all available energy efficiency and demand reduction
resources that are cost effective, reliable, and feasible. Existing law
additionally requires each local publicly owned electric utility to report
annually to its customers and to the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission, its investment in energy efficiency and demand reduction
programs, which report is to include a description of programs, expenditures,
and expected and actual energy savings results. Existing law requires a local
publicly owned electric utility to be responsible for implementing an energy
efficiency program that recognizes the Legislature's intent to encourage energy
savings and greenhouse gas emission reductions in existing residential and
nonresidential buildings, and to include in the above-described report, its
status in implementing the program.

The existing Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Act establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission. Existing law requires the Energy Commission, on or before November
1, 2007, and every 3 years thereafter, in consultation with the Public Utilities
Commission and local publicly owned electric utilities, in a public process that
allows input from other stakeholders, to develop a statewide estimate of all
potentially achievable cost-effective electricity and natural gas efficiency
savings and establish statewide annual targets for energy efficiency savings and
demand reduction over 10 years.

This bill would enact the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard Act. The Public
Utilities Commission, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, would be responsible for supervising
the implementation of the act by electrical corporations and gas corporations.
The governing board of each local publicly owned electric utility and local
publicly owned gas utility, in consultation with the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission, would be responsible for the
implementation of the act by the utility. The bill would require the State
Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, in a public
stakeholder engagement process, to determine how the energy savings goals of the
act are measured and reported. The act would require each electric utility and
gas utility, as defined, to establish an energy efficiency resource standard
that shall increase the amount of energy efficiency resources of the utility so
that the total amount of incremental energy savings achieved in any given year
amounts to not less than specified amounts. The bill would require the Public
Utilities Commission to require that Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern
California Edison Company, and San Diego Gas and Electric Company jointly
achieve a reduction in nonemergency, event-based demand response of 7% by 2020
and 10% by 2025, as measured by the sum of their peak demands. The bill would
require that not less than 25% of the energy savings of an electric utility or
gas utility come from disadvantaged communities identified by the California
Environmental Protection Agency, as specified. The bill would require each
electric utility and gas utility to annually file with the State Energy
Resources Conservation and Development Commission, a report that analyses the
energy savings achieved by the utility during the prior year, divided by the
energy consumption in the immediately preceding year.

Under existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand,
or requirement of the commission is a crime.

Because a violation of an order or decision of the commission implementing the
bill's requirements with respect to an electrical corporation or gas corporation
would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program by
creating a new crime. By placing additional requirements upon local publicly
owned electric and gas utilities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local
program.

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and
school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions
establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for
specified reasons.

Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local
program: yes.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:
P3    1
SECTION 1.

Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 8400) is

SOUR GAS LEAK PROBED

BYLINE: DAVE POMMER

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 438 words


Community activist criticizes effectiveness of evacuation plan

Staff of the Energy Resources Conservation Board will meet today with owners of
an oil well near Chestermere that seeped poisonous sour gas briefly Saturday
night.

They will try to determine what occurred at the well, located near 132nd St. and
50th Ave. S.E. and owned by Atlantic Energy Ltd., Energy Resources Conservation
Board senior inspector Pat Smith said Sunday.

Residents of Chestermere were put on evacuation notice for a short time. But the
well, southwest of Chestermere, shut down and the vapors disappeared, he said.

City police and Strathmore RCMP were involved and rerouted traffic. Nobody was
injured, although at least one Mountie felt nauseous.

Proper emergency procedures involving police and community organizations were
followed, Smith said.

The ERCB will review response to the leak. "Our primary concern is for the
public's safety," said Smith.

But a representative of one northeast Calgary community is concerned about what
sort of signals the response to the leak sends to residents in that area.

There are dozens of natural gas and oil wells containing dangerous hydrogen
sulphide east of Calgary, as well as kilometres of pipelines.

Anil Giga, Coral Springs community spokesman and longtime sour gas activist, is
worried about the confusing message for his neighbors in the response to
Saturday evening's mishap.

"In Chestermere, they were about to evacuate. In the event of an accident here,
what do we do?" he asked, adding that he doesn't think evacuation is a viable
strategy in the heavily-populated northeast areas of the city close to existing
or proposed wells.

The road network in northeast communities and density of population make rapid
evacuation "impossible" there, he said. "Resident safety is compromised in the
northeast."

Giga and others have been pushing the ERCB for years to boost the distances
wells are set back from residential areas.

Existing setbacks range from 100 metres to two kilometres, depending on well
flow rate, sour gas concentration and numerous other factors.

Giga has said he would like setbacks of at least 2.2 kilometres.

He said the ERCB continues to review the matter and is dragging its heels on an
important issue.

But the ERCB's Smith said there's an established evacuation procedure for all
areas near wells that produce sour gas, including those in northeast Calgary.

Operators must have "very thorough plans" in populated areas that include
evacuation plus the installation of equipment that automatically shuts down the
well, he said.

A hearing on a proposal to import hazardous wastes into Alberta for treatment
will come to Calgary May 26 and 27.

The Natural Resources Conservation Board hearing will start today in Swan Hills,
where the hazardous waste treatment plant is located.

Tata Power Celebrates Earth Day With A Difference

LENGTH: 463  words


Friday, April 19, 2013: In line with its efforts on curtailing wastage of energy
and spreading awareness about energy and resource conservation, Club Enerji-Tata
Power's national initiative on resource conservation has launched three distinct
online campaigns celebrating Earth Day on 22nd April, 2013. The aim is to
educate public at large and also showcase their efforts on conservation.

Club Enerji has created a special web tab on www.clubenerji.com to motivate its
followers to make online pledges in honour of Earth Day and spread the message
of saving the planet.

In another brand new initiative, Club Enerji has requested its followers to
share photos, videos or stories @TPenergyclub to showcase their efforts in their
day-to-day life, whether at home, school, college or office. Followers can also
send in tweets using #LightingUpLives.

Club Enerji followers also have the opportunity to participate in Pictionary
with a Twist by guessing the context of photos related to various environmental
issues and win green prizes.

Commenting on the initiative, Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power
said, "We welcome everyone to participate in these online campaigns and share
their efforts and ideas with us. Through these initiatives, we are committed to
providing the right platform to these young minds as well as the society to
discuss the significance of resource conservation. Club Enerji has played a
vital role in encouraging school students, who have been the core influencers in
advocating energy and resource conservation. The rationale behind engaging
through Club Enerji's online campaign is to make everyone aware of the need to
conserve and use energy responsibly."

Club Enerji is Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation movement, launched in
2007 with the view to spark off an initiative for curbing energy-wastage through
active measures, as well as propagating the significance of this mission amongst
fellow citizens.

As of date, Club Enerji has reached out to more than 400 schools across India,
sensitised more than 3.7 million citizens and saved more than 6.2 million units
of electricity. This saving is equivalent to saving 6200 tonnes of CO2 and is
enough to light up approximately 2900 houses for a year. Club Enerji has been
awarded Gold at the ABCI awards in the category Best Communication material and
Bronze for its Resource Conservation Module. It has been shortlisted as BEST
PRAX for presentation at International forum in Auckland in December. Asia
Pacific Enterprise Leadership Awards (APELA), Singapore, has conferred 'APELA
2012' - Eco Advocate Award' to Club Enerji. It has been recognized in the "2012
International Business Awards" with Gold Stevie Award for being the best
Marketing Campaign of the Year 2012 - Energy category.

ISMI Energy Study Reveals Significant Opportunities to Reduce Consumption,
Emissions and Costs in Semiconductor Manufacturing

LENGTH: 598  words


New Delhi, June 4 -- The International SEMATECH Manufacturing Initiative (ISMI)
has conducted and released its latest Worldwide Fab Energy Study which provides
benchmark data to help identify the areas to reduce energy use and improve
efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing operations. The study, conducted at
300 mm and 200 mm semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Asia, North America,
and Europe, shows a dramatic decline in normalized fab energy consumption from
1997 to 2011.

Researchers from ISMI's Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) Center evaluated
the annual energy use of each participating fab and determined that energy
consumed by process equipment, which according to the latest survey accounts for
more than 50 percent of a facility's energy usage, has improved its efficiencies
by half in 2011 and non-process equipment energy consumption has become
one-fourth of the 1997 values. The next highest energy consumers, after process
equipment, were central chiller plants and bulk gas production. Waste heat
recovery and reuse practices were benchmarked for best in class performance.

Recently ISMI initiated a workshop to collaborate with member company subject
matter experts to explore solutions for bulk gas production energy reduction.
The participants benchmarked best in class metrics and reviewed best in class
design practices for nitrogen plants, specifically focusing on air compressors,
which consume up to 85 percent of the bulk gas energy budget.

"Energy efficiency and conservation initiatives are critical to continue to
reduce energy consumption and integrate newer technology in semiconductor
manufacturing," said Sanjay Rajguru, director of ISMI. "ISMI's recent energy
study gives an overview of general industry performance and provides direction
for future ISMI energy use reduction activities. Through this and past studies
and the continuation of collaborating with industry peers and equipment
suppliers long-lasting energy efficiency achievements can be made possible."

Energy reduction has been part of ESH efforts at ISMI and SEMATECH since 1997,
when the program published the industry's first Worldwide Fab Energy Study.
Since then, ISMI technologists have worked extensively on projects focused on
resource conservation and manufacturing sustainability that collectively
document energy and resource conservation solutions. These reports, available to
members, include:

* Enabling and using the "idle" mode in vacuum pumps

* Optimizing exhaust flows on tools

* Lowering cleanroom airflow through HEPA filters

* Measuring key tools to optimize heat removal

Based on the energy survey results, ISMI will focus its efforts to further
enable effective energy savings in four identified areas: nitrogen system
efficiency and total consumption reduction, Controlled Dry Air (CDA) system
efficiency and total consumption reduction, process cooling water system
efficiency, and process vacuum system efficiency.

ISMI's ESH Center is dedicated to addressing the energy and resource
conservation needs of the semiconductor industry. Now that energy consumption
for the semiconductor industry has been reduced by half, ISMI will work to
reduce water and chemical usage to improve cost and reduce environmental impact.
To help drive the move towards more efficient operations, the ESH Center is
focusing on global regulatory challenges, emerging approaches for resource
conservation in existing and next generation manufacturing facilities, and
unique ESH requirements and solutions for the next generation of semiconductor
manufacturing processes and facilities.

Kowalski appointment near scandalous

BYLINE: GEORGE GOVIER, SPECIAL TO THE HERALD

SECTION: EDITORIAL; GUEST COLUMN; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 581 words


George Govier was chairman of the Energy Resources Conservation Board from 1962
to 1978.

Former deputy premier Ken Kowalski's appointment as chairman of the
soon-to-be-combined Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) and Public
Utilities Board (PUB) breaks a tradition of well over 40 years in which
appointees were selected on the basis of their professional knowledge of the
industry and their independence from both industry and politics.

I fault the government on four scores:

* the combination of the ERCB and the PUB;

* the unfortunate choice of name for the combined board;

* The inexcusably long delay in naming a successor to ERCB chairman Gerry De
Sorcy who retired in February of 1993;

* the appointment of a politician as chairman of a board, which won its
worldwide reputation on the basis of technical competence and independence from
political interference.

The combination of the two boards, presumably in the interests of economy and
the avoidance of conflict, reflects a lack of understanding of the roles of the
two agencies, the disciplines involved and the alternative solutions to the need
for coordination between them.

The ERCB has dealt with the assessment of Alberta's energy resources, has
regulated their development and has endeavored to see that this development took
place efficiently.

The Utilities Board deals with the charge which companies falling under its
jurisdiction may levy on the public for their services.

Granted, there is a relationship between the functions as they apply to the
generation and distribution of electricity, and that problems in this regard
have arisen, but cooperation would have been a better solution than combination.

The proposed new name, Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, disregards the
importance both legally and in a descriptive sense of "conservation."

Conservation has been the main reason for the existence since 1938 of the
Petroleum and Natural Gas (oil and gas) Conservation Board, renamed the Energy
Resources Conservation Board when the board was asked to assume responsibilities
related to coal and electrical energy.

It also does not properly reflect the relative size and scope of the two
organizations, with the duties of the ERCB requiring a staff nine or ten times
that of the Utilities Board.

The delay of over 18 months from the retirement of the last chairman to the
appointment of his successor is totally unnecessary and could not help but have
had a bad effect on the morale of ERCB board members and staff as well as the
members and staff of the PUB.

Finally, the appointment of a politician to the chairmanship of the combined
boards, however well qualified Kowalski might have been for his former duties,
is little short of scandalous.

It disregards the tradition of technical competence and political independence
of the board, it overlooks the well-qualified internal candidates, and, I
believe, it will result in the loss of many highly qualified and experienced
members and staff of the ERCB who see the stature of the board diminished and
the opportunities for their professional growth and advancement seriously
reduced.

The people of Alberta and the oil and gas, coal, and electrical industries have
benefited from the board's competent and impartial regulation of the province's
energy resources. The government itself has shared in the board's worldwide
reputation.

All stand to lose from the government's most recent action.

Alberta oil production jumps in '93

BYLINE: Laurie Ward

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 255 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


A surge in drilling activity in 1993 and the use of new technology by the
oilpatch triggered a solid increase in Alberta's oil production, says a study
published yesterday by the province.

Production rose to 935,000 barrels a day last year from 914,000 b/d in 1992.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board concludes that conventional oil
production in the province will continue to grow steadily for the next two
years, surpassing previous forecasts.

It predicts production will peak in 1995 at about 960,000 b/d. The ERCB
previously estimated production in the mid-1990s would be about 811,000 b/d.

In its most recent study, entitled Alberta Oil Supply 1994-2005, the province
attributed the production gains to an overall resurgence in the energy sector
and a vigorous application of horizontal drilling technology.

Dramatic growth in the natural gas industry - as a result of higher prices and
increased pipeline capacity - will result in sharp growth in the production of
pentanes plus, a liquid associated with natural gas.

The province predicts pentanes plus production will peak at about 190,000
barrels a day by the end of the decade, a 30% increase over previous estimates.

But plunging oil prices, now hovering around US$15 a barrel, will inhibit
investment in the production of bitumen from oilsands projects, resulting in
slower growth than previously expected.

It said companies will only proceed with projects to produce bitumen when
satisfied that oil prices have increased.

Alberta gas, chemical firms face off

BYLINE: Eric Reguly

SECTION: SECTION 1; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 834 words


  The fate of Alberta's growing petrochemical industry rests on the outcome of
one of the province's most exhaustive inquiries into energy policy, which winds
up this week in Calgary.

For almost two months, the provincial government's Energy Resources Conservation
Board (ERCB) has been delving into the complex issue of whether natural gas or
petrochemical producers have the greater proprietary claim to an increasingly
valuable gas byproduct called ethane. The public inquiry has collected 4,000
pages of transcripts from 31 companies and interest groups.

Ethane - the lifeblood of Alberta's $4-billion petrochemical industry - is used
to make ethylene, the prime component of vinyl-based compounds that go into
hundreds of plastic and rubber products.

The petrochemical industry, led by Calgary-based Nova Corp. and subsidiaries
Novacor Chemicals Ltd. and Alberta Gas Ethylene Co. (AGE), currently enjoy a
secure, steady and cheap supply of ethane. They buy ethane from the operators of
Alberta's straddle plants - so-called because they ''straddle'' the main gas
pipelines leaving the province. The plants remove the ethane from the gas
stream, a process called ''stripping.'' They ship the ethane to AGE's two plants
near Red Deer, where it's processed into ethylene. AGE plans to build a third
plant.

The ERCB hearings were prompted by gas producers' demand to keep more ethane for
themselves. In 1982, the ERCB gave approval to three producers - Canadian Hunter
Exploration Ltd., Sulpetro Ltd., and Chevron Standard Ltd. - to extract ethane
from the gas they produce before it's sent to the straddle plants.

The gas producers argue that since they own the gas, they own its components
too. ''If we have to forgo that (ethane stream), it's a rate of return we have
to forgo as well,'' says Jim Gray, vice-president of Canadian Hunter.

FINITE RESOURCE

Ethane is a finite resource - only a few gas fields in Alberta are rich in it.
The petrochemical producers fear that as gas companies expand their ethane
extraction operations, straddle plants will be left short. Less ethane supply
means higher straddle-plant operating costs. Ethane shortages at the straddle
plants may force the petrochemical industry to buy its raw material from gas
producers at much higher costs.

''If our industry is to be viable, we must be able to buy our ethane from the
straddle plants,'' says John Feick, president of Novacor Chemicals. ''We don't
want to pay additional field extraction costs.'' Petrochemical producers
estimate the gas producers' extraction plants already rob straddle plants of
about $25 million a year worth of ethane.

Feick's position is backed by AGE's ethylene customers, such as Dow Chemical
Canada Inc., Union Carbide Canada Ltd., C-I-L Inc. and Celanese Canada Inc.

Bill McCagherty, Dow's vice-president of hydrocarbons, says buying ethane from
gas producers instead of straddle plant operators would add about 50% to the
cost of ethane. ''It could threaten the long-term viability of the petrochemical
industry in Alberta.'' (Dow, with a plant outside Edmonton, is the single
biggest user of ethylene in the province.)

The Alberta government, which encouraged the development of a petrochemical
industry in the 1970s with the promise of a cheap and steady supply of ethane,
has proposed a solution: The petrochemical industry would be guaranteed a
minimum amount of ethane from the straddle plants, leaving the rest for the gas
producers to market as they please. If the minimum amount, or ''threshold''
level, is not met, the ERCB would require gas producers to make it up by
injecting ethane back into the gas stream.

The government has suggested that the ERCB set the threshold based on
information from the current hearings. ''It's going to be a difficult
decision,'' ERCB spokesman Brad Hubbard says. ''Both sides are far apart.''

Petrochemical producers claim they need 135,000 barrels a day (b/d) of ethane
now, increasing to 150,000 b/d in a few years when AGE's third Red Deer plant is
completed. The straddle plants extracted about 115,000 b/d in 1986.

The gas producers are willing to guarantee only 75,000 b/d - namely, the
capacity of the two existing AGE plants.

No one is guessing yet where the threshold will be set. Hubbard says the ERCB
report will be released early in 1988. Until a final figure is reached, the
board is holding up several applications from gas producers to build field
extraction plants.

Gas producers' most valuable market for ethane is enhanced oil recovery (EOR),
the science of squeezing the last barrels of oil from aging fields. The process
involves injecting ethane into the reservoir to swish loose the remaining crude
oil.

With both petrochemical and EOR demand for ethane climbing (the ERCB says EOR
will peak in 1992), tensions between the protagonists are bound to rise. ''We've
now come to the crunch point,'' says Ian Brownlie, a vice-president at Celanese
Canada.

Tata Power's Club Enerji Programme Commits to Nation Building; Focuses on
Creating Children as Responsible Citizens with Conservation of National
Resources, Conservation of Values

LENGTH: 761  words


May 4 -- Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide movement, announced today that the
Company is strengthening its programme by committing towards nation building.
The programme aims to do this by broadening the horizons and introducing various
critical facets that will widen the scope of the existing module and make it
expansive (deeper penetration in India and internationally). It is looking to
contribute towards nation building by creating responsible citizens who will
focus not only on conserving energy and natural resources (like fossil
fuel-coal, oil, gas, water, managing waste, afforestation) but also imbibe civic
and moral values. This year Club Enerji is also undertaking this unique
initiative of urging children to pledge to become better citizens.

In a nutshell the approach has been broadbased to:

Energy and National Resource Conservation + Conservation of Moral & Civic values
= Nation Building through responsible citizens

Over the years, Tata Power Club Enerji programme has been relentlessly working
towards spreading the message of judicious use and conservation of energy across
the country. Through its continuous efforts, Club Enerji has reached a momentous
milestone by successfully saving 14.2 MUs of electricity and sensitizing 9.3
million citizens across the country and now it plans to take it to the next
level of Nation building. This will be done through its efforts towards energy &
resource conservation including conservation of fossils fuels (coal, oil, gas) &
other natural resources and protecting the forest cover & biodiversity and moral
and civic values like encouraging students to be the change they want to see,
staying away from bad habits, being safe and ensuring others' safety, imbibing
honesty & good manners and having no gender bias. This year, Club Enerji will
also be looking at forging various partnerships to widen the reach and
penetration of the programme.

Speaking on the initiative, Mr. Anil Sardana, MD & CEO, Tata Power, said, "As
part of our 100 year celebration, we are determined to strengthen our programme
and encourage children of today to become Responsible Citizens of tomorrow. The
aim of the programme is to have children realise their future role as nation
builders by becoming good civic citizens, while working towards good practices
for conservation of energy and national resources and above all learn to
conserve Moral Values."

"Saving close to 14.2 MUs of electricity till date is a significant milestone
with our focused approach on spreading the message of energy conservation across
the country. We are thankful to all the students and mentors at schools for
supporting us in our efforts to help save our planet. We are determined to
continue with our programme and sensitise the citizens of tomorrow the dire need
of being moral & value based in growing as responsible citizens and promoting
energy & resource conservation. At Tata Power, we are committed to
lighting-up-lives for the years to come", Mr. Sardana further added.

The Club Enerji initiative has been contributing extensively towards a brighter
and greener tomorrow by undertaking several successful initiatives. The savings
of 14.2 MUs of electricity is equivalent to saving 14,200 tonnes of CO2 and is
enough to light up over 6,943 houses for a year. The initiative has further
sensitized approximately 9.3 million citizens cross 11 locations in Mumbai,
Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Lonavala, Maithon, Belgaum,
Jamshedpur and Ranchi.

Today, Club Enerji has become a holistic movement to save energy and natural
resources. It has reached out to over 480 schools in India with a total of
1,59,103 Energy Champions, and 2,04,719 Energy Ambassadors. Club Enerji also
encourages students to form their own mini clubs in their schools and societies
to reach out to more citizens. In 2014 alone, 1250 mini clubs were formed across
the country. Members of the mini Clubs regularly undertake rallies, street
plays, cyclothons, exhibitions and batti bandhs to sensitise as many people as
possible on energy conservation.

Tata Power's Club Enerji has won numerous accolades and has been recognized as a
best practice in forums like Learning Mission by the Tata Group. A case study
has also been done by IIM Ahmedabad on the programme. Further it has also won
the Gold at the ABCI awards in the category 'Best Communication Material' and
Bronze for its Resource Conservation Module; Asia Pacific Enterprise Leadership
Awards (APELA), Singapore, has conferred 'APELA 2012' - Eco Advocate Award' to
Club Enerji.

Megaproject threatened, Nova says

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 234 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  A long-awaited ruling by Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board casts
doubt on whether Nova Corp. will proceed with a $2-billion petrochemicals
megaproject.

Last week, Nova Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Blair announced plans to build
a $500-million ethylene plant and a string of plastics plants at Joffre, Alta.,
where the company already operates two ethylene plants. But Nova and a
consortium of U.S. and Asian investors would only go ahead with the development
if the province guaranteed a steady supply of ethane gas at an ''acceptable''
price, he warned.

The ERCB does not appear to have been swayed by Blair's warning. After months of
deliberation, it has recommended that only existing petrochemical plants be
guaranteed a low-priced supply of ethane. Otherwise, it urges Alberta to
establish an open market.

Under provincial laws passed last August, Nova - Alberta's only ethylene
manufacturer - pays the lowest price possible for ethane: natural gas price plus
extraction cost.

Gas producers, who want to extract and market ethane themselves, say the fair
market value for ethane is considerably higher.

While producers are happy with the recommendations, they are apprehensive about
the government's response. Premier Don Getty, who has already held up release of
the ERCB report, has said he needs further time to decide whether to implement
it.

Alberta energy revenue low despite record sales in '88

BYLINE: Canadian Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 269 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  The Alberta energy industry last year chalked up its lowest gross revenues
since 1980 despite record increases in production and sales.

Revenues from energy sales totaled an estimated $16.4 billion in 1988, a
decrease of 5% from the previous year, the provincial Energy Resources
Conservation Board reported in its annual review this week.

Despite a surge in crude oil production, low prices, exacerbated by the strong
C$, caused crude oil and equivalent revenues to drop by $1 billion to $9.9
billion.

And while 1988 saw record marketable natural gas sales, revenues increased by
only 5% to $4.4 billion, held down by lower gas prices.

Sulphur revenues were up 4% to more than $600 million, despite lower sulphur
prices. Sulphur revenues hit a four-year high.

Revenues for coal were up marginally to about $430 million, as coal prices
firmed and sales expanded, particularly to offshore markets.

While conventional oil production held its own in 1988 at about 57.5 million
cubic metres, bitumen and synthetic crude oil production reached a record of
more than 19 million cubic metres.

Thus, total crude oil and equivalent sales registered their highest level of the
last decade at 83.5 million cubic metres.

The board attributed this, in large part, to the first full year of operation
with the expanded Interprovincial Pipe Line system and the Modified Proration
Plan, which contributed to easier access to markets.

But ongoing capacity problems suggest that increases in supply in the future
will likely require some expansion of extraprovincial trunk lines.

Dow's plan stirs up ethane fray

BYLINE: Johanna Powell

SECTION: SECTION 1; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 427 words

DATELINE: Edmonton,Alta.


  Dow Chemical Canada Ltd. has stepped into the fray over Alberta's ethane
feedstocks by announcing it wants to proceed with an $800-million ethylene plant
near Edmonton.

A fierce battle over the feedstocks is already raging between Nova Corp., which
has had an effective monopoly over most feedstocks in the province, and about
600 gas producers, who want the market opened up.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board has recommended gas producers be allowed
to remove the ethane - the raw material used to form ethylene, used in turn as
building block for plastics - from natural gas at the source wells. Currently,
the feedstocks are removed by Nova at extraction plants at the junctions of
provincial pipelines.

The Alberta government still has not released its ruling. But Energy Minister
Neil Webber told reporters in Calgary Friday that the province wants new
petrochemical projects to proceed under ''as close to free-market conditions''
as possible. That would indicate the province is likely to go along with the
ERCB recommendation, effectively ending Nova's monopoly.

Bill McCagherty, Dow's vice-president of hydrocarbons, says Nova and the gas
producers have taken opposing positions and ''our position is somewhere between
the two, but closer to the producers.''

Nova has said that if the Alberta government opens up the feedstock market, it
will not proceed with a proposed string of ethylene and plastics plants
announced for Joffre, south of Edmonton.

''We don't need those kinds of guarantees to proceed with our ethylene plant,''
McCagherty says.

McCagherty says Dow is not trying to pressure the provincial government by
releasing plans for its plant before a decision has been announced. ''I don't
think the government could be pressured.''

He points out that some feedstocks are already being removed and used for
miscible flooding of oil wells, a technique for extracting hard-to-recover oil.

The reservoirs suitable for flooding will be exhausted about the same time the
Dow ethylene plant is scheduled to come on-stream in 1993, he says.

McCagherty also says plans call for a new ethylene plant in Fort Saskatchewan,
just north of Edmonton, and expansion of existing facilities to produce
byproducts such as polyethylene and glycols, a key ingredient in anti-freeze.

Dow said Friday it will proceed with the engineering stage of the proposed
plant. Final approval will be made sometime next year. The project would provide
1,500 construction jobs and create 350 to 400 permanent jobs.

DESORCY ASKED TO TAKE PART IN REVIEW

Gerry DeSorcy, who recently retired as chairman of Alberta's Energy Resources
Conservation Board, has been appointed chairman of an advisory panel set up to
review federal regulation of the oil, gas, pipeline, electricity and atomic
power industries.

In announcing the appointment Wednesday, federal Energy Minister Bill McKnight
said the group will subject Ottawa's regulations to a "competitiveness test," to
cut interference with industry to a minimum essential to protect public
interests.

The panel will supervise regulation reviews by officials of Energy, Mines and
Resources Canada, the National Energy Board and the Atomic Energy Control Board.
McKnight's plan calls for a report and recommendations by the end of June.

Other Albertans appointed to the eight-member supervisory panel include Giacomo
Capobianco, former president of the Coal Association of Canada and Gerard
Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

SECTION: D:NON PROFIT

LENGTH: 926 words


Our Mission:

To empower our community to conserve natural resources.

We Serve:

A thriving community that understands the finite nature of natural resources and
acts to conserve them.

Brief History:

The Center for ReSource Conservation (CRC), formerly the Boulder Energy
Conservation Center (BECC), was founded in 1976 by a group of community-minded
citizens seeking ways to help reduce our dependence on non-renewable resources.
The organization has since developed extensive expertise in the areas of
residential green building, renewable energy, energy efficiency, waste
reduction, and water conservation. The environmental nonprofit shares practical
solutions for environmental living through print and online communications
materials, direct services, events, workshops, one-on-one conservation
counseling, demonstration projects, tours, and walk-in/e-mail/phone requests for
information. CRC's goal is to tackle resource conservation issues close to home,
provide accessible and affordable conservation solutions, and reduce the
negative environmental impacts associated with non-sustainable norms and habits.
The CRC's objective is to provide programs and services that empower individuals
to turn natural resource conservation beliefs into action in their daily lives.

Proudest Accomplishment:

Each year, the CRC empowers more than 30,000 individuals to live a more
sustainable life. The CRC reaches out to and engages these individuals through
programming in its energy, water, and waste/deconstruction divisions:

The CRC's Energy Division inspires action that advances energy efficiency,
renewable energy, and energy conservation technologies and approaches. The
energy division operates the energy and green building hotline, provides
information on insulation and solar thermal rebates available, provides
residential energy action counseling, and hosts educational seminars,
conferences, and tours, including the annual Boulder County Tour of Solar and
Green Built Homes. During 2008, the residential energy audit program alone will
prevent approximately 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases from entering the
atmosphere.

The CRC's Water Division develops and implements educational programs and
services that help residents increase outdoor water use efficiency, adhere to
best management practices, and reach water conservation goals. The water
division offers educational seminars on irrigation systems and xeric gardens,

provides free sprinkler system inspections through its Slow the Flow program,
and sells professionally designed, low cost xeric gardens to the public through
its popular Garden-In-A-Box and Trees Across Boulder programs. Each year, the
xeric garden program helps to convert 40,000 square feet of high-water-use
landscape to xeriscape.

The CRC's Waste Division, ReSource, promotes waste reduction through innovative
landfill diversion programs. ReSource retail locations in Boulder and Fort
Collins along with the ReSource Deconstruction Program salvage used building
materials and resell them to the public ($700,000 in revenues annually), making
it possible to reuse and recycle 2 million pounds of materials annually that
would otherwise have been discarded during construction and demolition and basic
remodeling projects.

Greatest Need:

To continue the work of empowering Boulder County residents the CRC relies on
the generosity of community members through contributions and volunteer efforts.
With a significant increase in demand for the nonprofit's practical and cost
savings-oriented programs, the CRC aims this year to increase by 50 percent the
amount of support the CRC receives from individuals within our community to meet
the demand. By contributing your time or financial support to the CRC you will
play an important role in leading our community toward a more sustainable
future.

Future Plans:

2009 CRC Program Goals:

ReSource will divert more than 2.35 million pounds of reusable building
materials from landfills, thus reducing CO2 emissions by about 300,000 pounds.

Slow The Flow will conduct ap

proximately 1,250 free residential and light commercial sprinkler system
inspections, resulting in up to a 40 percent reduction in outdoor water use for
each of the properties inspected.

Insulate Colorado, a rebate program aimed to incentivize homeowners to make
energy efficiency improvements to their existing homes, will build on its
success in 2008.

The Solar Thermal Rebate Program will continue to offer rebates to allow
homeowners and businesses to affordably harness Colorado's abundant solar
resources.

REAP will grow from an audit program into an energy action program to assist
each REAP participant to action through energy counseling by helping residents
to understand the energy audit reports outcomes, identify efficiency measures
the homeowner owner wants to install, provide for general consultation on
rebates and contractors available per measure and assist with bulking measures
for financing under the new ClimateSmart Loan Program.

ReNew Our Schools will install photovoltaic systems at three Boulder County
Schools and work with teachers to help them educate students about energy
efficiency and renewable energy.

Garden-In-A-Box will facilitate the conversion of 40,000 square feet of
high-water-use landscape to xeriscape gardens.

Regulation may become oilpatch task

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 346 words


Petroleum regulation in Alberta is due for a radical shift to the hands of oil
companies as provincial government watchdogs struggle to cut costs, says a
member of the Energy Resources Conservation Board.

"Industry is going to have to be much more responsible for meeting regulatory
requirements," Brian Bietz told a conference of environmental companies
Wednesday in Calgary.

Requirements for filing reports will be cut and individual companies will have
to police themselves, Bietz said.

"However, the onus will be on the company to keep high-quality records," he
said.

If provincial inspectors do find violations, companies will face tougher
penalties and more inspections of other company facilities, said Bietz.

He said the ERCB will have to cut its budget another 18 per cent in the next two
years, from about $ 38 million to $ 32 million, to meet government spending
targets. Government and industry each contribute about half of the money in the
board's annual budget.

Between 1986 and 1996, the board's size will fall by 40 per cent, but it comes
at a time when record numbers of oil and gas wells are being drilled in Western
Canada.

The upcoming merger of the ERCB and the Public Utilities Board will make no
difference to these demands, which are forcing the regulators to find new ways
to keep track of Alberta's petroleum and coal resources.

Bietz also warned producers that there's a growing list of expired oil and gas
plants that will have to be cleaned up.

Of the 660 natural gas plants in Alberta, 68 are no longer running. But only two
of them have been dismantled, had their land decontaminated and the soil
reclaimed to meet Alberta Environment standards.

In the rush to keep up with production demands, companies have preferred to
spend their cash upgrading the environmental standards on operating facilities.

However, Bietz said the industry will soon have to look at cleaning up plants
that have no further use.

"The board now intends to take a much more active approach on decommissioning"
closed petroleum plants.

OPINIONS WANTED ON WASTE PLAN

BYLINE: ANTHONY JOHNSON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1/ FRONT

LENGTH: 355 words


ERCB will allow more input on oil industry scheme

Albertans will be given another chance to air their concerns over oil industry
proposals to pump hazardous wastes into the ground.

Energy Resources Conservation Board officials decided Wednesday to allow more
public input before ruling on guidelines for the deep disposal wells.

The move follows a Herald story Wednesday which reported the board was going to
go ahead with the plan without further public review, prompting criticism from
environmentalists in the province.

Rob Cox, of the ERCB, said the board felt it had given ample opportunity for
feedback from Albertans since November 1990. Invitations were extended to
interested parties to respond to a new waste classification system and improved
monitoring and surveillance of wells.

When invitations were declined, the board decided to proceed with proposals,
said Cox.

But media reports spawned a flurry of public concern, prompting a change of
heart by the ERCB.

"We now have an indication that there's a desire to have public input," said
Cox.

How input is going to be gathered is still in question. Environmentalists want
full public hearings by the federal National Resources Conservation Board on the
complex issue.

"If we can have an NRCB hearing on a tourism development, we should certainly
have one for something that has this type of significant environmental and
economic impact," says Brian Staszenski, executive director for the
Edmonton-based Environment-al Resource Centre.

Cox insists formal hearings aren't needed.

Environmentalists favor burning the waste at the Swan Hills incinerator, but the
cost can be up to 50 times that of injecting the waste into the deep wells.

Staszenski says a $ 60-million expansion of Swan Hills was approved with the
plan to handle more oilfield waste.

"If these wastes are not going to now be designated to Swan Hills . . . somebody
needs to do some number-crunching and come up with an analysis on what the
impact is going to be economically," said Staszenski.

"The economics are as important as the environmental (issues)."

Lessons of Whaleback still being learned

BYLINE: Laurie Ludwick

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTING; Pg. 18, Alberta Report

LENGTH: 677 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


As the shock subsides over Amoco Canada Ltd.'s failure to win approval for a
$1.2-billion natural gas project because of environmental concerns, Calgary's
oil patch is starting to ask itself what went wrong.

The decision by the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board that blocked the
project in the Whaleback area of the Eastern Slopes of the Rocky Mountains -
which are believed to contain elephantine natural-gas reserves - could have
profound implications for all oil and gas companies operating in Alberta's
sensitive wilderness areas.

Rigel Energy Corp., Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., and Home Oil Ltd. are all
working on energy projects in the Eastern Slopes. These projects could have
great financial potential if they receive the necessary environmental approvals.
If they do not receive approval, or if there are delays, it will be a major
setback for the firms involved.

There are some energy executives who see the ERCB decision as an isolated event
that will have little long-term impact. They point the finger at Amoco,
criticizing the Canadian unit of the U.S. energy giant for arrogance and
insensitivity when dealing with residents who lived near the Whaleback, a
pristine wilderness located about 120 kilometres south of Calgary.

''Amoco has only itself to blame,'' said one observer. ''They went in there
saying, 'this is what we're going to do and you're going to like it.' They were
adversarial right out of the chute.''

Some local residents I interviewed last May at the Energy Resources Conservation
Board hearing into the Whaleback development would agree with that assessment.
They were angered at what they called Amoco's unwillingness to listen - let
alone address - their concerns about the sour gas well that Amoco wanted to
drill.

In an interview last week, Phil Prince, the co-chairman of the ERCB, noted the
need for better communication among the public, the government and the energy
sector. He also said the industry could learn some lessons from Amoco's
rejection.

The Whaleback isn't the only issue of concern to the oil patch. This week,
environmental groups tried to adjourn a National Energy Board hearing into
natural gas exports to the U.S., saying the forum does not provide a fair
opportunity to debate environmental issues.

It's part of an attempt by Alberta environmentalists to try to force the federal
government to do comprehensive environmental assessment on the impact of oil and
gas exploration and development before approving more natural gas exports to the
U.S.

Last autumn, many energy executives were upset when Alberta's Eastern Slopes
were compared with Clayoquot Sound, the ancient British Columbia rain forest
that attracted international attention last summer in a battle between loggers
and environmentalists. Concern in Europe that B.C. companies were acting
irresponsibly prompted major European paper companies to cancel big contracts
with Canadian forestry companies.

Despite the magnitude of the issue - and the revenues at stake for the sector
and the Alberta government - there are signs that the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers, the organization that represents the interests of 190
Canadian energy companies, is sitting on the fence and not taking measures to
address the issue.

In an interview last week, CAPP president Gerry Protti refused to say what - if
anything - the industry could learn from the Amoco experience. He maintained
that development in sensitive areas is consistent with sustainable development.
And he would not comment on a new process to sell mineral rights that has been
established by the B.C. government, which attempts to prevent conflicts between
energy companies and environmental groups.

Industry insiders say CAPP's position is made difficult because of internal
divisions in the organization. Many energy executives are great outdoor
enthusiasts and believe some sensitive areas deserve protection.

Clearly, environmental issues will be a part of the Alberta oil-patch scene for
a while yet.

Alberta gas hearings could have wide effects

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  After months of acrimony over competing proposals for Alberta's stalled
Caroline sour gas project, Shell Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd. are set for a
showdown before the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board.

In hearings that start Tuesday in the small central Alberta community of
Caroline (just north of the two-trillion-cubic-foot gas and gas liquids field
that bears its name), the AERCB will adjudicate the heated battle between the
development consortium's two biggest stake-holders.

But the dispute, which has delayed the $800 million-to-$900 million megaproject
by at least two years, involves not just Shell and Husky. Also determined to
have their say are a host of environmental and community groups, other gas
producers with equity stakes in Caroline, and a small army of construction firms
and contractors eager for work on the project. While few of these are totally
opposed to development, most have pronounced views on which version of the
project is preferable.

The Caroline hearings also could have implications for Alberta's entire oil and
gas industry.

It's unusual for the province's respected energy watchdog to be asked to
arbitrate disputes between oil and gas producers. For obvious reasons, the AERCB
strives to avoid the appearance of favoring one corporate player over another.
Thus, it encourages the industry to settle its beefs in private.

However, some analysts suggest the board may use the opportunity to strengthen
its already considerable regulatory powers.

''The fear in the )energy( community is that the board is going to use this to
get a broader mandate,'' says oil and gas analyst Ian Doig, editor of industry
newsletter Doig's Digest. ''I think the industry's getting itself in a bind. The
competitive nature of the hearing gives the AERCB an opening to rule on things
that might not have been on the platter.''

In particular, since environmental arguments figure prominently in the Shell and
Husky proposals, the board could use the Caroline hearings to usher in stricter,
more comprehensive environmental standards for energy projects - a development
that could cost the oil and gas industry dearly.

Harold Keushnig of the AERCB's gas department says the board considers its
mandate for the Caroline hearings to be wide open. Its eventual ruling will take
into account environmental, safety and economic concerns, the probable social
impacts of the competing projects, their relative merits in terms of ''orderly
and efficient development,'' as well as concerns that fall in a catch-all
category labeled ''Alberta's best interests.''

The industry's alarm at the possible implications of such broad-based scrutiny
is probably a key reason 13 of the 15 Caroline partners, owning 27% of the
project among them, have lined up behind Shell, the project operator with a 61%
stake. Even Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., an 8.5% partner in Caroline, has said it
supports Shell, although the original version of Husky's proposal called for
some of the Caroline gas to be processed at a Gulf plant.

That leaves just Husky, with 12% of Caroline, marching to its own drum beat.

But Husky President Art Price vows nothing short of an AERCB ruling that Shell's
proposal is better than Husky's will convince him to fall in step with the rest
of the Caroline partners.

Shell is equally intransigent.

''Caroline will be developed. But if )our proposal( were not approved, it would
not be automatic for Husky's to be considered the next best alternative. We
would have to see what we could do with our project to make it acceptable to the
board,'' says Ray Woods, Shell's manager of gas development and chief Caroline
policy spokesman.

Despite considerable environmental posturing and public relations blitzes by
both protagonists, the nub of the Caroline dispute concerns corporate vested
interests.

Husky proposes to expand its existing Ram River gas processing and sulphur
recovery plant, situated in the spruce-clad hills west of Rocky Mountain House,
Alta., to handle the Caroline gas. Though he downplays this, Price is surely
considering his options for expanding and modernizing the 20-year-old plant -
for years the biggest gas plant in Alberta - to process gas from new discoveries
in the Rocky Mountain foothills. Shell argues that Husky would dearly love the
Caroline partners to subsidize such an expansion.

As project operator, Shell aims to keep control of the Caroline gas by building
a new processing plant to be operated by itself. Shell argues that the proper
place to process poisonous sour gas and sour gas liquids is as close to the gas
field as possible. (Husky plans to process liquids in the field, but would build
a 54-kilometre pipeline to transport the Caroline gas to Ram River.)


But Shell's proposed new plant would make it easier for the company to proceed
with another prized resources megaproject: production of up to $10 billion worth
of sulphur from the nearby Bearberry ultrasour gas field.

Unlike several other Caroline partners, Husky holds no stake in Bearberry. And
since Shell has not filed an application with the AERCB to develop Bearberry,
Price argues that the sulphur project is irrelevant to the Caroline debate. But
the AERCB seems less sure about this, and has asked Shell to provide information
on Bearberry at the Caroline hearings.

But whatever Husky's and Shell's true motives, it's certain that legitimate
environmental, safety and social concerns will surface at the hearings.

The hinge pin of Husky's campaign is its claim that expanding and upgrading the
Ram River plant will result in a net reduction in acid emissions, even though
more gas will be processed.

This is an argument that has won Husky the support of prominent Alberta
environmentalist Martha Kostuch. Known for doing her homework, Kostuch says
sulphur dioxide emissions in central Alberta will decrease by 27.8 metric tons a
day under Husky's plan, but will rise by 13.3 metric tons a day if the Shell
plant is built.

Shell counters that its project is the best environmental solution if Bearberry
is taken into account.

Quarterly sales up at Stop & Shop

QUINCY - Sales rose by 1.9 percent at Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. and its
Giant-Landover sister chain in the second quarter, compared with the same time a
year ago.

Royal Ahold, the Amsterdam-based parent company of both supermarket chains,
reported that the Quincy-based chains collected $3.9 billion in sales for the
quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year rose by 1.1 percent at Stop &
Shop, and fell by 1 percent at Giant-Landover.

Royal Ahold also announced that it would delist its shares from the New York
Stock Exchange. The Dutch company's American Depository Receipts will continue
to be traded on the over-the-counter market in the United States.

Medical device firm merges operations

BURLINGTON - ConforMIS, a medical device company that focuses on orthopedic
implants, has consolidated its operations in a new, 15,000-square-foot
headquarters in Burlington. The company currently employs about 30 people but
expects to grow extensively throughout the next few years. The new headquarters
replaces operations that had been located in Lexington, and Foster City, Calif.

Program will give farmers incentives to save energy

BOSTON - The state's Energy and Environmental Affairs office unveiled a program
that will provide Bay State farmers with incentives for energy conservation and
renewable energy projects.

The new program, which is being funded through state and federal grants, will
start energy efficiency measures at 100 farms in Massachusetts initially. The
state Department of Agricultural Resources recently awarded $250,000 to
Berkshire-Pioneer Resource Conservation and Development Area Inc. of Amherst to
develop and implement the program.

Under the two-year program, the Berkshire-Pioneer Resource Conservation and
Development Area and the Westford-based Patriot Resource Conservation and
Development Area councils will help provide on-farm energy audits and renewable
energy assessments, and then work with farmers to implement energy efficiency
recommendations.

Chairperson should come from within energy board

SECTION: LETTER; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 225 words


Irreparable damage continues to be inflicted on the Energy Resources
Conservation Board and its dedicated staff whose responsibility it is to
administer the regulations.

Although it has received unstinting support from two former, well-respected
chairpersons, the board has had to put up -- in silence -- with uninformed
comments by those who really don't know any better.

We must not forget that the board has gained world-wide recognition for its high
level of regulatory expertise. This must be maintained so that Alberta's oil and
gas continue to be "conserved" in the best interests of we citizens, its owners.

I am one of the relatively few who have worked "both sides of the street." Based
on my extensive experience with both regulatory and industry aspects of the oil
patch, I sincerely believe there is only one answer to this problem: The energy
minister must, through an order-in-council, instruct the board to strike an
internal committee to choose a chairperson from among its ranks.

As this turmoil subsides, the board will also have learned its lesson and
realize that leadership is 100-per-cent essential. After it has made its choice,
with which I am sure the minister will be satisfied, it can put all this
industry and political interference behind it and get on with its duties.

AUBREY KERR,

Calgary.

Revenues rise by 10% in oilpatch

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 39, Western News

LENGTH: 214 words


Gross revenues earned by Alberta's energy industries increased 10% in 1993 to
$18.8 billion, the Alberta government reported yesterday.

Oil's share of revenues was 54%, while natural gas contributed a record 35% of
energy sales.

In its annual review, the Energy Resources Conservation Board reported total
1993 investment in Alberta's energy sector reached $3.5 billion, a 10% increase
over 1992 levels. Capital investment in oil and gas was an estimated $2.95
billion.

Crude oil production was an estimated 340 million barrels, a 2% increase over
1992. This production level is part of a sustained five-year pattern that few
forecasters thought possible, the review says.

The government attributes the near-record drilling and increased productivity to
the province's royalty holiday incentive program, stable oil prices and new
technologies, such as horizontal drilling and three-dimensional seismic.

More than 7,000 wells were completed in Alberta in 1993, almost doubling the
previous year's activity. The most dramatic increase was in natural gas
development wells, which jumped from 334 in 1992 to 1805 in 1993.

Natural gas production in Alberta hit record levels last year with an estimated
3.9 trillion cubic feet, an increase of 17% over 1992.

Oil-patch safety

BYLINE: Tom Neufeld, Energy Resources Conservation Board

SECTION: LETTER TO THE EDITOR; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 114 words

DATELINE: Calgary


Your editorial Stricter Penalties Needed (Sept. 12) may have left readers with
the impression that Alberta's energy industry is self-regulated; that the Energy
Resources Conservation Board lacks the resources to adequately monitor activity;
and that there are no penalties if the rules are broken. In fact, Alberta's
energy industry is tightly regulated, extensively monitored and has never been
safer. Alberta's 140 field inspectors conducted more than 16,000 inspections
last year, and shut down 247 facilities.

The past three years have seen the three highest oil-patch compliance rates with
major board regulations. And in 2007, Alberta's pipeline failure rate was a
record low.

Key restructuring moves to come

BYLINE: DONALD CAMPBELL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 506 words


The Alberta government may be ahead of the game in its goal of producing a
balanced budget, but key components of the Energy Department's restructuring
plans are moving slower than heavy oil in January.

Energy Minister Pat Black said Monday she was still unable to provide new
information on two major initiatives announced in February's provincial budget:

* There is no decision yet on who will be appointed chairperson and manage the
merger of the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Public Utilities
Board.

* The government continues to wrestle with what decision it should make about
marketing its royalty share of petroleum currently handled by a branch of
government known as the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission.

When asked what was happening with the search for a new chairperson of the
Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, the minister said: "It's still in process."
When asked when the process will be completed, she said: "When we're done."

The length of time taken to find a new chairperson has prompted wide
speculation.

Rumors have swirled for weeks that Sherrold Moore, a recently retired Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co. executive who is still working for the company as a
consultant, would get the nod. Aside from Moore's industry credentials, he has a
close relationship with Premier Ralph Klein and is a member of his personal
clique known as "the kitchen cabinet."

But the appointment of Moore poses potential complications for the government,
given that Amoco was an applicant for a controversial drilling licence in the
Whaleback region of the Eastern Slopes of the Rockies. Amoco's application was
recently denied, but as Black noted Monday "the door is still open" for another
try.

Meanwhile, industry sources said they are puzzled by the length of time it has
taken for the appointment and merger to take place. "I can't see any political
or practical justification for it to be held up," said one oil company
executive. Added an employee at the ERCB: "It's taken a surprising length of
time."

The decision on what new regime will replace the current APMC system to market
the province's share of all the oil produced in Alberta is also expected
imminently. But Black wouldn't tip her hand.

"One of the things that is very important is to make sure that it doesn't cost
us more to market the crude than it does with the APMC," she said.

An industry source familiar with the discussions said Monday the province has
ruled out getting one private company to take over APMC's role. It has also
ruled out allowing producers to set a self-determined price, then conducting
follow-up audits, the source said.

The province is determined to set up a formula where producers would divert the
province's royalty share of production to private marketers and send a cheque to
Edmonton about every 55 days, the source said. But the province and producers
disagree on how that price should be set.

The source said the government likely needs a new system to take effect by Jan.

Between a rock and a hard place

LENGTH: 995 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Reviewing megaprojects like northern Alberta's controversial $1.5-billion
Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Ltd. pulp mill can be a delicate and often
thankless task. It's the kind of job that Alberta's top regulatory expert, Gerry
DeSorcy, will soon be tackling regularly.

DeSorcy, until very recently chairman of Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation
Board, is the man the Alberta government picked to head its new Natural
Resources Conservation Board - the body charged with reviewing all major
proposals for projects in forestry, mining, water management, recreation and
tourism.

A golfer, hiker and rose gardener when time permits, DeSorcy has spent 36 years
working for the Energy Resources Board and pruning its procedures for reviewing
energy projects and regulating the energy industry's day-to-day affairs. Now
he's setting the ground rules for other resource industries too.

The task will be challenging, not just because of the size and economic
importance of the projects, but because the new agency itself is controversial.

The idea of forming the new board was spawned during last year's political
fracas over the Al-Pac proposal. In an effort to diversify Alberta's energy
-focused economy, Premier Don Getty was doing everything possible to attract
pulp and paper projects.

He had granted timber rights to tracts of northern forest covering an area
larger than Britain, and had agreed to subsidize more than $3 billion in new
forest industry developments, all without an environmental review or public
hearings.

But when the Al-Pac deal was announced as a fait accompli - signed behind closed
doors even though it involved roughly $400 million in provincial subsidies -
green-minded Albertans had had enough.

Matters came to a head when Environment Canada stepped in, claiming that Alberta
was breaking federal environmental laws.

Alberta Environment Minister Ralph Klein then accused Ottawa of using the Canada
Environmental Protection Act to exert control over Alberta's natural resources.
In the end, both governments agreed to compromise by setting up a
federal-provincial panel to review the Al-Pac proposal. DeSorcy was chosen to
chair the panel.


Soon afterward, the Alberta government announced its plan to form the Natural
Resources Conservation Board as an independent review body to operate at arm's
length from the government. It was clearly a move aimed at preventing further
federal ''interference'' with the province's management of its natural
resources. Predictably, it has left some federal officials fuming.


But if anyone can pour oil on troubled waters, it's Gerry DeSorcy.

''I thought he was a very fair and patient man - very non-confrontational. Given
his personality, I don't think he'll ruffle feathers,'' says John Carey, an
Environment Canada scientist who presented evidence at the Al-Pac hearing that
DeSorcy chaired.

DeSorcy is well-known in industry and government circles in Alberta, where he is
universally respected. Environmentalists know him, too, since environmental
concerns figured prominently in recent Energy Resources Board hearings on the
development of central Alberta's huge Caroline sour gas field. DeSorcy commands
respect from environmental lobbyists, even from some who say he works too
closely with industry.

''He would not have been my first choice (to head the new board) because he
doesn't have a pro-environmental background. But he's certainly a fair person,''
says Martha Kostuch, one of Alberta's most outspoken environmentalists.

Though the impetus for forming the new board came from public concern about the
environment, DeSorcy says the board will have to weigh the social and economic
effects of each project it reviews as well as its environmental impact. ''It's a
question of balancing those three main elements to determine if a project is in
the public interest,'' he explains.

DeSorcy says public involvement in the planning of new natural resources
projects is ''critical.'' However, he hopes to avoid having to use public
hearings to air disputes.

''Public hearings are an efficient way to make a decision, but not to resolve
diferences. There's often a potential for win-win situations, but hearings are
almost always, by definition, win-lose processes,'' he notes.

''One of the things I'm going to be striving for with the new board is a lot of
public involvement prior to hearings. These things have to be put out to the
public as soon as possible, so the proponents know well ahead of time what is
expected.''

Industry should benefit from this as well as the public, DeSorcy argues: Al-Pac
nearly had to shred its plans because it wasn't told early on what standards the
project would be expected to meet.

DeSorcy's views on the best ways to get industry and communities working
together are the fruit of a long career that started in an oil field in central
Alberta's Drayton Valley. After earning a degree in petroleum engineering from
the University of Alberta in 1955, DeSorcy went to work for the field office of
the Energy Resources Board's predecessor, the Petroleum and Natural Gas
Conservation Board.


''I lived in a trailer out at Drayton Valley, and had a great time,'' says
DeSorcy, who spent five years inspecting drilling equipment in various oil
fields around the province.

A coal miner's son who grew up in Newcastle, Alta., DeSorcy says he was
originally attracted to petroleum engineering because it seemed ''the manly
thing to do'' for a person with numerate, rather than literary, talents.

But regulating Alberta's emerging oil and gas industry quickly became a
life-long vocation. After working in almost all of the Energy Board's
departments, DeSorcy because a board member in 1974, vice-chairman in 1978, and
chairman in 1987.

Until now, nobody has pried DeSorcy away from the board, and he plans to return
to it after his 18-month stint with the new board.

Tata Power 'Club Enerji' saves close to 1.5 million units, sensitizes 1.24
million citizens across Mumbai

BYLINE: Chittaranjan Tembhekar

SECTION: MUMBAI

LENGTH: 453 words


MUMBAI: In line with its philosophy to curb wastage of energy and spread
awareness about energy conservation, Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy
and resource conservation movement spearheaded by school children, has gained
momentum across the nation.

In the year 2012-13, Tata Power Club Enerji sensitised around 12, 48,664
citizens and saved more than 14, 56,850 million units of energy in the city of
Mumbai alone, which can light up 682 houses. The units saved by the Club are
equivalent to saving around 1457 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Tata Power's
nationwide movement propagating energy and resource conservation had its
enthusiastic members pledge continuing commitment to the cause they have
embarked upon.

Due to the increasing demand for effective management and conservation of
resources, Tata Power, India's largest integrated power utility, started a
unique initiative of energy conservation through school children called "Tata
Power Club Enerji" in 2007.

Commenting on the achievement, Mr Anil Sardana, managing director, Tata Power
said, "We are proud to reach this significant milestone in the city of Mumbai by
driving the message of energy & resource conservation. Our actions and
contributions have borne fruit and have had a positive impact on the
environment. It's our endeavour to take the programme to higher levels
especially by inculcating moral and civic values in these children."

More than 5.2 million (52 lakh) citizens have been sensitized across the nation
and more than 8.7 million units of electricity have been saved till date! The
Club is proud to have more than 92,174 Energy Champions and 1, 38,209 Energy
Ambassadors who are spreading the mantra of energy conservation among people
across various age and income groups. Today, there are 1059 mini Club Enerjis
across the country, which are run by school children with the aim to stop
wastage of electricity. The energy conservation programme has been taken up as
project work in various schools. This year, the movement has taken to the
streets with mini clubs organizing and spearheading mass sensitization
activities across the nation like rallies, street plays, public addresses during
festivals like Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratra etc and also through
participation in national conferences on energy conservation.

'Tata Power Club Enerji', is active in schools in eleven prominent cities of
India viz. Mumbai, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jamshedpur, Lonavla, Belgaum,
Ranchi, Haldia, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Maithon. It aims at creating awareness
among school students who in turn sensitize their families and neighbourhood to
curtail energy wastage through dynamic and innovative measures.

Rigel stock slides on 'green' woes

BYLINE: Laurie Ward

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 191 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Shares of Rigel Energy Corp. dropped $2 1/2 on the Toronto Stock Exchange to $17
1/4 yesterday on news that the Alberta government's Energy Resources
Conservation Board is seeking public comment on the proposed drilling program of
Rigel and partner Husky Oil Ltd.

Rigel and privately owned Husky are hoping to start exploring for oil in the
environmentally sensitive Moose Mountain area in the Foothills near Calgary.

The conservation board's decision to advertise the proposed $25-million
exploration program is normal practice. But a source, who asked not to be
identified, said Husky, which has a majority interest in the Moose Mountain
project, had hoped to get around the procedure by launching an intensive public
consultation program to win over support.

Environmentalists have launched a vociferous campaign to block development in
the region.

Complaints or objections could trigger a full-scale conservation board hearing,
which could delay drilling by as much as a year.

Rigel has a one-third stake in the project and Husky has two-thirds. Triton
Canada Resources Ltd. gets a 12% royalty from Rigel's stake.

Club Enerji's awareness campaign during Ganesh festival

BYLINE: Chittaranjan Tembhekar

SECTION: MUMBAI

LENGTH: 297 words


MUMBAI: Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation movement has
gained tremendous impetus due to the focus and dedication of school children to
spread awareness about resource conservation across the country. Continuing with
these efforts, Club Enerji on Thursday announced a host of activities, specially
designed around the celebrations of Ganesh Utsav across Mumbai.

The Ganesh festival witnesses a huge jump in energy consumption over the ten
days when pandals are decorated with multiple lights. The objective of this
initiative is to educate the citizens on the importance of bringing down the
level of energy consumption and finding a balance between festivities and
wasting resources. Mini Club Enerji students from multiple schools will be
carrying out several initiatives such as cycle rallies to spread the message of
energy and resource conservation, awareness sessions at traffic signals and
sensitization drives at Ganesh Utsav pandals. The students will also be
promoting green activities like using LED lights, switching off and use of
traditional lights over electric lights, saving fuel, etc.

Students from the following schools will be participating in the activity; BPS
High School Bhandup, Vidyaprabodhini School Mulund, IES School Mulund, Pawar
Public School Bhandup, Pawar Public School Kandivli, Fr Agnelo School Malad,
Cambridge School Thakur Complex, C U Shah High School Kandivli, and Ashok Nagar
Pioneer Education Society School Kandivli. During the festive season, many
people gather at various pandals throughout the city, and celebrate Lord Ganesha
with pomp and glory. The students aim to inform the devotees of the judicious
use of energy, thereby educating them of the dire need of resource conservation.

Plains Midstream Canada Responds To Pipeline Release In Northern Alberta

   Jun 15, 2013

   Plains Midstream Canada responded to a condensate release on its Kemp
pipeline system approximately 90 km north west of Manning, Alberta. The Kemp
pipeline system is a six-inch diameter, 79 km system that transports condensate
and other NGL, a by-product of processed natural gas. The company's emergency
response procedures have been activated and the pipeline has been shut down.
Response personnel and equipment are on site and additional resources are en
route.Plains Midstream Canada notified the ERCB and local authorities. The cause
of the release is not yet known and no estimate of volume is available at this
time.


Maxim Power Receives Approval From ERCB For Coal Beneficiation Plant In Canada

   May 29, 2013

   Maxim Power Corp. (Maxim Power) announced that the Alberta Energy and
Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) issued an approval to the company's wholly
owned subsidiary, Milner Power Inc., to construct and operate a coal
beneficiation plant in proximity to the Milner generating station. Maxim Power
now has all necessary environmental approvals to construct and operate a coal
beneficiation facility.The new coal beneficiation plant, designated by the ERCB
as Coal Processing Plant No. 11, will be used to bifurcate coal mined from the
Maxim Power's Summit Coal Mine 14 into a high-quality, low-mid volatile,
metallurgical coal for shipment to export markets, and a fuel grade coal
suitable for power production at the Milner generating station. The planned new
beneficiation plant is capable of processing run-of-mine coal at a rate of 1.3
million tonnes per annum. Maxim Power considers its Summit Coal resources, which
are comprised of Mine 14 and Mine 16S, to be valuable strategic assets. Mine 14
is a fully permitted mine that will be located north of Grande Cache, Alberta
and is currently estimated to contain 18.9 million recoverable tonnes of high
quality metallurgical coal. Mine 16S is located 30km northwest of Mine 14 and
represents 29% of Summit's total area of leases. An NI 43-101 Technical Report
has not been prepared for the Mine 16S property. Summit's potential coal
resources have significant value both as a fuel source for Maxim Power's
existing Milner generating facility and for the sale of export metallurgical
coal. Maxim Power anticipates that Mine 14 and the coal beneficiation plant will
commence construction in 2013 and will commence commercial operation in the
first quarter of 2015.


Butte Energy Provides Operations Update

   May 13, 2013

   Butte Energy Inc. provided an update on its operations. The Chigwell Viking
4-35-42-26 W4 well was shut-in effective January 2012 pending a hearing and
ruling on a special well holding application filed on December 21, 2011 with the
Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB). Such hearing was necessitated as a
result of an objection by Glencoe Resources Ltd., operator of the immediately
adjacent CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) scheme.The company has received
notification from the ERCB that its special well holding application has been
denied. The 4-35 well will continue to be shut-in until the company applies for
and obtains approval from the ERCB for its independent EOR scheme. While denying
the company's holding application, the ERCB's ruling confirmed key elements of
the company's holding application that are worthy of note. The company always
contended that its section 35 lands are being influenced and inequitably drained
by Glencoe's EOR scheme, to which the ERCB noted in its ruling, 'the examiners
accept that C02 injection at Glencoe's 14-26 well has swept some oil from
Section 35 to Glencoe's 8-34 well.' The company, in response to this significant
drainage, is reviewing and weighing all options, including an independent EOR
scheme and any civil actions required to aggressively protect its reserves and
to recover the reserves, swept to date, from its section 35 lands. In addition,
approval from the ERCB to place the PEOC HZ Plain 3-4-55-12 W4 well on
production has been obtained. The well is awaiting tie-in prior to being placed
on production.


ERCB Resumes All Business Operations After Production Outage

   Apr 22, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) has successfully completed
testing of all of its internal and external systems impacted by the April 3,
2013 production outage and has officially resumed all business operations. The
ERCB is now able to receive all electronic submissions.The ERCB has been working
to ensure applications are processed quickly and efficiently and has taken
measures to manage the possibility of a higher than normal volume of electronic
submissions in the coming days. While completing a routine hardware upgrade on
April 2, 2013 ERCB staff discovered that some ERCB production servers were
unavailable. While working to repair the affected file servers, additional
servers developed problems on April 3, 2013. All systems were shut down on April
4, 2013 while the ERCB implemented business recovery activities. The ERCB will
continue work to enhance and strengthen all systems and a third party review
will be conducted to identify the root cause and recommend improvements to
mitigate the risks of future outages.


ERCB To Conduct Business Testing And Recovery Operations

   Apr 18, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is now conducting testing and
recovery of its application systems impacted by the production outage that
occurred April 4, 2013. As systems are brought back into operation, operators
may receive automatically generated emails from the ERCB. Operators are advised
that the links in these emails may not function until full operations are
resumed. The ERCB will make a formal announcement when all systems are fully
operational.Incident reporting, monitoring, and emergency response capabilities
are not impacted by this outage. The ERCB continues to carry out field
surveillance activities including inspections, monitoring, and responding to
landowner concerns. As a result of the outage, the ERCB cannot receive
electronic applications filed by industry, and ERCB-generated reports are
unavailable. The outage has also affected the ERCB's ability to fulfill
information product orders from information dissemination services and disrupted
all activities at the core research centre.


ERCB Working To Address Issues Affecting Electronic Applications Systems

   Apr 12, 2013

   The production outage affecting Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)
application systems continues. Outside experts have been brought in and are
working with staff around the clock to restore operations. It is unknown how
long the service interruption will last.Incident reporting, response, and
monitoring and emergency response capabilities are not impacted by this outage.
The ERCB continues to carry out field surveillance activities including
inspections, monitoring, and responding to landowner concerns. In order to
ensure that critical operations continue, the ERCB will accept and process
applications that are deemed by the ERCB to be urgent and critical via e-mail.
Applicants are required to provide detailed, compelling reasons to support the
processing of such applications. The outage is affecting many programs and
impeding the organization's ability to receive applications and data submissions
electronically. As a result, the ERCB cannot receive electronic applications
filed by industry, and ERCB-generated reports are unavailable. The outage has
also affected the ERCB's ability to fulfill information product orders from
Information Dissemination Services and disrupted all activities at the core
research centre. While completing a routine hardware upgrade on April 2, 2013,
ERCB staff discovered that some ERCB production servers were unavailable. While
working to repair the affected file servers, additional servers developed
problems on April 3, 2013. The ERCB took action to idle affected business
systems late on April 4, 2013 to prevent loss and damage to data, and
consequently the ERCB has not been able to accept industry applications and
other submissions since April 4, 2013. The ERCB issued an announcement on April
5, 2013 advising of the outage and provided a further update on April 7, 2013
while the situation was being assessed.


ERCB Announces Production Outage

   Apr 07, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is continuing recovery efforts
on many of the organization's core systems due to an unplanned production
outage. All external ERCB systems will continue to be down until further notice.
The outage has also affected the ERCB's ability to fulfill information product
orders from information services and all activities at the core research centre
(CRC).


ERCB Denies Bernum Petroleum Horizontal Well Applications

   Apr 04, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) has issued Decision 2013-004,
which denies applications by Bernum Petroleum Ltd. to drill two horizontal oil
wells and construct a multi-well battery approximately 4.7 km east of Cochrane,
Alberta. The denial is without prejudice to any future application that Bernum
Petroleum may submit.The ERCB denied the battery application on the basis that
it would be economic to conserve gas and therefore flaring would not be allowed
as per ERCB regulations. The well applications were denied for this location as
it could not accommodate the company's future development plans. The board found
that alternative locations exist in this area that could be developed in
accordance with regulations and accommodate the applied-for and future wells.
The decision follows a public hearing in Calgary, Alberta, from November 27,
2012 to December 5, 2012.


Nordic Oil and Gas Receives Approval For Pipeline In Joffre, Alberta

   Mar 15, 2013

   Nordic Oil and Gas Ltd. announced that the approval has finally been received
from the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) for installation of a
pipeline in Joffre, Alberta. Construction of the pipeline will begin early next
week, and the company anticipates that it will be in position to turn on its
11-13-38-25 W4 well later next week. In addition, once the pipeline is
operational, Nordic Oil and Gas also plans on bringing back onto production
three other natural gas wells in the area.Donald Benson, chairman and CEO of
Nordic Oil and Gas, said, "With the rise in Natural Gas prices and the
expectations that the price could continue to rise, this is an excellent time
for us to be bringing these Joffre wells back onto production." The revenue from
the 11-13 well, along with the others, will have a strong impact on the
company's second quarter revenue. Once all of the wells are back on production,
Nordic Oil and Gas will then commence work on bringing its large compressor
station back on line.


ERCB Updates LLR Program To Protect Albertans From Abandonment And Reclamation
Costs

   Mar 12, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) updated its licensee liability
rating (LLR) program to ensure abandonment and reclamation of oil and gas
facilities are covered by industry. The ERCB requires oil and gas operators to
post financial security deposits to cover the abandonment and reclamation costs
of upstream oil and gas wells, facilities, and pipelines in the event a licensee
becomes defunct.Following an extensive review, the ERCB determined that
liability costs must be increased to minimize financial risk to the Orphan Well
Association and to protect Albertans from the costs to abandon and reclaim
upstream oil and gas facilities from defunct licensees. Effective May 1, 2013,
the ERCB will require 248 licensees to post financial security of US$297 million
over a three year period. Licensees may pursue options to lower the amount of
financial security, including transferring licenses, returning suspended wells
to production, or abandoning suspended wells. The ERCB's license liability
program compares a licensee's assets with its liabilitiesand requires companies
to pay a security if liabilities exceed assets. If a company fails to pay the
required security, the ERCB may take enforcement measures, which include
ordering a facility's suspension and abandonment.


ERCB Issues Enforcement Action Against Pembina Pipeline And Pengrowth Energy For
2011 Spills

   Feb 26, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) issued a high-risk enforcement
action against Pembina Pipeline Corporation and a low-risk enforcement action
against Pengrowth Energy for pipeline spills that occurred in mid-2011.Following
the spills, the ERCB launched comprehensive investigations that involved
numerous ERCB staff, included technical reviews of the causes of the incidents
and emergency response activities, and identified specific areas for company
improvement and recommendations for enforcement action. A high-risk enforcement
action was issued against Pembina Pipeline for neglecting to immediately inform
the ERCB about a pipeline spill on July 20, 2011 near Swan Hills. On August 15,
2011, a second failure occurred on the same pipeline about 1,600 meters from the
July 20, 2011 failure. Through the investigation, the ERCB determined that both
pipeline failures were caused by circumferential stress corrosion cracking. The
ERCB also directed the company to develop and implement a dig program to inspect
for, identify, and address potential stress corrosion cracking in all pipelines
that are in a condition similar to the condition of the pipeline that failed,
and to share with its peers the knowledge gained from the incidents to ensure an
industry-wide response to prevent similar pipeline failures in the future.
Pengrowth Energy has been issued a low-risk enforcement action for operating the
pipeline for more than a year under faulty construction practices before a
pipeline failure on June 26, 2011, near Swan Hills. The ERCB has directed the
company to immediately modify its construction management system to incorporate
and control all aspects of pipeline design and construction activities,
including clear definitions of roles, responsibilities, experience, and
expectations of anyone involved in pipeline design, construction, and
inspection. Pengrowth must also develop, adopt, maintain, and communicate
written procedures to ensure the design, configuration, and testing of pipeline
automated systems to properly anticipate and prevent similar problems in the
future.


ERCB Issues Enforcement Action Against Plains Midstream Canada For 2011 Spill

   Feb 26, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) issued four high-risk
enforcement actions against Plains Midstream Canada in relation to a 2011 oil
spill on the NPS20 Rainbow pipeline in Northern Sunrise county.Following the
spill, the ERCB launched a comprehensive investigation that involved numerous
ERCB staff, included a technical review of the causes of the incident and
emergency response activities, and identified specific areas for company
improvement and recommendations for enforcement action. Through the
investigation, the ERCB identified four areas in which Plains Midstream Canada
failed to comply with regulatory requirements. As a result, the ERCB issued
high-risk enforcement action against the company for inadequate backfill and
compaction procedures, inadequate operations and maintenance procedures,
inadequate leak detection and response, and failure to test its emergency
response plan. In addition to the high-risk enforcement action, the
investigation report also describes the company's substandard efforts, beyond
initial notification, to ensure that the public and other stakeholders were kept
informed of the incident and its progress. As a result, Plains Midstream Canada
has been directed to engage a third party to conduct an audit of the company's
ability to manage communications during a crisis, with the results submitted to
the ERCB no later than April 30, 2013. To further minimize the risk of a similar
incident, the ERCB has also directed Plains Midstream Canada to complete the
following actions: implement risk assessment procedures that identify all
current and historical risks associated with pipelines of the same type conduct
a major emergency response exercise by March 31, 2013, with results submitted to
the ERCBand confirm and demonstrate that the enhanced backfill procedures have
been incorporated into the company's standard operating procedures. At the time
of the incident, the ERCB required the company to conduct a number of activities
to ensure the pipeline could be operated safely before the ERCB would consider
granting approval for it to restart. Conducted under ERCB supervision, these
activities included excavation of all welded pipeline sleeves for ERCB
inspection weekly aerial patrols of the pipeline implementation of improved leak
detection and pipeline restart proceduresand revision of its backfill and
compaction procedures. Since the incident, Plains Midstream Canada has been
subject to an increased frequency of ERCB audits and inspections of the
company's pipeline operations. Failure to comply with all ERCB-directed actions
will result in the escalation of enforcement action, which can include partial
or full suspension of operations. On April 28, 2011, Plains Midstream Canada
experienced a pipeline failure on its NPS20 Rainbow Pipeline, approximately 95
km northeast of Peace River in Northern Sunrise county. The failure resulted in
a release of approximately 4,450 cu m (28,000 bbls) of crude oil. Following
extensive ERCB assessment and a number of technical and safety requirements,
approval was granted to restart the pipeline on August 26, 2011. The pipeline
has been in operation since August 30, 2011. The site has been cleaned up, and
reclamation and remediation efforts are still underway.


ERCB Responding To Release At Questerre Energy Well Site Near Grande Cache

   Jan 11, 2013

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is responding to an
uncontrolled release of completion fluids from a Questerre Energy Corporation
well completion operation 45 km north of Grande Cache.Questerre Energy
temporarily evacuated their workers from the site as a precaution. Air
monitoring detected extremely low levels of hydrogen sulfide on hwy 40 north of
Grande Cache. No waterways are impacted at this time. There were no injuries as
a result of the release. All appropriate agencies have been notified. The ERCB
is onsite and will continue to work with the company and other agencies to
ensure that the incident is controlled, contained, and all appropriate clean up
and mitigation measures take place. The ERCB will be conducting an investigation
into the cause of the incident.


ERCB Releases Investigation Report On Hydraulic Fracturing Incident Near Grande
Prairie, Alberta

   Dec 20, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) issued its investigation
report that includes details of a high-risk enforcement action against Crew
Energy for a hydraulic fracturing incident that occurred near Grande Prairie on
September 21, 2011. The ERCB investigation concludes that Crew Energy improperly
perforated and hydraulically fractured at a shallow depth.In issuing high risk
enforcement the ERCB noted the following regulatory non-compliances: Failure to
use only non-toxic fracture fluids above the base of groundwater protectionand
Failure to recognize and properly assess a number of issues that led to the
perforation and fracturing above the base of groundwater protection. As a result
of enforcement action being taken, the ERCB required the company to develop and
implement a corrective action plan that details measures to prevent similar
incidents from occurring in the future. The ERCB is currently auditing the
company's action plan. Additionally, Crew Energy is required to provide all
analysis from its Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development
directed groundwater monitoring program to the ERCB. Incidents of this nature
are very rare. More than 171,000 oil and gas wells have been hydraulically
fractured in Alberta since the 1950s. In recent years, more than 4,000
multi-stage hydraulic fracturing operations have been conducted in Alberta.


Cavalier Energy Files Regulatory Application For Hoole Grand Rapids Project In
Canada

   Dec 17, 2012

   Cavalier Energy Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount Resources Ltd.,
filed a regulatory application for the Hoole Grand Rapids project with the
Energy Resources Conservation Board and Alberta Environment and Sustainable
Resource Development, in November 2012. The project comprises a 10,000bpd
in-situ SAGD oil sands development.Subject to receipt of regulatory approval,
the current Hoole Grand Rapids project schedule anticipates first steam in 2015
and the first full year of production in 2016. William Roach, president and CEO
of Cavalier Energy, said, "The Hoole project presents a great platform from
which to grow Cavalier into a significant oil sands production company." Further
to the submission of the regulatory application, Cavalier Energy expects to
receive a reserves report for the project from its independent engineering
evaluators in the first quarter of 2013. Jim Riddell, president and COO of
Paramount Resources, said, "This is a major step forward for Paramount and the
Cavalier team. This is Paramount's first operated, strategic investment in the
oil sands, and we look forward to the Cavalier team creating significant
shareholder value at Hoole."


ERCB Seeking Feedback On Regulatory Approach For Unconventional Development

   Dec 17, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is accepting feedback on the
regulation of future unconventional resource development. Regulating
Unconventional Oil And Gas in Alberta â[#x20ac]" a discussion paper outlines a
new approach to oil and gas regulation that encourages early and meaningful
stakeholder engagement, minimizes surface impacts, protects water, and maximizes
resource recovery.Dan McFadyen, chairman of ERCB, said, Alberta has a long
history of regulating safe and responsible oil and gas development. The
discussion paper continues that strong record by describing a proposed
regulatory approach that is innovative and progressive. We invite Albertans to
comment on the proposed approach to ensure that the regulatory objectives are
appropriate. The technology used to develop unconventional resources is not new
in Albertahowever, the scale of the developments has the potential to be much
larger than Albertans may have experienced in the past. To address the
associated challenges with large-scale developments, the ERCB has suggested a
new regulatory approach that includes moving from well-by-well regulation to
regulation focused on development within a defined area. This play-focused
regulation would be performance-based to achieve specific outcomes in public
safety, water protection, air quality, waste management, surface impacts,
resource conservation, and orderly development. Approximately 171,000 wells in
Alberta have been stimulated using hydraulic fracturing since the technology was
first introduced in the 1950s. Since 2008, approximately 5,000 horizontal wells
have been drilled in Alberta using multi-stage hydraulic fracturing to enhance
oil and gas recovery.


ERCB Releases Investigation Report On Hydraulic Fracturing Incident Near
Innisfail, Alberta

   Dec 12, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) released its investigation
report into a Midway Energy Ltd. (Midway Energy) hydraulic fracturing incident
that occurred near Innisfail, Alberta on January 13, 2012. The ERCB's
investigation into the incident concludes that Midway Energy's hydraulic
fracturing operation resulted in an increase in pressure in a nearby Wild Stream
Exploration Inc. well, causing a release of fluid to surface at the Wild Stream
wellhead.Communication between the two wells occurred within the same formation
at a depth of approximately 1,850m below the surface. The wellbores were
approximately 129m apart at their closest point. The fracturing in formation
created by Midway Energy's hyraulic fracturing operation resulted in
communication pathways between the two wells and resultant pressure increase in
the Wildstream well resulted in a release of fracturing and formation fluids to
surface. The ERCB investigation concludes that Midway Energy and Wild Stream
appropriately managed the incident, mitigated potential environmental damage,
and disposed of the oilfield waste in compliance with regulatory standards and
that the incident did not impact the public, livestock, groundwater, or surface
water bodies. On January 23, 2012, the ERCB issued Bulletin 2012-02: Hydraulic
Fracturing: Interwellbore Communication between Energy Wells in response to the
incident. Subsequently, on December 6, 2012, the ERCB released a draft directive
that addresses sub-surface issues related to hydraulic fracturing, including the
prevention of interwellbore communication, well integrity and well completions
in shallow zones. Incidents of this nature are very rare. More than 171,000 oil
and gas wells have been hydraulically fractured in Alberta since the 1950s. In
recent years, more than 5,000 multi-stage hydraulic fracturing operations have
been conducted in horizontal wells in Alberta.


ERCB Seeking Feedback Regarding Draft Hydraulic Fracturing Directive

   Dec 06, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is accepting feedback on
proposed requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities.The ERCB has reviewed
the challenges and opportunities related to the use of hydraulic fracturing in
combination with horizontal drilling in the development of Alberta's
conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources. The ERCB is now seeking
feedback on a draft directive that addresses sub-surface issues related to the
increasing use of this activity. The draft directive provides clarity on:
Preventing interwellbore communication impacts, Ensuring well integrity, and
Requirements for wells completed in shallow zones, which apply to any depths
shallower than 100 meters below the base of groundwater protection. Alberta has
a long history of regulating safe and responsible oil and gas development. The
draft directive builds upon a strong foundation of regulation to address
potential risks identified in the ERCB's review. Surface impacts related to
hydraulic fracturing activity will be addressed in the months to come. Albertans
are encouraged to provide feedback on the directive and to help shape the ERCB's
regulations. Feedback on the directive will be accepted until January 18, 2013.
Hydraulic fracturing has been used to stimulate approximately 171,000 wells
since the technology was first introduced in the 1950s. It is one of several
well-established methods to enhance the recovery of oil and natural gas deposits
by fracturing the underground geological formation.


Alberta Geological Survey Identifies Huge Oil And Gas Resources

   Nov 05, 2012

   The Energy Resource Appraisal Group of the Energy Resources Conservation
Board of Alberta provided information related to the oil and gas resource
endowment of Alberta. The new study has identified immense oil and gas resources
in Alberta's emerging shale prospects, suggesting a string of recent takeovers
and land buys will yield impressive production gains for some of the world's
largest oil companies.The province's shale formations, including the Duvernay,
Montney and Muskwa, could ultimately contain 3,324tcf of natural gas, 58.6
billion barrels of gas liquids and 423.6 billion barrels of oil, according to
the research. According to the study, the Duvernay, a formation that cuts across
much of north-central Alberta, contains 443tcf of total gas in place, 11.3
billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 61.7 billion barrels of oil, at the
midpoint of the estimates. The Muskwa, in Northwestern Alberta, has an estimated
419tcf of gas, 14.8 billion barrels of gas liquids and 115.1 billion barrels of
oil. The Montney, in Western Alberta, is also a major exploration area in
neighboring British Columbia. On the Alberta side, natural gas resources are
estimated at 2,211tcf, gas liquids at 28.9 billion barrels and oil at 136.3
billion barrels.


Celtic Exploration Seeks Approval From ERCB For Energy Project In Canada

   Sep 14, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) received a application from
Celtic Exploration Ltd., pursuant to Section 80 of the Oil and Gas Conservation
Act (OGCA), for an order prescribing that all tracts within the drilling spacing
unit comprising Section 33, Township 60, Range 17, West of the 5th Meridian, be
operated as a unit for the production of gas from the Base of the Triassic
System to the Base of the Duvernay formation through a well to be drilled in
Legal Subdivision 13.Celtic Exploration requested, among other things, that
costs and revenues under the pooling order be allocated on a tract-area basis
and that it be named operator of the well to be produced. The applicant has also
requested that the maximum penalty allowed under the OGCA be applied to a tract
owner's share of the costs of drilling and completing a well in the formation
named in the order, if the tract owner does not pay the costs within 30 days of
the later of the pooling order being issued, the tract owner being notified in
writing of its share of the actual costs, or the well commencing production.

website. Group 10 will examine the adequacy of regulatory requirements with
respect to pipelines under ERCB jurisdiction and industry best practices in
three areas: public safety and responses to pipeline incidents, pipeline
integrity management, and safety of pipelines at or near water crossings. The
review will be conducted in addition to the current incident-specific
investigations the ERCB is conducting. The review is expected to be completed by
the end of November 2012 and the ERCB will provide Group 10's final report to
the minister by the end of the year. Following this, the ERCB will review the
Group 10 report and provide its own report, including resulting ERCB
recommendations, if any, to the minister by March 31, 2013. The ERCB's mission
is to ensure that the discovery, development and delivery of Alberta's energy
resources take place in a manner that is fair, responsible, and in the public
interest. In assessing the public interest, the ERCB has regard for public
safety, environmental stewardship, and resource conservation.


ERCB Seeks Feedback On Draft Hydraulic Fracturing Directive

   Sep 10, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is accepting feedback on
proposed requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities. Over the last 75
years, the ERCB developed and enforced regulations to ensure the responsible
development of Alberta's oil and gas resources.Constantly working to improve and
ensure the relevancy of all regulations, the ERCB reviews and updates its rules
in light of new issues, risks, opportunities, and challenges and adapts as
technology, experience, and social expectations have evolved. The ERCB reviewed
the challenges and opportunities related to the use of hydraulic fracturing in

ERCB Approves Enbridge Pipeline Application

   Aug 30, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), issued Decision 2012 ABERCB
009, which approves Enbridge Inc.'s (Enbridge's) applications to construct and
operate two pump stations and a pipeline that would transport diluted bitumen
from Fort McMurray to Sherwood Park.The proposed pipeline route generally
parallels several existing pipelines and is approximately 385km in length. It is
proposed to transport an initial capacity of 400,000bpd of diluted bitumen
containing no hydrogen sulfide. A number of parties objected to the
applications, but after Enbridge altered the proposed route of the pipeline,
several landowners withdrew their objections. All objections were resolved as of
the beginning of the hearing, except one, from a party whose land had been
included on the originally proposed route. The ERCB held a hearing June
18â[#x20ac]"19, 2012 in Edmonton to consider the applications.


ERCB Responding To Penn West Pipeline Release Near Red Deer

ERCB Announces 7% Growth In Conventional Crude Oil Production And Revised
In-place Estimates Four Bitumen Deposits

   Jun 20, 2012

   The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) released Alberta's Energy
Reserves 2011 and Supply/Demand Outlook 2012â[#x20ac]"2021, which outlines the
state of reserves and the supply and demand outlook for Alberta's diverse energy
resources: crude bitumen, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, coal, and
sulphur.In 2011, Alberta's crude oil production totaled 77.9 thousand cu m
(490,000 barrels) of oil per day with a yearly total of 28.4 MMcm (179 MMbbl).
This is a 7% increase from 2010, the first rise in production since 1995. This
increase is due to the higher production rates of horizontal wells. The
Athabasca Upper, Middle, and Lower Grand Rapids deposits and the Athabasca Nisku
deposit were reassessed for year-end 2011. The review of the three grand rapids
deposits resulted in a 7% increase of the total in-place crude bitumen resource
to 9.3bcm (58.4 billion barrels), which is attributed to an increased number of
wells drilled in the area. The reassessment of the Nisku deposit resulted in a
57% increase of the in-place resource to 16.2bcm (102 billion barrels), which is
attributed to an increase in average thickness and an expansion of the
delineated resource area. In 2011, Alberta produced 277,000cu m (1.7 MMbbl) per
day of raw crude bitumen from the oil sands for a yearly total of 101 MMcm (637
MMbbl) or an 8% increase over Alberta's 2010 oil sands production. The ERCB
forecasts Alberta's annual raw crude bitumen production will total 587.3
thousand cu m (3.7 MMbbl) per day for a total of 214 MMcm (1.35 billion barrels)
per year by 2021. The report notes that, since 1967, Alberta has produced about
1.3bcm (8.1 billion barrels) of raw crude bitumen from the oil sands and has
produced about 2.6bcm (16.5 billion barrels) of crude oil since 1914. Other
report highlights include: Alberta's total remaining established crude bitumen
and crude oil reserves totaled 27bcm (170.2 billion barrels), consisting of
26.8bcm (168.6 billion barrels) of crude bitumen and 245.9 MMcm (1.5 billion
barrels) of crude oil Remaining established crude oil reserves increased by a
net 4%, similar to the increase last year, as the cumulative result of reserves
additions from 2011 drilling, reserve revisions, and production Remaining
established marketable conventional gas reserves stood at 945bcm (33.5tcf), a
decrease of 8% from 2010 Remaining established reserves of natural gas liquids
stood at 254.5 MMcm (1.6 billion barrels), down 3% from 2010 Alberta's remaining
established coal reserves are down very slightly and stand at 33 billion tonnes
(37 billion tons).

Kallisto Energy Provides Operations Update

   Feb 27, 2012

   Kallisto Energy Corp. (Kallisto Energy) announced that its ninth Pembina,
Alberta horizontal Cardium oil well has been drilled, completed, flow-tested and
is awaiting tie-in of a gas conservation pipeline to allow the well to be placed
on production. The well, located at 12-34-047-03 W5M, commenced drilling on
February 1, 2012.Completion operations, which included an 18 stage energized
water fracture stimulation, were completed on February 16, 2012. The cost of
drilling and completing the well is expected to be approximately $2,373,000m,
($712,000 net to the company). In addition, the eighth Pembina oil well, located
at 5-34-047-03 W5M, was placed on production November 25, 2011. Production for
the first 30 days from the 5-34 well averaged approximately 226boepd (68 net to
the company), including approximately 198bopd (59 net to the company). Kallisto
Energy has a 30% working interest in all of its Pembina oil wells. Crossfield
Drilling License Application On September 2, 2011, the company submitted an
application to the Energy Resources Conservation Board ("ERCB") to drill a well
at 11-26-027-01 W5M to test the Lower Manville formation. Kallisto Energy
previously confirmed commercial productivity of this formation with the drilling
of a well located at 10-34-027-1 W5M. CrossAlta Gas Storage & Services Ltd.
filed an objection to Kallisto Energy's license application. The ERCB held a
public hearing into the drilling application commencing on January 10, 2012 and
announced its decision to grant Kallisto Energy the drilling license on February
24, 2012. The drilling license was issued the same day. Conditions of the
license restrict fracture completions to 40 tonnes and require certain pressure
measurements. The company expects to spud the 11-26 well in early March 2012,
subject to weather conditions and rig availability. Should the 11-26 well be
successful, management anticipates completing an expanded 3D seismic program on
its lands to identify additional drilling locations. Kallisto Energy holds more
than 5,000 net acres of land in the Crossfield area it believes to be
prospective for this geological target.


Osum Oil Sands Announces Change In Regulatory Hearing For Taiga Project

   Feb 24, 2012

   Osum Oil Sands Corp. received notice that the Energy Resources Conservation
Board (ERCB) has scheduled a hearing for May 23, 2012 in respect of its Taiga
Project application. The application, submitted in December of 2009, seeks
approval to produce up to 35,000 barrels of bitumen per day through in-situ
thermal extraction methods (which use wells and involve no strip mining or
tailings ponds).The Taiga project will not use fresh water in its production
process, instead relying on undrinkable brackish water from a deep aquifer in
the region. As well, water recycling technologies with efficiencies of greater
than 90% will be used, and cogeneration will be implemented in the second phase
of the development to increase the project's energy efficiency, enabling it to
become almost entirely self-sufficient in terms of its electricity requirements.
Steve Spence, president and CEO of Osum Oil Sands, said, We are tremendously
excited to move ahead with our Taiga project and are eager to demonstrate the
benefits of the project to the surrounding communities and to the province as a
whole. We take an active interest in the concerns and opinions of our neighbors
and look forward to continuing our discussions with them to find solutions that
work the best for everyone. Osum Oil Sands has been engaged in consultation
efforts relating to the Taiga project since 2008 and continues to work with area
residents and invest in the community. During this time, the company has made
significant changes to its proposed development as a result of ongoing dialog
with local stakeholders, including moving the location of the central processing
facility and well pad placements. In recent weeks, the Municipal District of
Bonnyville, the City of Cold Lake and the Town of Bonnyville have all sent
letters of support to the provincial government. Osum Oil Sands has also
received letters of non-objection from several of its First Nations neighbors in
the area. Rick Walsh, EVP of development and operations, Osum Oil Sands, said,
The news of a date for the hearing is a positive development which moves the
application along an established process and clarifies some of the uncertainty
for supply chain partners, potential employees, shareholders and community
partners. Having a greater understanding of where we are in the process will
enable us to share a more reliable blueprint of our path forward with our
vendors and community partners. The Cold Lake area currently yields
approximately 340,000bopd (over 10% of Canada's oil production) and is known for
crude that is lighter and higher in quality than in the Athabasca region.

Wednesday, May 22, 2013: In line with its philosophy to curb wastage of energy
and spread awareness about energy conservation, Club Enerji, Tata Power's
nationwide energy and resource conservation movement spearheaded by school
children, has gained momentum across the nation.

In the year 2012-13, Tata Power Club Enerji sensitised around 12,48,664 citizens
and saved more than 14,56,850 million units of energy in the city of Mumbai
alone, which can light up 682 houses. The units saved by the Club are equivalent
to saving around 1457 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Tata Power's nationwide movement
propagating energy and resource conservation had its enthusiastic members pledge
continuing commitment to the cause they have embarked upon.

Due to the increasing demand for effective management and conservation of
resources, Tata Power, India's largest integrated power utility, started a
unique initiative of energy conservation through school children called "Tata
Power Club Enerji" in 2007.

said, "We are proud to reach this significant milestone in the city of Mumbai by
driving the message of energy & resource conservation. Our actions and
contributions have borne fruit and have had a positive impact on the
environment. It's our endeavour to take the programme to higher levels
especially by inculcating moral and civic values in these children."

More than 5.2 million (52 lakh) citizens have been sensitized across the nation
and more than 8.7 million units of electricity have been saved till date! The
Club is proud to have more than 92,174 Energy Champions and 1, 38,209 Energy
Ambassadors who are spreading the mantra of energy conservation among people
across various age and income groups. Today, there are 1059 mini Club Enerjis
across the country, which are run by school children with the aim to stop
wastage of electricity. The energy conservation programme has been taken up as
project work in various schools. This year, the movement has taken to the
streets with mini clubs organizing and spearheading mass sensitization
activities across the nation like rallies, street plays, public addresses during
festivals like Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratra etc and also through
participation in national conferences on energy conservation.

'Tata Power Club Enerji', is active in schools in eleven prominent cities of
India viz. Mumbai, New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Pune, Jamshedpur, Lonavla, Belgaum,
Ranchi, Haldia, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Maithon. It aims at creating awareness
among school students who in turn sensitize their families and neighbourhood to
curtail energy wastage through dynamic and innovative measures.

ERCB HAS NEW FEE IN THE WINGS

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D6

LENGTH: 706 words


Unveiling of levy for 'orphan well' fund muddied by questions about political
timing

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board is planning to charge new oil
companies a one-time, $ 10,000 fee to drill a first well.

Some industry and ERCB officials believe the Klein government has ordered the
formal notice delayed until after Alberta's June 15 election.

"That's the directive from the government," said a board source. "It will have
to wait until after the 15th of June," said an industry source.

Energy Minister Pat Black said there is no gag order. She has not seen a copy of
the new fee proposal but says there is no reason the ERCB can't release it.

At the request of Black, ERCB co-chair Phil Prince called the Herald to say he
asked board officials not to hurry in the release. Prince said the notice was
still being worked on, needed board approval, and he didn't want anything to
interfere with the election. However, he says there is no reason to delay it,
especially if it's seen as government intervention. He said he wanted to
maintain the board's neutrality during the election.

It wasn't intended to cause any problem, Prince said. "I may push it now in the
other direction. I have no problem releasing the thing."

The new $ 10,000 fee is aimed at building a fund to pay for the downhole
restoration of orphan wells -- which can cost between $ 10,000 and $ 100,000
each to fix, said John Nichol, the ERCB's manager of drilling and production.

The fund establishes industry responsibility for clean-up, reducing public risk
for the hundreds of millions of dollars it's estimated to cost to clean up
Alberta's abandoned and orphaned wells, said David Sandmeyer, co-chairman of the
industry steering committee on orphan wells.

Orphan wells occur for several reasons, such as the bankruptcy or receivership
of the owner or the disappearance of the company from Alberta.

Established oil companies with a history of dealing with the ERCB will pay no
fee. The proposed $ 10,000 fee will apply only to companies applying for the
first time, said Nichol.

All companies currently pay a $ 500 administration fee for a well licence. And
they paid an orphan well levy of $ 40 for each well suspended last year,
generating about $ 1.5 million. This year the fee jumps to $ 60 per well, to
raise almost $ 2 million for securing an estimated 25 orphan wells, said Ken
Hunt, an ERCB engineer.

Nichol cautioned that the fee is now a proposal and no decision is expected
until later this summer. But after more than two years of discussion between the
board and industry, it's expected to pass, according to industry spokespersons.

The fee has reluctant approval from industry groups, including the Small
Explorers and Producers Association of Canada and Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers.

"It's another barrier to entry into the business," said David Wolf, chairman of
the small producers.

"That $ 10,000 fee is something that we're not particularly happy about, but the
alternatives (laws or policies enforced by government alone) are worse," said
Wolf, adding that it's a significant achievement marking industry-government
co-operation.

Sandmeyer, president of Rife Resources Ltd., said the new fee is designed to
prevent the same group of owners from setting up individual companies to drill
each well, which minimizes the clean-up liability to that single well.

"The $ 10,000 fee, one could argue, is earnest money to show that you wish you
have a serious desire to participate in the industry. There seemed to be a
number of corporations established to drill only one well . . . Of course, if
you walk away from that well, it doesn't affect any of your other corporate
entities," said Sandmeyer.

"It's certainly not intended to discourage legitimate participants," he said.

Although Alberta has about 700 oil and gas companies, an estimated 3,000
different companies own wells.

Nichol said the board has identified 17 ownerless orphan wells. Others are being
located.

Hunt said the new fee is expected to generate about $ 200,000 from 20 companies
toward the orphan well fund. The board wants to weed out non-serious players
without deterring credible firms.

Improving energy efficiency

BYLINE: Courtney Holden For the Camera

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 546 words


Energy issues are confusing for the public, surveys show.


A recent on-line poll of 3,400 by the University of Texas at Austin found that
fewer than 14 percent of Americans think the future of U.S. energy is headed in
the right direction. The poll -- which asks nearly 100 questions about energy
consumer sentiment, energy usage and priorities and energy satisfaction -- also
shows that more than 41 percent of Americans anticipate that the energy
situation will be worse 25 years from now.





 "What's happening in North America, but particularly in the U.S., is we're
bumping up against these resource limits," Brad Queen, energy divisions director
for the Center for ReSource Conservation, said. "It's having negative
implications in our economy."



 Among other findings: Only 24 percent of respondents consider themselves well-
versed in energy issues. That number is likely higher in eco-conscious Boulder,
and energy conservation advocates would like to keep it that way.







 "Historically, Boulder has been really active in conservation," said Jason
Love, energy adviser for the Center for ReSource Conservation, said. "We want to
maintain that reputation."



 One of the key things for consumers to remember is that energy conservation is
one of the most cost-effective way to reduce energy emissions.



 Love listed home-improvement actions such as adding insulation or replacing an
old furnace as options to improve energy efficiency. Energy consumers can also
take advantage of local subsidies on energy audits to determine how much energy
his or her home wastes.



 Local technology company, Tendril, offers another way to depict energy
consumption. Their energy-monitoring system provides an on-line platform that
houses real time updates about energy usage on a personalized website, giving
energy consumers access to that information and the ability to act on it.



 "You've got to make energy visible," Julie Rowey, Tendril's director of
marketing communications, said, emphasizing the importance of Tendril's on-line
dashboard where users can see where, when and why their energy expenditures
peaked.











 The poll also shows that more than 56 percent of Americans wish that the
government would do more to improve the energy outlook. Boulder's Renewable and
Sustainable Energy Institute Paul Komor Komor agrees that a top-down approach
for inspiring citizens might be the best method.



 "At the highest policy level we need more incentives for energy efficiency,
more ways that energy efficiency can be fairly evaluated," Komor said.







 In the meantime, here are some quick and easy ways to make your home more
energy efficient from the Center for Resource Conservation:



 Keep areas around heat vents clear of drapes and furniture so that they do not
block the flow of air.



 Invest in high efficiency window blinds or drapes with insulated linings.



 Turn off the water heater if you'll be away for more than two days.



 Use the energy saving settings on refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines
and clothes dryers.



 Position your refrigerator away from heat sources such as ovens and dishwashers
and out of direct sunlight.



 A warm dryer uses less energy, so try to wash and dry several loads in
succession.

MASSIVE NETWORK CLEARS MORE HURDLES

While energy board sets aside appeals, cabinet gives its OK to key gas permits

The Alberta-to-California pipeline project has moved closer to completion,
despite a last-ditch effort by critics to halt additions to capacity for exports
of natural gas.

Alberta's provincial cabinet has begun approving "removal permits" for gas to
fill the system.

The National Energy Board has rejected appeals for it to withdraw its 1992
approval of the main Canadian leg in the project.

Both developments surfaced as Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board
wrapped up Friday a week of hearings on an attempt to prevent construction of
the final piece in the massive package.

The case centres on applications by Nova Corp. to build $ 120 million in
additions to its Alberta gas-gathering web. The ERCB was told the new Nova
facilities are essential to fill the California line.

Approval is sought by March 1 to match construction schedules on the export
line: Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Pacific Gas Transmission Co. of San
Francisco, and Calgary's Alberta Natural Gas Co. and Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd.

But the ERCB also heard from leaders of the resistance: Altamont Gas
Transmission Co. and Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Altamont, part-owned by Amoco,
lost a race last year to build a different version of the California pipeline
project.

Altamont president Ewell Muse appealed to the ERCB to stop Nova and the Pacific
Gas family because its project might cut export prices and Alberta royalties on
them.

"You can't have a total abdication of your regulatory responsibilities," Muse
told the ERCB.

He said the board should accept responsibility for protecting Albertans'
financial interests.

The project's supporters suggest the new deliveries will compete with supply
sources in the United States and other fuels, such as oil.

Alberta's provincial cabinet endorsed the more optimistic expectations of the
supporters by granting four gas-removal permits that had awaited its final
endorsement since mid-December, when the ERCB recommended their approval.

The cabinet's action was widely seen as a sign it will not stall the pipeline
project. Thirteen more California removal-permit applications still await
rulings.

The NEB rejected an appeal to suspend its approval of the Alberta
Natural-Foothills leg in the line from Czar Resources Ltd., which agrees with
the gloomy predictions of Altamont and Amoco.

The ERCB agreed to hear final arguments from lawyers in the Nova case next week.
Board officials said a decision could be reached by Nova's target of March 1.

Deliveries, forecast to fetch about $ 1 billion a year, are scheduled to start
Nov. 1.

FARMER WINS GAS WELL FIGHT

BYLINE: ANDY MARSHALL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1/ FRONT

LENGTH: 451 words


An Alberta dairy farmer is ecstatic over a decision by the province's energy
watchdog which will limit oilfield activity on his property.

But, despite a call for better communication between farmers and the energy
industry, other ranchers warn Monday's verdict by the Energy Resources
Conservation Board on the Cy Skinner farm only strengthens their resolve to have
control over the investigation of energy industry issues taken away from the
board.

"We got everything we wanted," said Skinner, after learning Amax Petroleum must
remove a battery that takes production from sour wells on the Skinner home
quarter near Provost, 400 kilometres northeast of Calgary.

The 60-page ERCB report also specifies Amax will have to use directional
drilling to reach an oil pool beneath the Skinner farm.

Skinner was delighted with the board's ruling that ongoing air and groundwater
monitoring and "aggressive" cleanup of contaminated sites must be carried out at
the 260-cow operation.

"This sure was worth it . . . what more could we ask for?" he said after a
year-long dispute with Amax.

In addition, Amax will have to abandon nine wells nearest the farm within four
years, and reclaim the site for future use in the farming operation.

A decision on whether the board will pay all or part of more than $ 600,000
spent by Skinner to present his case has not yet been made.

No comment was available from Amax, but earlier comments from Chris Hemstock,
the company's senior engineer, suggested Amax may have to scale down its
operations there because of the dispute.

Mammoth hearings last spring produced 4,000 pages of detailed, scientific
testimony.

A board spokesman said the compromise decision sought to emphasize the need for
better communication between the petroleum industry and Alberta's farmers.

"There needs to be effective planning, with companies getting everybody's view
of things," said Shane Richardson, a senior board technician. "That was a
paramount consideration."

It was in the public interest, he said, for Amax to be able to develop the large
oil pool on the property - estimated royalties would total $ 9 million - and for
the Skinner operation to be able to flourish.

Meanwhile, Sundre area rancher Dennis Overguard, a delegate with the Alberta
Cattle Commission, said he was disappointed the board failed to establish a link
between oilfield activity and animal health on the Skinner farm.

A provincial study on his own property had shown the harmful effects of oilfield
waste on his cattle, he said.

"But if the board recognized it in the Skinner case, they would have to do it
with thousands of other cases -- and they would never do that."

Black.

Although oil companies are responsible for proper shutdown and clean-up
procedures when a well is abandoned, Black said there are now about 28 wells
across Alberta that have been left behind by owners who can't be traced.

The industry has agreed to set up a fund to cover the costs of abandoning these
wells, she said.

Bill 5, the Oil and Gas Conservation Amendment Act, provides a mechanism to set
up that fund and gives the Energy Resources Conservation Board authority to
order abandonment and procedures to follow, she said.

The fund will require about $ 2 million from the industry annually, said David
Sandmeyer, president of Rife Resources Ltd. and a board member of the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers.

The funds will be collected along with a levy companies pay to support ERCB
operations, he said. It will cover the costs of downhole abandonment and tidying
up of the surface area to meet safety requirements.

Some of the orphan wells were drilled early this century. Others were drilled
more recently but their owners just disappeared or went out of business.

Sandmeyer commended the ERCB's efforts in working with industry on the problem.

ERCB Seeking Feedback on Regulatory Approach for Unconventional Development

LENGTH: 390  words


New Delhi, Dec. 23 -- The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) is
accepting feedback on the regulation of future unconventional resource
development. Regulating Unconventional Oil and Gas in Alberta - a Discussion
Paper outlines a new approach to oil and gas regulation that encourages early
and meaningful stakeholder engagement, minimizes surface impacts, protects
water, and maximizes resource recovery.



"Alberta has a long history of regulating safe and responsible oil and gas
development," said ERCB Chairman Dan McFadyen. "The discussion paper continues
that strong record by describing a proposed regulatory approach that is
innovative and progressive. We invite Albertans to comment on the proposed
approach to ensure that the regulatory objectives are appropriate."

The technology used to develop unconventional resources is not new in Alberta;
however, the scale of the developments has the potential to be much larger than
Albertans may have experienced in the past. To address the associated challenges
with large-scale developments, the ERCB has suggested a new regulatory approach
that includes moving from well-by-well regulation to regulation focused on
development within a defined area. This play-focused regulation would be
performance-based to achieve specific outcomes in public safety, water
protection, air quality, waste management, surface impacts, resource
conservation, and orderly development.

Approximately 171,000 wells in Alberta have been stimulated using hydraulic
fracturing since the technology was first introduced in the 1950s. Since 2008,
approximately 5,000 horizontal wells have been drilled in Alberta using
multi-stage hydraulic fracturing to enhance oil and gas recovery.

Albertans are encouraged to participate in the review of the discussion paper,
to provide input on and help shape the new regulatory approach. Feedback will be
accepted until March 31, 2013. Visit www.ercb.ca for more information.

The ERCB is Alberta's primary energy regulator. For almost 75 yeas, we have been
committed to our mission: to ensure that the discovery, development and delivery
of Alberta's energy resources take place in a manner that is fair, responsible,
and in the public interest. In assessing the public interest, the ERCB has
regard for public safety, environmental stewardship, and resource conservation.

New buzzwords: politically sustainable

BYLINE: John Shiry

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 21, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 925 words


Gerry Kruk is one of a new breed of community-relations consultants working in
the oil patch. He helps companies to negotiate development projects with
communities and landowners who want to preserve their way of life. He does not
like the title ''public relations consultant.''

His most important project to date was to help Husky Oil battle Shell Canada
over the right to process sour gas from the giant Caroline gas field. Shell's
plan won, but Kruk feels the case marks a watershed in how resources are
developed in Alberta. ''The Caroline decision is not a confirmation of the old
process. It sets new standards for community involvement in development
decisions.''

The Caroline gas field contains about 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It
is the largest gas find in western Canada in 20 years. The gas is ''sour,''
meaning it contains large amounts of sulphur. Caroline makes up 26% of Alberta's
present sulphur reserves. The gas is also ''wet'' with other valuable
hydrocarbon products like condensate, ethane, propane and butane. The field is
expected to generate $10 billion in revenue over its 25-year life.


Caroline is only 120 kilometres northwest of Calgary. The picturesque area is a
retirement home for many oil industry professionals and a weekend retreat for
many Calgarians. Others actually commute to Calgary every day. The presence of
so many city-types meant there was a lot of industry and environmental expertise
in the community. That made these development hearings unusual.

Shell discovered and owns 61% of the field. Husky owns 12%. The normal practice
would have been for the majority owner to operate the project and to propose the
development plan. But Husky submitted its own plan and asked Alberta's Energy
Resources Conservation Board to choose between the two. That created one of the
most important confrontations in the history of the board.

DEEP EMOTIONS

Kruk says the deep emotions touched by some of the testimony and the guidance
outlined in the decision mean that in the future, major projects need to do much
more than meet the usual requirements of economic value, technical feasibility,
environmental impact and safety. They also have to be acceptable to the
communities affected. ''They have to be politically sustainable over time.''

Kruk argues that this means companies have to consult with communities early in
the planning stages of projects. ''It is a mistake to think a company can design
a project and then PR its way through the local communities. The local
population has to be included in the design of the project.''

This includes helping to decide where to locate plants, pipelines and other
facilities so that the project causes the least disruption of the local
lifestyle. It also means ensuring that local residents get direct benefits, such
as jobs and the normal ''good works'' expected of any well-to-do resident in a
small town.

The clear requirement is that the company provide fair and equitable benefits
for the ''involuntary risk'' to which all neighbors are subjected when a major
industrial facility is built in a rural setting. Kruk feels this was an
important reason for the board's ruling.

Kruk works as a freelance consultant, moving from project to project. He has
been self-employed for the past two years. He became familiar with the ERCB
during more than 15 years of working in public affairs for Imperial Oil and
Shell.

The ERCB issues development licences for all wells, pipelines and processing
plants in the province. In an average year, 12,000 permits are issued but only
40 of those require public hearings. Caroline was one of the longest and largest
cases in the board's history. There were 5,622 pages of transcripts, and the
written submissions and applications made a stack of books and papers well over
a metre tall.

In the past, these regulatory hearings were a forum for the companies involved
to negotiate the most acceptable development path given the technical options,
corporate priorities and economic circumstances. Most of the argument was by
engineers and lawyers.

According to Kruk, the affected communities are now recognized as full
participants. That means they have to be included in the negotiations more fully
than has often been the case in the past. The smart company will recognize this
and consult early and often as a project takes shape. The new pattern of
regulatory approvals depends on the company having a proposal that has been
negotiated with the community and meets many of the residents' priorities.

Kruk says: ''The relationships are the key. The company has to establish by its
actions that it can be trusted to do the right thing outside the light of
hearings and away from the supervision of authorities.''


By the time a development proposal comes before the board, Kruk feels most of
the issues should have been dealt with so there is a minimum of open conflict.
The main point is that companies are entering into long-term relationships with
the local people and communities, and they have to behave like new members of
the community.

If the companies fail, the board's past record of issuing most permits without
the need for a public hearing will come to an end. That would lead to an era of
confrontation and conflict over an ever-widening range of industry activity. In
the end, everyone would lose.

Kruk feels the ERCB has charted a clear path for the industry to avoid that. He
is busy spreading the message to anyone who will listen.

SHELL INVESTIGATES SUNDRE-AREA LEAK

BYLINE: DONALD CAMPBELL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D2

LENGTH: 287 words


Alberta environment and Energy Resources Conservation Board officials were
investigating a leak of deadly sour gas on a pipeline near Sundre Friday.

The pipeline, owned by Shell Canada Ltd, began leaking early Friday, Shell
officials confirmed. They described the break as "a pin-hole sized leak" and
said it occurred in one of two lines crossing the James River, about 10
kilometres northeast of Sundre.

It is not known how much gas escaped from the pipeline.

There were no reports of human or livestock health problems late Friday. Shell
said residents within a two-kilometre radius were immediately advised to stay
indoors and those with potential health risks (such as pregnant women) were
advised to evacuate.

"It is a low-level leak," said Bill McQuitty, manager of Shell's Caroline
complex. "It's been isolated, the lines were blocked and depressurized. We'll
make repairs when we determine the exact location of the leak."

McQuitty added that shifting winds made it difficult to find the leak, since
complaints were first received late Thursday. Staff at Shell and Amoco Canada
Ltd. worked through the night and into Friday before they were able to determine
whose line broke.

Environment officials said they believe "a small amount" of concentrate leaked
into the river. Lee Funke said investigators were trying to determine the amount
and the effects of the leak on the river.

Dennis Overguard, who farms six kilometres north of Sundre, said he was
concerned about the environmental effects of the leak, especially on the river.

He has 300 cows grazing in the area and is also concerned the noxious fumes
could cause some of them to have abortions.

"The stink is severe," he said.

following document:



 UNITED STATES

 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20555-0001

 August 24, 2016

 Mr. Barnes Johnson, Director

 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

 Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery

 Washington, DC 20460

 Dear Mr. Johnson:



 I am responding to your March 16, 2016 letter on the Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking

 (ANPR) regarding Regulatory Improvements for Decommissioning Power Reactors
that was

 issued on November 19, 2015 and follow up telephone call on June 3, 2016.

 After careful consideration of your request to ensure that the public is
assured that the

 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the radiological
decommissioning of

 nuclear facilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and that
the U.S.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will continue to regulate the hazardous
materials at

 nuclear power reactors under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
we have

 determined that incorporating this message into the NRC's current rulemaking on
reactor

 decommissioning may not provide a long-lasting communication. In the rulemaking
process,

 issues are addressed typically as a one-time event in the Federal Register
notice of issuance of

 a final rule.

 In reviewing your request, we believe that a more long term communication for
the public is

 through the NRC's publication, NUREG-1628, "Staff Responses to Frequently Asked
Questions

 Concerning Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Reactors," and via the NRC's public
website at

 its reactor decommissioning Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) page.

 We are in the process of updating NUREG-1628 and our website due to the recent
plant

 shutdowns in 2013 and 2014 of five (5) power reactors. We will include
questions and answers

 on EPA's responsibilities under RCRA as described in the memorandum between the
NRC and

 EPA, dated October 9, 2002, as well as state that the RCRA cleanup and closure
obligations

 are not inconsistent, and can be handled effectively and concurrently, with the
NRC's license

 termination requirements. The present revision of NUREG-1628 contains FAQs on
the

 responsibilities of other regulatory agencies, including EPA, in the
decommissioning process.

 We will be updating our website by this fall and are expecting to have the
revision to

 NUREG-1628 ready for publication by the end of the year.

 B. Johnson - 2 -

 Again, thank you for the letter on the ANPR regarding Regulatory Improvements
for

 Decommissioning Power Reactors. We believe that the NRC's approach to
addressing your

Sloppy paperwork won't do

BYLINE: DONALD CAMPBELL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E1

LENGTH: 387 words


ERCB will penalize firms for inaccurate, incomplete reports

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board, pressured by increased work and
fewer resources, will use financial penalties to prod industry to play a more
informed role in a changing regulatory environment.

"Our position is that we hope we do not have to collect a cent in penalties
because data is submitted error-free so that we don't have to expend manpower to
arrange to have the errors rectified," says Jim Dilay, the ERCB's executive
manager for operations.

Dilay said the board has already processed a record number of well licence
applications and pipeline permits this year despite reductions in staff and
financial resources.

As a result, Dilay told the Petroleum Joint Venture Association Wednesday, more
co-operation is needed from industry if the smaller ERCB is to continue to meet
its growing workload.

"Our staff will decline by 35 to 40 per cent . . . at a time when the ERCB
workload has increased by about 60 per cent," he said.

"We're just asking (companies) to pay more attention to what the requirements
are."

That means applications for the board's scrutiny and approval need to be more
accurate and complete on the first take, he said. And it also means that
industry will have to accept a greater onus for its people understanding
requirements and regulations when it comes to enforcement.

"In future, there will be a simpler application process with a reduced level of
information requirement," he said.

"Reduced data requirements may be replaced with audits with more severe
penalties when companies fail to comply."

The ERCB's budget is expected to decline from $ 20 million in its 1993-94 fiscal
year to $ 15.8 million in 1996-97. Staff is expected to decline from more than
800 to 540 over the same period.

The philosophy of financial penalties may have to be extended to other areas if
the current approach does not work, Dilay said. He cited as an example that
staff will no longer have time to send two or three reminder letters to get a
company's field operations to comply with regulatory violations that do not
threaten the public.

"The ultimate recourse for the board, which it does not take lightly, is its
ability to shut in production until the problems are rectified," he warned.

THE PLAY'S ABOUT WORKPLACE EQUITY: THE POINT'S THE THING

BYLINE: CAROL HOWES

SECTION: BUSINESS; ON THE JOB; Pg. H1

LENGTH: 806 words


T ippy Ohlinger had never acted before, so when a message arrived on her
electronic mail last summer asking her to participate in a new theatre
production she jumped at the opportunity to be on stage.

But the young City of Calgary property appraiser quickly discovered this was
more than a leap into unfamiliar territory - much of it was also forbidden.

"I'm not that outgoing but I came (to rehearsals) a couple of times and it got
to be so much fun I kept coming," she recalls.

Ohlinger had joined The Equitees, a mixed bag of 10 employees from the Energy
Resources Conservation Board, the National Energy Board and the City of Calgary.

Most of them had never acted before and had come from different jobs and
backgrounds. But they had one thing in common: a desire to raise awareness of
diversity in the workplace - talk about things like racism, sexism and all the
other unmentionables.

The interactive theatre production has become one of the more unusual methods
Calgary organizations are using to communicate the message about diversity to
their employees.

Next week, during the City of Calgary's Equity Week, the curtain will rise on
the production for many of the actors' colleagues as well as the public.

"(Discrimination) is a very sensitive subject," says ERCB board member Brian
Bietz. "You don't feel like you yourself have a bias and if you're a white, male
professional you honestly think we've already gone past all this. But there are
650 people who work here and these things do occur.

"It happens because you make assumptions and you act based on those
assumptions," he says, recalling an embarrassing incident when he was introduced
at a company party to a woman whom he thought was a secretary but was actually
the company's senior legal counsel. "I'll challenge anyone to say they haven't
done that."

The theatre production is funded by the ERCB, the NEB, the city and the Alberta
Citizenship and Heritage Secretariat (formerly the Alberta Multiculturalism
Commission). It's intended to raise the level of awareness among employees about
subtle, not-so-subtle and systemic discrimination.

The "actors" collaborated to develop vignettes based on their own or their
colleagues' experiences. Not surprisingly, no matter which organization they
worked for, the issues and problems were the same.

At times the production is humorous.

"It's different, it's dynamic," says Scott Gedak of the engineering branch of
the NEB. "Some of these things are a lot more common than I thought they were."

Ernest Mahadeo, a staff engineer with the ERCB, says he joined the troupe
because he has "a very pronounced interest to the point of enthusiasm for
fairness and equity in the workplace."

He emigrated 25 years ago from Trinidad and has had his share of discrimination.

"I'd like to know one day that everyone in all organizations would be treated
fairly, so if you're a female or you have an accent it doesn't matter. It's what
you do and how well you do it that counts."

Doug Borch, an employment counsellor with Community Job Options, also joined the
troupe, anxious to share the experiences of his disabled clients. In one scene,
Borch interviews job applicants and uses a number of discriminatory and sexist
comments.

"This is really sensitive stuff and it pushes some buttons," he says. "But it
creates an environment for discussion."

ERCB drilling and completion supervisor Sheila Baron, who saw an early
performance by the actors, says watching colleagues act out scenes of racism and
sexism was both disturbing and effective.

"I've been going around for years standing up for my rights," she says. "But I
never realized I was racist at such a deep level."

"We do a lot of things unconsciously, that we don't think about."

The group hired Calgarian Patricia Pardo and Richard Campbell to direct the
production. Both have been involved in interactive theatre, using it to educate.

Campbell says he is keen on the production because it is unusual to see
organizations initiate such a project.

"This is a really powerful process," he says. "We're not professional actors;
we're your co-workers and this all really happens to us.

"And there's an entertainment aspect that you don't get from a lecture or an
overhead."

Paul Gingras, a consultant with the Alberta Citizenship and Heritage
Secretariat, says he hopes other organizations will use the production as a
model for similar programs.

"For some organizations it's a bit of a leap. But once they see it has an effect
that other ways can't, they'll be more likely to try it."

The Equitees will perform for the public at 4:30 p.m. Monday in the Engineered
Air Theatre in the Calgary Centre for Performing Arts. There are also a number
of private performances for employees scheduled for next week.

PRODUCER ISSUES GAS ALARM

BYLINE: DUNCAN THORNE, EDMONTON JOURNAL

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 852 words


Too much gas is being sold to U.S., says oilpatch veteran

Rarely does a natural gas producer accuse government of allowing too much
production.

But then there's Ed Wolf, owner of Stone Petroleums Ltd. of Calgary.

"It's not even a case of being a voice in the wilderness," says Wolf. "It's like
you're a voice down a mine shaft."

Wolf, 71, fears Alberta is pumping its gas to the thirsty U.S. so fast it's
sending its future down the pipe as well.

He recalls the 1971 claim by then-federal energy minister Joe Greene of Canada
having 923 years of oil and 392 years of gas.

Industry figures show Canada's reserves are now down to about eight years for
oil and possibly 10 years for gas, he says.

Wolf says a third of the gas reserves are questionable. About 30 per cent more
is used or lost in production-related activities.

In his view the regulators, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board and
the National Energy Board, have let the decline happen because they are in bed
with the industry.

The ERCB acknowledges reserves have fallen - by its estimates to 7.8 years in
the case of oil and to 13.8 years for gas. But it says producers are constantly
proving up more reserves, if not at the same pace as production.

The consensus of industry and regulators is that, at least with gas, a current
exploration push will bring reserves additions into balance with production.

Wolf contends the big finds are increasingly unusual. After the discovery of two
trillion cubic feet (tcf) at Dunvegan in 1971, it took 18 years to hit a
comparable field, at Caroline.

Two tcf is just six months of Alberta production, he says.

The search for replacement gas is becoming so intense, it's having a disastrous
effect on wildlife, he adds. The industry talks of next exploiting Alberta's
coal-bed methane reserves - a prospect that to him spells environmentally
ruinous exploration and production.

He concentrates his efforts these days on fighting for a change of attitude at
the ERCB and NEB.

He has passed the presidency of Stone to son David Wolf, who is also chairman of
the Small Explorers and Producers Association of Canada.

Stone, with just four employees, is small. But it has a legitimate stake in the
industry, daily producing about 95 barrels of oil and 300,000 cubic feet of gas
as of 1992.

Joe Mercier, founder of Universal Explorations, is among the few oilmen who
express any sympathy for Ed Wolf's views.

But even Mercier, who has been described as sharing some of Wolf's doubts about
gas surpluses, says he's confident Alberta has enough gas in the ground for the
foreseeable future.

Mercier says Wolf is "a loose cannon - and a communist if you talk to some of
the real right-wingers.

"He usually follows his convictions, and he does it before a very hostile
audience."

Mercier acknowledges there's a rush to export gas. But Alberta benefits from an
improving price, which has moved to the $ 2 range from a low of about 70 cents
per thousand cubic feet.

"There are two sides to the question," he says. "We were giving it away too
cheaply at a buck, but at two bucks we're draining a fair bit of money out of
the Americans."

Ian Doig, independent-minded editor of oilpatch magazine Doig's Digest, says
it's wrong to accuse the federal and provincial regulators of being cosy with
the industry. "They are above and beyond question."

The ERCB gets most of its funding from industry and government, in equal
portions. The NEB has no industry money.

The fall in Canadian reserves is undeniable, Doig says. But it's a necessary
result of the mid-1980s deregulation which ended the need for long-term
deliverable reserves - instantly creating a market surplus.

"We've been selling off the inventory."

He released his own study in May - Canadian Natural Gas; where it is and where
exports are going - using figures from the NEB, ERCB and Geological Survey of
Canada.

"All three of them, from different directions, came to the same conclusion,"
Doig says. "There's still a lot of gas to be found in Western Canada."

He says the ERCB has estimated Alberta's "ultimate potential" gas development
seven times since 1955, taking into account the economics and technology of the
times. "And each time they have increased the figure as new information has
become available."

The latest guess is 200 trillion cubic feet, up from the original tally of
60-100 tcf. The estimate for harder-to-get coal-bed methane is 250-390 tcf.

As for Wolf, Doig says: "He's added a dimension to the debate. And it's never a
clear-cut question-and-answer debate."

But Doig adds: "He doesn't have a lot of credence (in the industry) because the
name of the game is to get out there and sell gas."

ERCB gas reserves supervisor Lorne Samson says Alberta's gas play is still
relatively young. "We're saying 36 per cent of our ultimate potential has been
produced as of the end of 1993."

Samson says it's untrue his agency has a bias towards the industry. "I've been
here 30 years and I think the board has a really solid reputation as an
impartial arbitrator."

ALBERTA'S ENERGY STOCKPILE SHRINKS

BYLINE: GORDON JAREMKO

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B11

***(Graphic accompanying story not sent to database)***

Refinery-ready oil reserves erode despite burst of drilling activity

Alberta's oil supplies are slipping, the Energy Resources Conservation Board
reported Friday.

Drilling slumps combined with natural depletion of wells are shrinking reserves
of high-grade, "light" or refinery-ready crude, the provincial government agency
said.

Alberta entered 1993 with six per cent less supplies on hand than a year
earlier. In 1992, oil companies sold 167 million barrels more top-grade oil than
they found.

That left the province with 2.78 billion barrels of known light crude reserves,
or an eight-year supply at current production rates of 337 million barrels
annually.

The ERCB attributed the slippage to prolonged drilling slumps, which have
allowed reserves to deteriorate since the 1986 oil-price collapse led to deep
cuts in industry budgets.

Although exploration drilling to hunt for new oil pools accelerated modestly
last year, the pace was still 27-per-cent slower than the average for the 1980s.

The ERCB said less risky development drilling, to raise production from known
reserves, increased by about one-third last year compared to 1991 and nearly
tied the 1980s average.

While the Geological Survey of Canada as well as the ERCB estimate about four
billion barrels of light oil await discovery by new drilling in Alberta, they
also agree the next generation of pools will be smaller, harder and more
expensive to find.

A recent poll of the top 87 oil companies, by the accounting firm of Arthur
Andersen & Co., found they want prices to rise by about 25 per cent to $ 26 US a
barrel to justify more drilling. The oil firms also predicted prices will take
until 2001 to hit their target.

The industry also let reserves of even costlier "unconventional" crude decline,
rather than revive dormant budgets for developing replacements for the depleting
conventional wells.

Reserves of northeastern Alberta oilsands mining operations slipped 107 million
barrels to 2.7 billion barrels by the end of 1992, when cost-conscious Syncrude
Canada Ltd. and Suncor Inc. did not move to replace their production.

Reserves also slipped among other types of oilsands operations, known as
"in-situ" plants for their method of separating oil from sand with underground
processes.

But the in-situ projects, which cost less than mining complexes, replaced nearly
two-thirds of their 1992 production as firming oil prices rekindled interest in
additional development.

The industry also let its natural-gas reserves drop in 1992, when poor prices
for most of the year combined with a widespread strategy of selling off
surpluses to cut drilling to levels as much as 41 per cent below 1980s averages,
the ERCB reported.

Alberta entered 1993 with gas reserves on hand of 56.6 trillion cubic feet, or a
15-year supply at current production rates.

Unlike oil, gas remains rated as abundant enough for low-cost drilling to
replace reserves readily when new supplies are needed.

Alberta board curtails sales of natural gas to California

BYLINE: CP

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 553 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


   CALGARY (CP) - An Alberta government agency stunned the petroleum industry
Friday by interfering with a $2.1-billion natural gas export deal that had
already won approval from authorities in Ottawa and the United States.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board dealt a setback to the industry's
hard-won progress in easing export restrictions with its decision on shipments
to California by Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., a sales agency for 420 production
companies.

Increase deliveries

The government board denied Pan-Alberta permission to fulfil an agreement to
expand a major contract with Southern California Gas Co. of Los Angeles.

Pan-Alberta sought a permit to extend the contract to the year 2012 and increase
deliveries by 1.3 trillion cubic feet.

The change was approved this summer by the National Energy Board.

But the provincial board agreed to extend the permit only until 2003 and chopped
the proposed jump in deliveries by nearly 60 per cent, down to a much less
lucrative gain of 557 billion cubic feet.

The decision sent officers of the Calgary and Los Angeles firms back to their
drawing boards.

Both sought a quick and favorable ruling as essential to protect Alberta exports
against competition from U.S. dealers.

The ruling still has to be approved by the provincial cabinet, but it
traditionally accepts or rejects Energy Resources Conservation Board
recommendations rather than making modifications.

A Pan-Alberta spokesman said current deliveries to California will continue, but
the decision is a great disappointment which "clearly sends the wrong signal to
potential buyers."

The Calgary company plans further discussions with board and cabinet
representatives on what it calls misunderstandings in gas-reserve estimates and
on board interpretations of overall provincial policy.

The ruling confirms warnings by industry sources that the Alberta and federal
governments have taken sharply different approaches to implementing their 1985
agreement to ease regulations.

The National Energy Board has all but abolished an 81-year tradition of national
restrictions on exports, retaining only a monitoring role and a complaint
procedure in place of formerly tight supply protection for Central Canada.

Under new procedures that led to prompt federal approval of Pan-Alberta's
California sale, eastern consumers can only hold up new exports if they can show
Canadians are being denied comparable contracts.

The National Energy Board's ruling, the first under the liberalized policy,
stressed federal willingness to rely on market forces to generate supplies.

Ottawa's board noted that Pan-Alberta has yet to nail down all the gas required
to fulfil the California agreement, but accepted assurances that the deal will
trigger development.

Special circumstances

In a written statement, board vice-chairman Norm Strom said Alberta still says
companies must prove they have all the gas involved in their deals lined up in
advance.

Only "special circumstances" will lead to exceptions and the board said
Pan-Alberta does not qualify. The board also attributed its decision to
historical policy of limiting the terms of removal permits to 15-year periods.

The board said it will conduct a general review of removal-permit policies over
the next year.

Research and Markets: 5 Critical Hot Spots in the Building Industry in
Asia-Pacific in 2014

LENGTH: 426  words


New Delhi, Jan. 22 -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "5
Critical Hot Spots in the Building Industry in Asia-Pacific in 2014" report to
their offering.



The market outlook focus on five important areas in the building industry that
have the potential for business opportunities for market participants in the
Asia-Pacific region. Driven by government initiatives, property developers are
shifting their business focus on sustainable and resource efficient buildings.
The building industry is challenged by rising resources costs such as energy,
water, and raw materials for building construction. In addition, the changing
global climate is expected to place safety of buildings at risk. This will
likely entail immense business prospects in green buildings, smart buildings,
disaster-shield buildings, solar-powered buildings, and resource conservation.

In 2014, there are five main areas that market participants in Asia-Pacific's
building industry may consider focusing on:

* Green Buildings

* Disaster-shield Buildings

* Smart Buildings

* Resource Conservation

* Solar-powered Buildings

Driven by government initiatives, property developers are shifting their
business focus on sustainable and resource-efficient buildings. Green buildings
are generally designed and built treduce consumptionand reliance on energy,
water, and building construction materials. In smart buildings, the performance
of the building is enhanced, as all components are integrated to work together
with the help of systems, technologies, and tools that will ultimately manage
and minimizeenergy consumption. Solar energy has been generating attention of
late due tthe depletion of non-renewable and polluting natural resources such as
crude oil, natural gas, and coal. Solar energy is being explored as a renewable
and energy-efficient technology that is widely used in green buildings.

The change in weather patterns and frequent natural disasters in Asia-Pacific
will compel market participants tintroduce disaster-shield building concepts.

Resource conservation, which entails the recycling and reuse of industrial
materials and construction/demolition waste for the purpose of new construction,
is gaining popularity. Besides minimizing waste that negatively impacts the
environment, waste materials may be engineered to possess better properties than
conventional building materials.

Tata Power launches 'Waste Management Module'

LENGTH: 266 words

DATELINE: Jamshedpur


Jamshedpur, July 31 -- Tata Power's nationwide energy and resource conservation
movement, 'ClubEnerji', has launched Waste Management Module as a part of its
resource conservation programme.

The resource conservation module lays strong emphasis on saving water, fuel,
paper, and electricity, and has successfully imparted knowledge on fuel
conservation, water management and energy conservation to lakhs of students.

The objective of the waste management module is to educate students about the
repercussions of waste dumping on the environment, and its impact on the quality
of soil, air and the ecosystem as a whole. The module aims to provide a platform
to more than 2 lakh students to share and expand their understanding, thereby,
bringing about a chain-reaction that can significantly reduce generation of
waste and increase efficient waste management in the country.

Speaking on this initiative, Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power,
stated, "Today's youth are tomorrow's decision makers, and it is vital to
mobilise and educate them with the knowledge that will help bring about an
important change. By mobilising the youth with the knowledge to effectively
treat waste, Club Enerji aims to spread the message further to their families
and reach out to the communities at large. The module also encourages students
to form their own mini clubs in their societies to reach out to more citizens."

Caroline field of gas no dreamfor neighbors

BYLINE: (CP)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 311 words

DATELINE: CAROLINE, ALTA.


   CAROLINE, Alta. (CP) - To Maria Hall, "it's going to be horrendous" if more
than 1,500 tradesmen go to work to harvest $10 billion worth of natural gas,
sulphur and chemicals almost in her back yard.

"The woods are going to be crawling. There'll be traffic, noise, accidents,
vandalism and trespassing," she predicts.

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board (AERCM) is reviewing rival bids by
Shell Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Ltd. to process the Caroline field's estimated 2
trillion cubic feet of sour gas and liquids.

The hearings in this community located about 120 kilometres northwest of
Calgary, are expected to take up to three weeks.

Hall is among a minority here who refuse to be impressed by batteries of
experts, glossy reports and lawyers, all claiming that the project will be a
model industrial development.

But while the Concerned Residents Action Group has only 42 names on its
membership list, the rival project promoters are treating it with respect.

Although Hall is a quiet farmer, her allies include affluent Calgarians with
cottages and retirement homes in the area - some of whom are oil industry
professionals.

Another ally is Camp Caroline, an agency of the 51-church Alberta Baptist
Association. The camp includes a motel-size lodge and an indoor swimming pool on
a 120-hectare site, and admitted nearly 30,000 guests from across Alberta last
year.

While refusing to be deflected from its plant site selection, Shell acknowledges
the area residents' concerns by promising to go about the project as quietly as
possible.

Measures would include strict pollution controls, thorough policing of
construction workers and maintenance of a "buffer zone" to tuck the plant behind
a screen of trees and pasture.natural; gas; resources; chemical; Alberta;

July 28 -- India-based Tata Power issued the following news release:

Aims at sensitising more than 2 million citizens nationwide

Students from over 280 schools to collect plastic bottles for recycling

Tata Power's nationwide energy and resource conservation movement, Club Enerji,
has been relentlessly working towards spreading the message of judicious use and
conservation of energy across the country. In its 7th year of success, Club
Enerji today announced the launch of Waste Management Module' as a part of its
Resource Conservation Programme.

The Resource Conservation Module lays strong emphasis on saving water, fuel,
paper, and electricity, and has successfully imparted knowledge on fuel
conservation, water management and energy conservation to lakhs of students.

The objective of the Waste Management module is to educate students about the

This year, to make the module a bigger success, a mass drive will be undertaken
by the students. The students will collect plastic bottles and recycle them into
t-shirts for Club Enerji's 'Energy Champions'.

By educating young students about the ramifications of waste dumping, the module
aims to inspire the young minds to inculcate basic precautionary steps in their
daily lives to combat this problem.

While a lot of initiatives focus on waste reduction, effective waste management
of the existing piles of waste around the world remains a topic of concern. The
Waste Management Module addresses the root cause of the problem - 'how waste is
generated, how it impacts the environment, its long term consequences, and the
small steps that can be taken to curb and treat it effectively'.

Alberta in oil sands deals with Amoco, Syncrude

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 323 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


A $280-million oil sands project could evolve from a tentative deal reached
yesterday between Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. and the Alberta government.

The government, in a separate agreement, also approved a deal with oil sands
mining and upgrading company Syncrude Canada Ltd. that could boost other
northern Alberta oil sands projects.

In the first pact, Alberta Energy Minister Rick Orman approved in principle a
royalty agreement with Amoco for developing the Soars Lake oil sands project in
the Cold Lake region of northeastern Alberta - a project that could produce up
to 8,300 barrels of heavy oil a day.

''Soars Lake is starting on a phased-in process that Amoco believes will take
the project into commercial production,'' Norm MacMurchy, Alberta assistant
deputy minister of sustainable energy development, said yesterday. ''It's the
first phase of a large commercial development.''

Amoco has applied to the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board for
commercial development of the Soars Lake lease. Initially, the company plans to
operate 59 heavy oil wells on the property, stepping up to a 220 wells over the
project's expected 15-year life span.

Under the proposed agreement with the Alberta government, Amoco will pay
royalties consisting of 5% of gross production until project payout, after that
increasing to the higher of 5% of gross production or 30% of net revenue.

The royalty agreement removes an element of fiscal uncertainty that was holding
back the project, said Orman's executive assistant.

While completely separate from the Amoco agreement, the Syncrude deal could
stimulate development of other oil sands projects further north in the province
(closer to Fort McMurray where Syncrude is based), he said.

It will allow Syncrude to purchase bitumen (a heavy, tar-like substance) from
other projects for upgrading into synthetic crude oil at the Syncrude plant.

'Ecofreaks' didn't pressure ERCB into decision

SECTION: LETTER; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 241 words


Re "Environmentalists cheer," Herald, Sept. 9, the decision by the ERCB to
reject Amoco Canada's bid to drill for gas in the Whaleback region of southwest
Alberta.

The decision was made by the Energy Resources Conservation Board. The ERCB is a
provincial government-appointed agency whose mandate is to help chart and manage
the future development of Alberta's non-renewable resources.

As an environmentalist who works in a climate of mutual co-operation with
companies such as Amoco to insure that any resource development is done with
regard for the future well-being of all Albertans, I resent any implication that
pressure from special interest groups ie., ecofreaks, resulted in the ERCB
decision.

The ERCB decision was based on technical deficiencies in the Amoco Plan,
deficiencies that I am sure Amoco will remedy.

The ERCB decision is not a condemnation of the Special Places 2000 Concept --
which is in my opinion a realistic approach that balances environmental
protection, resource development and the recreational needs of all Albertans --
but instead confirmation that the public consultation process works.

Please don't paint all environmentalists as anti-development.

Most environmentalists work hard to ensure that any resource development is done
in such a way as to balance the needs of industry and the environment, for the
benefit of all Albertans now and in the future.

Leo D. Puerzer,

Calgary.

HEARING CALLED INTO KANANASKIS DRILLING

BYLINE: HERALD STAFF

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 115 words


The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has called for a hearing to
examine an application by Husky Oil Ltd. to drill five test wells in Kananaskis
Country west of Calgary.

Husky officials said the $ 25-million plan to test a potentially large oil
discovery could be delayed a full year due to the hearing, set for Jan. 11. A
pre-hearing meeting to examine arguments is scheduled for Dec. 3.

The oil discovery, made last winter by Husky and its partner Rigel Energy Corp.
on Moose Mountain, has attracted the attention of environmentalists because it
sits inside Kananaskis Country, an area designated for conservation, recreation,
forestry and petroleum use.

Regulator's fears fail to stop gas-plant boom

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 397 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  A mini-boom in construction of Alberta gas-processing plants, fueled by
soaring U.S. demand for Canadian natural gas, has sparked public concern about
environmental pollution.

The building binge is also prompting fears that gas-plant proliferation will cut
into agricultural and recreational land bases, said Eric Moeller, gas processing
supervisor at the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board, the provincial
body responsible for regulating gas plant development.

But gas processors doubt the AERCB's vow to clamp down on unnecessary plant
proliferation will put a lid on construction.

In a bullish mid-year forecast, Calgary-based Oilweek magazine predicted 41 new
plant and plant expansion projects will be completed during 1989, at a total
capital cost of $253.5 million.

Another 10 projects, collectively worth more than $160 million, are slated for
completion in 1990.

Further in the future looms Shell Canada Ltd.'s sour-gas megaproject. The
company recently applied to the AERCB for permission to build a $700-million gas
processing plant in the Caroline sour-gas field in central Alberta.

''There's increasing pressure to catch up with the surge in demand for gas by
the U.S. export market,'' Don Rigby, president of the Canadian Gas Processors
Association, said in an interview.

But according to the AERCB, there are already 622 gas plants in Alberta, nearly
double the 362 plants at the start of the decade.

''Today's overall capacity . . . representing 200% of actual production, is far
more than appears to be necessary to meet maximum day requirements or prudent
planning of future developments,'' board member F. J. Mink said recently.

At least one gas producer hopes to benefit from the AERCB's clampdown on
gas-plant construction.

Husky Oil Ltd. said it will file a competing proposal tomorrow to process sour
gas from the huge Caroline field. The plan involves a $500-million expansion of
an existing Husky gas plant and expansion of a smaller plant operated by Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd.

At the inevitable AERCB hearing, Shell is expected to counter by arguing its
plant would eventually process ultra-sour gas from the nearby Bearberry field,
in addition to the Caroline gas. There's probably no way the Bearberry gas - 90%
deadly hydrogen sulphide - can safely be piped more than a few kilometres.

Tata Power Club Enerji saves 17.25 million units of electricity

LENGTH: 270 words

DATELINE: Jamshedpur


Jamshedpur, June 16 -- Tata Power's nationwide resource and energy conservation
movement Club Enerji, has been spreading awareness about resource conservation
across the country, through its theme of national building. In line with this,
the Club Enerji movement has successfully achieved a significant milestone of
saving 17.25 million units of electricity by sensitising more than 12.8 million
citizens across 11 locations including Jamshedpur and Ranchi. This saving is
equivalent to saving 17000 tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to the amount of
energy.

Since its inception in 2007, Club Enerji has been active in over 500 schools and
has created 1337 Mini Clubs all over India. The club has now created more than
195216 Energy Champions and 241917 Energy Ambassadors among school students. In
2015-16, Club Enerji has saved over 2.5 million units and sensitised close to
3.5 million citizens

Speaking on the initiative, Anil Sardana, CEO & managing director, Tata Power,
said, "We are happy and proud to reach this significant milestone in driving the
message of energy conservation across the country. Tata Power has always been
committed to the cause of saving energy and propagated resource conservation
practices since its inception .I take this opportunity to thank all the
students, schools and our Club Enerji team for supporting Tata Power in its
efforts to save our planet and light up lives for the years to come."

Council launches efforts aimed at helping local farmers, ranchers

BYLINE: Ethan Schowalter-Hay, The Observer, La Grande, Ore.

Oct. 4--Northeast Oregon is seeing some interesting explorations into
agricultural technology and procedure that could have beneficial impacts on area
farmers and ranchers.

The Eagle Cap Resource Conservation and Development Council is a non-profit
organization focused on natural resource conservation and community development
in Baker, Union and Wallowa counties.

RC&D districts were established by Congress in 1962 "to promote conservation,
improve land use, develop natural resources and enhance social, economic and
environmental conditions in primarily rural areas of the U.S.," according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service, which
administers the program.

While ECRCD is not yet authorized (see sidebar), its steering committee --
comprised of representatives of NRCS, the Forest Service, soil and water
conservation districts, the Oregon Department of Forestry, extension services
and other agencies and community members -- is moving ahead with diverse
projects.

Cindy Whitlock has been the ECRCD coordinator for nearly two years. She said
that much of the district's energy is currently devoted to three ambitious
efforts with much potential bearing on local agriculture.

In response to rising energy costs and the uncertain financial climate, ECRCD is
offering assistance to local farmers and ranchers interested in bolstering the
energy efficiency of their operations, through its Agricultural Energy
Efficiency Program.

"Because with the price of gas, that's really going to be important to
(producers)," said Whitlock.

Mike Burton, district conservationist at the NRCS La Grande office, and Lisa
Cron, director of the Union County Soil and Water Conservation District, are
coordinating the AEEP program for ECRCD.

"The goal is to get (producers) more efficient systems," Cron said.

ECRCD is providing interested producers with an outline for proceeding in the
AEEP program. Following initial consultations, the firm EnSave would conduct an
energy audit on the operation in question.

After receiving the results, the producer could then decide whether or not to
seek grants for projects maximizing energy efficiency.

Burton said, "We kind of diagnose the opportunity, and the RC&D is there to help
coordinate getting funding."

There are a number of funding sources the ECRCD consultants can direct producers
to, from USDA Rural Development to the Oregon Department of Energy. Some of
these have set deadlines for submitting grant applications; others operate on a
rolling schedule.

This maiden year, ECRCD is aiming for three or four producers to participate.

"With it being our first time, we're setting our goals a little lower," Cron
explained.

On his own, local farmer Phil Hassinger has already undergone an efficiency
upgrade to his operation off Booth Lane. Now he's a resource for ECRCD and
interested peers.

"We've been kind of tapping Phil's brain," Burton said.

Another project gathering momentum is the installation of a Global Positioning
System base station in Wallowa County.

This initiative is a partnership between ECRCD and the Oregon Department of
Transportation.

"The hand-held recreational GPS units most of us own these days are accurate to
300 feet, which is usually accurate enough for those of us out playing in the
woods or looking for directions to our friend's house," said Ron Singh, chief of
surveys and geometronics manager for ODOT at a July meeting in Wallowa County.

"However, if you are out surveying or doing precision farming, that's just not
close enough. Every foot in precision farming is money. Money in terms of too
much or too little pesticide or fertilizer applied, gallons of diesel used to
run equipment and bales or bushels yielded from cropland."

Base stations provide reference points to compensate for the GPS locational
offset, and could have applications well beyond farming.

Joe Zuger of the Wallowa County Soil & Water Conservation District, one of the
coordinators of the project along with Tom Smith of Wallowa County NRCS, said
such stations are well distributed in western Oregon, much more patchily so east
of the Cascades. A Wallowa County system could coordinate with others in
Pendleton and La Grande (at the rest area just north of the mouth of Ladd
Canyon) for increased triangulation.

Zuger said ECRCD is still investigating funding -- a base station unit typically
costs some $20,000 -- and the best method to transmit signals from the base
station to ODOT and then to individual GPS receivers.

Finally, ECRCD is beginning an investigation of a grass bank for ranchers in
Baker County, and potentially elsewhere within the district. This program would
provide forage for producers whose grazing allotments or pasture land have
burned in a wildfire.

To allow such range to adequately recover, the grass bank program would open
other grounds for cattle. Such efforts are also meant to promote sustainable
grazing practices.

In addition, ECRCD has connected a local group of producers and other
individuals interested in creating a biodiesel co-op with industry professionals
and other such coalitions elsewhere in Oregon.

 A few years ago, staff at Boulder's Center for ReSource Conservation began
noticing that hundreds of pounds of lumber, mostly pulled from home renovation
projects, were ending up in landfills.



 The reason? The lumber was full of nails.

 Last year, the center ramped up its denailing initiative,  in which volunteers
carefully   remove nails from framing lumber, planks and studs, and diverted 3.8
million pounds of lumber and other building materials from landfills.

 Once it's been denailed, the high-quality lumber is available to the public for
a fraction of the cost of new lumber. Donated lumber and building materials are
also eligible for a tax deduction.

 That principle -- helping people save money and precious resources at the same
time -- has been one of the center's core tenets  since it was founded in 1976.

 "When you can help people conserve resources, you can help them save money,"
said Neal Lurie, president of the Center for ReSource Conservation. "If you can
make it economically compelling, then people will take action."

 To celebrate 40 years of resource conversation, the center is hosting a "
Heroes & Hope" event at Boulder's eTown Hall on Wednesday. The event will take a
look back at how the environmental movement has changed over the years and a
look forward at what's to come. The celebration will also honor several
"conservation superheroes."

 A group of people looking for ways to reduce dependance on non-renewable
resources founded the Center for ReSource Conservation, formerly the Boulder
Energy Conservation Center, in response to the 1973 oil crisis, according to
Lurie.

 "There were long lines at the pump, energy prices were soaring and here in
Colorado, Gov. (Richard) Lamm was looking at different community organizations
to partner with to help get energy conservation technology out into the
community," he said.

 In the early days, the center was primarily focused on educating homeowners
about solar heating technologies.

 Water conservation was also an  important initiative in the center's early work
and would go on to become  one of the organization's largest components -- last
year, the center helped conserve more than 160 million gallons of water.

 Over time, the center also realized that reducing waste was an effective way to
conserve resources. The center launched ReSource, its reclaimed materials
program, in 1996. Today, ReSource is co-located with  Eco-Cycle's Center for
Hard-to-Recycle Materials at 6400 Arapahoe Ave.

 "A lot of people were renovating their kitchens or bathrooms and they had these
perfectly good counters or cabinets, but they didn't know what to do with them,"
Lurie said. "In the past, people were simply throwing them away and that made us
crazy."

 In partnership with an array of water utilities, the center also works with
homeowners to make sure they're not overwatering their lawns and gardens.

 Another fast-growing program is "Garden in a Box," which helps make it easy for
homeowners to xeriscape their yards.

 Each "garden" contains roughly 20 low-water plants, step-by-step instructions
and a plant-by-number design. The gardens were so popular that they sold out in
the spring and again this fall, when the center added a second distribution to
try to meet demand.

 "We're able to provide a range of low-water gardens and make it really easy for
people so that once they remove their grasses, they know exactly what to do,"
Lurie said. "That is key, because in 2016 you can't just be preaching to the
choir from an environmental perspective. You have to look at how we can connect
with Main Street America. All our programs revolve around making it really,
really easy for customers to conserve."

 Looking ahead, the center is trying to better serve low-income families with
its new Conservation For All program, which helps bring high-efficiency toilets,
solar panels and LED light bulbs to low-income housing facilities.

 "There's not a whole lot we can do about the cost of housing in Colorado, but
there is a significant amount we can do to help lower the total cost of housing,
which includes utility bills," Lurie said. "Lots of people overlook the fact
that electricity bills, water bills can add up to hundreds or thousands of
dollars over the course of a year."

 The center also helped test what is now  EnergySmart, the  program that helps
Boulder County  homes and businesses become more efficient.

 "The Center for ReSource Conservation is a powerhouse nonprofit in our
community," said Susie Strife, sustainability coordinator for Boulder County.
"Not only in energy conservation but in water conservation we've seen a true
commitment and professionalism and service to our community, and I think it's
absolutely incredible."

FARMERS CITE BIAS IN APPEAL

BYLINE: ANDY MARSHALL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 331 words


citing bias -- have asked the province to take pollution disputes between them
and the petroleum industry out of the hands of the Energy Resources Conservation
Board.

The 35,000-member Alberta Cattle Commission has backed a resolution calling for
the ERCB's removal from any responsibility for investigating petroleum industry
issues -- suggesting Alberta Environment fill the role the board has assumed for
decades.

Commission delegate Doug Jones, a Didsbury-area rancher, says having the ERCB
intercede in disputes between the petroleum industry and ranchers is like a fox
guarding the hen house. "The ERCB is captive to the industry."

The powerful energy industry watchdog is downplaying this latest evidence of
rancher disenchantment, but it's also anxious to stop discontent.

"We like to think we have good dialogue with the agricultural industry and we're
always open to more," says ERCB co-chairman Frank Mink.

These matters relate to underground contamination from oil well waste and to
emissions and flaring from gas plants, which some ranchers are convinced affect
the health of humans and cattle.

The province's new package of green laws, the Alberta Environmental Protection
and Enhancement Act which is expected to be enacted before spring, will
reinforce the ERCB's involvement in environmental issues, according to Mink.

Gary Webster, manager of environment and health with the Canadian Association of
Petroleum Producers, is promising more efforts this year to improve
communication with landowners.

But Jones warns any solution to the ranchers' complaints will involve a lot more
than improved dialogue. "If they think that, then we've really got problems."

The tense relations between agricultural interests and the oilpatch is reflected
in the still-unresolved refusal by Provost area farmer Cy Skinner to accept
additional oil wells on his property because of his concerns about underground
and air pollution from existing operations.

Whaleback ruling stands: Klein

BYLINE: Peter Morton

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg.

LENGTH: 368 words

DATELINE: Ottawa, Ont.


The Alberta cabinet has no intention of overturning a controversial decision by
the province's energy agency to deny Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd. permission
to drill in an ecologically sensitive area, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said
yesterday.

Calgary-based Amoco Canada, a subsidiary of Amoco Corp. of Chicago, failed to
convince the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board it could launch its
plan for a $25-million exploration program in the Whaleback region of the
Alberta Foothills southwest of Calgary.

''My understanding is - and I'm getting this second hand - the presentation (by
Amoco Canada) was not very good,'' Klein said.

Amoco Canada spokesman Dan Kane said one of its options is to appeal to the
Alberta cabinet to overturn the decision. It can also re-apply to the ERCB or
drop the entire project.

''We're still evaluating the decision,'' Kane said yesterday.

ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS

During the 10-day hearing last May, Amoco Canada promised to use sophisticated
drilling techniques, reducing the number of conventional wells to five from 20,
in a bid to convince the ERCB it could tap the massive natural gas reservoir
thought to be about 1.2 trillion cubic feet, roughly 20% of annual Canadian
production.

Amoco Canada also used economic arguments, saying that developing the massive
reservoir would bring in $2 billion in new revenue, generate 1,500 jobs and add
about 2% to Alberta's existing gas reserves.

But the ERCB said that Amoco Canada did not prove it could drill and still meet
land-use regulations. Environmental groups had argued the area should be
off-limits to oil and natural gas companies because of the area's unique
ecological features.

Klein said the ERCB made a mistake in its ruling by referring to a proposed
provincial land-use study, called Special Places 2000, that would try to develop
new land-use regulations in the Alberta Rockies and Foothills.

''Special Places 2000 should never have entered into it,'' said Klein, adding it
was still a working paper with no official status.

The ERCB said it would be inappropriate to approve an exploration program in an
area that may end up being off-limits for drilling.

'Fracking' lawsuit spurs legal worries in oil patch

BYLINE: JEFF GRAY and NATHAN VANDERKLIPPE

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; NATURAL GAS / DRILLING; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 781 words

DATELINE: TORONTO and CALGARY


A controversial method of drilling for natural gas that has revolutionized the
industry is confronting a growing backlash across North America, and the
fast-spreading technique faces a legal test in Canada's oil and gas heartland.

In the latest sign that pressure against the practice, known as "fracking," is
mounting, a Southern Alberta woman filed a $33-million lawsuit alleging that
nearby drilling by Encana Corp. is responsible for contaminating her water with
enough methane that it can be lit on fire.

The allegations have not been proven in court. The case comes just weeks after
Quebec put all fracking projects - short for fracturing - on hold while it
studies the environmental effects.

Fracturing involves injecting substances below ground to break up rock
formations and force up natural gas. Often companies use large volumes of sand,
water and chemicals or gases like nitrogen.

Controversy over its effects, including the alleged contamination of
groundwater, has raged in the United States.

Last week, Jessica Ernst, 54, a landowner near Rosebud, Alta. - about 120
kilometres northeast of Calgary - filed a lawsuit against EnCana, the province
and the province's energy regulator.

Ms. Ernst, who has worked as an environmental consultant to the oil and gas
industry, accuses Encana in her statement of claim of engaging in a  risky and
experimental drilling program" to extract shallow coal-bed methane from several
wells near her property in the Rosebud area.

The lawsuit, which she launched after waging a local campaign against fracking,
also targets the provincial government and the province's Energy Resources
Conservation Board.

She accuses the board of failing to police the industry since her water starting
irritating her skin in 2004.

"I'm not the only one. There are many others that this has happened to, and my
story is not unique," Ms. Ernst said in an interview from New York, where she is
taking part in a panel discussion on fracking being held at the United Nations.

The fracturing used to extract coal-bed methane is technically different from
methods employed in extraction of shale gas, which has generated major
controversy around the globe. But the alleged impacts are largely the same, as
are the questions surrounding how industry taps novel energy sources.

Encana spokesman Alan Boras defended the company's natural gas production,
saying it is safe and that there are "numerous precautions put in place that
ensure that we do not interact or contaminate groundwater."

He said homes around Rosebud regularly encounter natural gas in water wells
because they have been driven into shallow coal seams.

A spokeswoman for the Energy Resources Conservation Board declined to comment,
saying the matter was before the courts. Alberta Environment also declined to
comment on the lawsuit.

One Toronto environmental lawyer says there are other legal cases like Ms.
Ernst's that could surface soon against others in the industry. Dianne Saxe, who
is not involved with Ms. Ernst's lawsuit, says she has been approached on a
similar case in Alberta, and there are other disputes.

The industry has long argued that fracking is safe - and that the chief problem
facing companies is their operations in areas where people are unfamiliar with
drilling.

"As a result, there is a public angst about what is actually potentially going
to happen when companies go in," said Mike Dawson, the president of the Canadian
Society for Unconventional Gas, an industry-supported group.

In northeastern British Columbia, for example, the rise in water-intensive
fracking has coincided with a drought period.

Mike Bernier, the mayor of Dawson Creek, B.C., called his town's water supply
"very fragile."

"One of the concerns is if the oil and gas industry goes out there and takes too
much water before it gets to the city." That has made for difficult choices.

"We've done very well with the oil and gas sector, and we're promoting it," Mr.
Bernier said. "If we say, don't use the water, there's no more oil and gas. So
it's a circle you have to balance very carefully."

Releasing natural gas trapped in rock

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a controversial technique used to extract
natural gas hidden in shale rock. Concerns over the process include chemical
contamination and heavy water usage.

1.  Vertical shaft drilled down to shale layer

2.  Well bore drilled horizontally into shale

3.  Water, sand and chemicals are pumped down well at high pressure

4.  Fracking: Water pressure fractures shale. Sand keeps fractures open as gas
expands into well bore

5.  Gas pumped to surface

Is it worth it to replace my energy-inefficient furnace?

BYLINE: Jason Love For the Camera

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 475 words


Q:  How do I know when it's time to fix or replace my furnace?

A:  This question is on many people's minds this time of year. Brad Queen, the
Center for Resource Conservation's Energy Director, recently replaced his aging,
inefficient model. I asked what his motivations were, "Getting the full tax
credit and the Recharge Colorado rebate before it was gone. My old furnace was
23 years old and 80 percent efficient, my new one is 95 percent efficient".



 I would recommend looking at three factors that can help you decide if it is
time to replace your furnace:

 Age and safety

 Fuel prices

 Incentives

 How old is your furnace? The EnergyStar Web site recommends considering
replacing your furnace if it is more than 15 years old. At this age, safety
could be a concern. An old furnace could be corroded or have cracks resulting in
the release of harmful carbon-monoxide gases. You will want to have this tested
and examined by a trained contractor. The Center for ReSource Conservation (www.
conservationcenter.org) has a list of our business members who are trained
contractors. The Boulder Green Building Guild and Recharge Colorado are other
excellent resources. In addition to safety concerns, older models are typically
far more inefficient than furnaces available today.

 Fuel prices in recent years have fluctuated over time, but it is almost a
guarantee they are not going down. Take a look at your current utility bill, has
your gas bill been on the rise? If you currently have an 80 percent efficient
furnace and you replaced it with a 95 percnet gas furnace, you can see a
potential 15 percent increase in energy efficiency (this is if your air ducts
are working properly). You should also consider the electrical efficiency of
your new blower motor. A more efficient motor can pay for itself with
electricity savings over its life.

 Increasing insulation to recommended levels, completing air sealing in your
home can reduce the size of the furnace you will need. Adding a programmable
thermostat can save you even more money. It is important to look at these before
changing your furnace. You can get assistance on these from Boulder County's new
EnergySmart service 303-544-1000 or signup@popboulder.com)

 The last factor you should consider is incentives. There are some good
incentives available first-come first-serve from Xcel Energy, Recharge Colorado,
and federal tax credits. You may also be able to get a microloan or use an
Energy Star mortgage to finance your furnace replacement.

Tata Power's Club Enerji creates a new milestone - saves 14.2MUs through energy
conservation efforts

LENGTH: 792  words

DATELINE: Mumbai, Maharashtra


Tata Sons has issued the following news release:

Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide movement, announced today that the company
is strengthening its programme by committing towards nation building. The
programme aims to do this by broadening the horizons and introducing various
critical facets that will widen the scope of the existing module and make it
expansive (deeper penetration in India and internationally). It is looking to
contribute towards nation building by creating responsible citizens who will
focus not only on conserving energy and natural resources (like fossil
fuel-coal, oil, gas, water, managing waste, afforestation) but also imbibe civic
and moral values. This year Club Enerji is also undertaking this unique
initiative of urging children to pledge to become better citizens.

In a nutshell the approach has been broad-based to:
Energy and National Resource Conservation plus Conservation of Moral & Civic
values = Nation Building through responsible citizens

Over the years, Tata Power Club Enerji programme has been relentlessly working
towards spreading the message of judicious use and conservation of energy across
the country. Through its continuous efforts, Club Enerji has reached a momentous
milestone by successfully saving 14.2MUs of electricity and sensitizing
9.3million citizens across the country and now it plans to take it to the next
level of nation building. This will be done through its efforts towards energy
and resource conservation including conservation of fossils fuels (coal, oil,
gas) and other natural resources and protecting the forest cover and
biodiversity and moral and civic values like encouraging students to be the
change they want to see, staying away from bad habits, being safe and ensuring
others' safety, imbibing honesty and good manners and having no gender bias.
This year, Club Enerji will also be looking at forging various partnerships to
widen the reach and penetration of the programme.

Speaking on the initiative, Anil Sardana, managing director and chief executive
officer, Tata Power, said, "As part of our 100 year celebration, we are
determined to strengthen our programme and encourage children of today to become
responsible citizens of tomorrow. The aim of the programme is to have children
realise their future role as nation builders by becoming good civic citizens,
while working towards good practices for conservation of energy and national
resources and above all learn to conserve moral values."

"Saving close to 14.2MUs of electricity till date is a significant milestone
with our focused approach on spreading the message of energy conservation across
the country. We are thankful to all the students and mentors at schools for
supporting us in our efforts to help save our planet. We are determined to
continue with our programme and sensitise the citizens of tomorrow the dire need
of being moral and value based in growing as responsible citizens and promoting
energy and resource conservation. At Tata Power, we are committed to
lighting-up-lives for the years to come", Mr. Sardana further added.

The Club Enerji initiative has been contributing extensively towards a brighter
and greener tomorrow by undertaking several successful initiatives. The savings
of 14.2MUs of electricity is equivalent to saving 14,200 tonnes of CO2 and is
enough to light up over 6,943 houses for a year. The initiative has further
sensitized approximately 9.3million citizens cross 11 locations in Mumbai,
Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bengaluru, Lonavala, Maithon, Belgaum,
Jamshedpur and Ranchi.

Today, Club Enerji has become a holistic movement to save energy and natural
resources. It has reached out to over 480 schools in India with a total of
1,59,103 energy champions, and 2,04,719 energy ambassadors. Club Enerji also
encourages students to form their own mini clubs in their schools and societies
to reach out to more citizens. In 2014 alone, 1250 mini clubs were formed across
the country. Members of the mini clubs regularly undertake rallies, street
plays, cyclothons, exhibitions and batti bandhs to sensitise as many people as
possible on energy conservation.

Tata Power's Club Enerji has won numerous accolades and has been recognised as a
best practice in forums like Learning Mission by the Tata group. A case study
has also been done by IIM Ahmedabad on the programme. Further, it has also won
the gold at the ABCI awards in the category 'best communication material' and
bronze for its resource conservation module; Asia Pacific Enterprise Leadership
Awards (APELA), Singapore, has conferred 'APELA 2012' - Eco Advocate Award' to
Club Enerji.

DATELINE: EDMONTON, Alberta


   EDMONTON (CP) - The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has given the
green light to Suncor Inc. to go ahead with a $443 million, 25,000 barrel a day
oil sands development near Cold Lake, in northeastern Alberta.

Work is to begin early next year on the first phase of the four-phase project.
Phase 1 is expected to cost $113.5 million and should be in production by
mid-1986.

Pat Vickers, public affairs manager for the Suncor resources group, said the
initial development will have a capacity to produce 5,000 barrels a day of heavy
oil.

The project is expected to create 300 construction jobs and 77 permanent
operating positions.

A total of 110 wells are to be drilled for the first phase, which will also
include a central operation with water treatment, steam generation and
production treatment plants.

New ethane rules clear way for Alberta plastics

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 3, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 575 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  Nova Corp. and Dow Chemical Canada Inc. will proceed with nearly $3 billion
worth of new petrochemicals projects in Alberta, following the unveiling of a
new provincial policy on ethane, the industry's key raw material.

The long-awaited policy, announced Friday by provincial Energy Minister Neil
Webber, clears the way for a $2-billion expansion of Nova's existing
petrochemical and plastics developments at Joffre, Alta., and for an
$800-million plastics and chemicals plant that Dow is building near Edmonton.

Nova had refused to proceed with the Joffre expansion unless the province
guaranteed a supply of ethane at a sufficiently low price. This position placed
Nova in a bitter conflict with Alberta's gas producers, who wanted the right to
extract ethane from natural gas and sell it at market prices.

Dow, for its part, threatened to cancel the Edmonton development if Nova
received preferential treatment from the Alberta government.

Now both petrochemicals companies seem satisfied.

''This is a compromise we can work with,'' Nova Chairman Bob Blair said.

''We have every intention of (proceeding with the Joffre project),'' Blair said.
''We've approached every ethane owner. Negotiations have started.''

He predicted that construction of the new chain of plastics plants will begin
next year, and that the development will come on stream in 1992.

Dow's plant may be completed even sooner. ''We are already building and will
continue to work,'' Dow spokesman Leslie Beard said. ''This is very
satisfactory, very positive for the industry.''

Webber's ethane policy, unveiled after five months of deliberation, adopts
essentially all the recommendations of Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation
Board, a respected quasi-judiciary body whose May report on the province's
ethane supply provoked an angry response from Nova.

The province has grandfathered a system of ''straddle plants'' that extract
ethane from Alberta's main gas pipelines and supply Nova's two existing
petrochemical complexes at Joffre. However, a streamlined approval process for
new ''field plants'' has been introduced, that would allow gas producers to
extract more ethane at the wellhead.

Field plants enable gas producers to market their own ethane, auctioning it to
the highest bidder, including energy companies using ethane for enhanced oil
recovery as well as petrochemical companies. Nova had pushed hard for
perpetuation of the straddle plant system, arguing it is the only means of
providing Alberta's petrochemicals industry with a secure supply of reasonably
priced feedstock.

Webber has also adopted a key ERCB recommendation to deregulate the ethane
market, allowing ethane prices to be determined by supply and demand.

''We are allowing the marketplace to work for all future petrochemical
developments in Alberta,'' he said. In future, even the price of ethane from the
straddle plants will be determined by direct negotiations with gas producers
instead of being set by the government.

Nova has gained some significant concessions. For instance, the threshold volume
of ethane that the gas producers are required to supply to the straddle plants
has been raised more than 10% from the threshold the ERCB recommended in May. In
addition, that threshold will remain in effect for as long as Nova's existing
Joffre plants demonstrate they can use the feedstock supply on a sustained
basis.

Ottawa has no place in review of OSLO oil sands development

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 22, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 1208 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  In September, 1960, the Alberta Oil & Gas Conservation Board - now the Energy
Resources Conservation Board - refused to grant a license for the first-ever
commercial-scale oil sands mining and synthetic crude production project.

The regulators had an array of doubts about the economic and technical
feasibility of the 31,000 barrel-a-day plant. They questioned the ability of the
proponent, Great Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., to finance the undertaking. Intimately
bound up in the decision were fundamental concerns about environmental
protection and resource conservation.

The board gave GCOS two years to whip the project into shape with the
stipulations, among others, that it rethink its handling of waste water from the
plant, and that it process to recover most of the 300 tons a day of sulphur it
proposed to vent into the atmosphere as sulphur dioxide.

CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS

When the plant was approved, in 1962, sulphur recovery of 80% and a new
engineering approach to tailings ponds had been incorporated - both at standards
well ahead of the times. And the technology for the project offered the highest
available efficiency for oil recovery from the sands.

Thirty years before balancing economic and environmental concerns had become
what federal Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard calls ''the greatest challenge
of our times,'' Alberta's energy regulators were practising sustainable
development on Bouchard's own terms, namely: ''to maintain and enhance the
quality of life for Canadians and others around the world while dramatically
reversing the impact of our activities on the environment.''

This said, one wonders what Bouchard hopes to achieve for the environment with
the agreement, announced last week, that the environmental review of the OSLO
oil sands project, this year, will be done jointly by the federal and Alberta
governments through the Energy Resources Conservation Board.

It's ludicrous to argue that the ERCB, with its long record of tough
environmental impact assessments, couldn't get the job done on its own, with the
federal government as an intervener if that made Ottawa feel better.

Three current energy board members will join a five-person OSLO review panel,
the other two members to be appointed with the approval of both governments.

Alberta's consent to the concept of a joint federal-provincial hearing on OLSO
held by a bastardized ERCB represents a change in attitude on the subject of
energy jurisdiction.

Ironic, isn't it, that Premier Don Getty, who can't get his own nominee backed
by the voters of Alberta into the Senate of Canada, is allowing Ottawa to get a
finger onto the appointment of members of his energy agency.

What Bouchard has achieved, constitutionally and politically, is to get Alberta
to agree to a major federal incursion into an area of jealously guarded
provincial jurisdiction without producing a shred of evidence that the federal
government has an iota of anything to contribute to the OSLO review.

Although ownership and control of resources falls within provincial
jurisdiction, Bouchard has used federal authority over interprovincial air
quality and waterways, and his responsibility to aboriginal communities, as a
lever to broaden federal jurisdiction over oil and gas production.

The alternative, to be sure, was a separate federal review of the OLSO project,
a threat which must have assisted in gaining Alberta's acquiescence.

It is certain that the project proponent, a consortium of oil companies lead by
Esso Resources Canada Ltd., much preferred the arrangement to a separate federal
review. In the past, when Ottawa and Alberta have had fights over oil and gas
jurisdiction, the only sure loser was the corporate sector.

Alberta's environmentalists will also welcome the move. They have never been
happy with the ERCB's role as an environmental regulator. They disagree with
many ERCB decisions, such as those allowing natural gas production in sensitive
areas of the Rocky Mountain foothills.

DUAL MANDATE

The energy board has a dual mandate; on one side, it must protect resources and
require development to be technically sound in all aspects, including
environment. On the other side, it must ensure that, for economic benefit,
Alberta's energy resources are developed.

That sounds like the only regulatory body in Canada which is charged with the
now-fashionable mandate of sustainable development. Alberta's mainstream
environmentalists don't see it that way, however. They regard the split mandate
as conflicting, if not downright schizophrenic.

Meanwhile, the controversy over government-promoted pulp mill expansion in
northern Alberta has brought the Getty government's sense of responsibility for
the environment into question. All things considered, Alberta's mainstream
environmentalists are going to welcome with open arms federal intervention into
issues like oil sands development.


The OSLO environmental review agreement may indicate what has been rumored for
months now, that the Getty government is deeply divided on issues of
environmental management, and that Environment Minister Ralph Klein is emerging
from the scrap as the new powerhouse in resource development.

The pulp mill expansion fiasco, which has seen the government's grandiose scheme
for economic diversification fall apart in the regulatory process, has enhanced
Klein's position. By slowing down the expansion plans for a more thorough public
review of the environmental issues at stake, he has emerged as the savior not
only of northern Alberta's wildlands ecology, but of the government's
credibility.

BROADENED POWER

Now, as Bouchard's partner in the OSLO review decision, Klein has also blossomed
as a power in oil sands development. In doing so, he may have swept aside the
province's 60-year old protectionist attitude to jurisdiction over energy.

Perhaps the new stature of the environment ministry in Alberta is merely a sign
of the new ways of thinking about economics and politics that the environment is
producing.

Nevertheless, Bouchard has accomplished a significant incursion into provincial
jurisdiction, all the while protesting that his environmental agenda for Canada
is ideologically different from the last raid on provincial energy powers - the
1980 National Energy Program.

Now that Bouchard has broadened Ottawa's power without so much as a whimper from
Alberta, it remains to be seen how he will dispose of that power during the
clampdown he promises for carbon dioxide emissions during the next two years.

Oil and natural gas processing in Alberta accounts for more than a third of
Canada's carbon dioxide effluent. In a number of ways, through emission quotas
or carbon taxes, the federal government could penalize Alberta's economy and
devastate the future of oil and gas production.

Because Bouchard continues to mask the details of his energy policy and to snub
independent oil and gas producers in his so-called consultative process, it is
still not clear whether he understands that he can, by uninformed fiat, turn the
oil and gas sector into a dying industry - with serious consequences for the
health of the Canadian economy.

HELL'S HALF ACRE REVISITED: Old Turner Valley field a new resource

BYLINE: John Shiry

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT & FINANCE; Pg. 16, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 633 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


Looking for a Christmas gift for the person who has everything? Why not pick up
an oil or gas well for just $100?

The wells are part of the old Turner Valley field, now being developed as an
interpretive centre to document Alberta's first great oil discovery, and the oil
and gas industry.

Purchasers are offered a make-believe ''title'' to actual oil and gas wells.
They get to name their wells and receive a certificate showing name, operator
and location. Eventually, they will be able to tap into a computer at the Energy
Museum, run by the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board in Calgary, to
look up production data on their wells.

The Turner Valley Oilfield Society hopes to start construction in 1994 and to
open the Hell's Half Acre Interpretive Centre in 1997 - the 83rd anniversary of
the discovery well, Dingman No. 1, located on the site.

The well is named for Archibald Wayne Dingman, managing director of Calgary
Petroleum Products Co., the firm that drilled the well. The company was founded
by William S. Herron, a pioneer of the western oil industry.

Herron grew up in Ontario and spent his early years in the Pennsylvania
oilfields. Later he migrated to Alberta where he became interested in finding
oil and gas.

The story goes that one day he stopped for lunch along the Sheep River and
noticed gas bubbles coming out of the river bank. He sent samples off to U.S.
universities for analysis, which confirmed the gas was petroleum-based.

Herron bought as much land as he could, including the farm containing the gas
seep, and eventually filed claims for 7,000 acres around Turner Valley.

He sold his first backers, William Elder and Dingman, by setting up an old stove
over a gas seep, lighting the gas and frying eggs for them. They immediately
decided to back the venture. Other investors followed, including some notable
Calgarians of the day.

Dingman No. 1 hit wet gas on May 14, 1914, and the exploration boom that
followed marks the real start of the western oil and gas industry. The well
produced light oil that required little processing to be marketed as ''natural
gasoline.''

A later well, Royalite No. 4, hit high-pressure gas and blew out, creating a
plume of fire that lit up the sky for miles. The glow was visible from Calgary
and up close it created other images: the area became known as Hell's Half Acre.

Turner Valley laid the foundation of a new source of wealth in Alberta and was
the starting point for the exploration that eventually hit the Leduc field in
1947 and all that followed. Some of the companies at the forefront in Turner
Valley, such as Imperial Oil Ltd. and Home Oil Co. Ltd., are still giants of the
industry.

This is part of the legacy the Hell's Half Acre Interpretive Centre plans to
restore and make more accessible to the public. The location has already been
made a provincial historic site and is under review for national designation.

When completed, it will be one of the largest interpretive centres in the world
dedicated to the oil and gas industry. It will be the only one to use an actual
industrial site: the old Western Decalta Petroleum Ltd. gas-processing plant.

Exhibits will include originals or reconstructions of plants showing the early
advances in oil production and natural gas-processing technology. In many cases,
the plants built in Turner Valley were among the first in the world to employ
the new processes that became building blocks for the global gas industry.


Larry Clausen, who heads the fund-raising drive, says: ''Most of the activity in
the oil and gas industry takes place underground or inside pipes. The
interpretive centre will make this more accessible to the visitor. There will be
a lot of participation in the exhibits.''

Whaleback ruling stands

BYLINE: EVA FERGUSON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A14

LENGTH: 358 words


The province won't appeal a controversial decision to reject a gas well proposal
in the Whaleback, though it could have received $ 2 billion from successful
exploration.

Alberta Environment Minister Brian Evans confirmed Thursday that his department
has accepted the ruling of the Energy Resources Conservation Board to save the
sensitive region from development.

"We have a specific process in this province to ensure projects like this
receive an open and thorough review . . . That's what has happened here and we
accept that," he said after addressing delegates in Calgary at a waste
management conference sponsored by Environment Canada.

Last week, the ERCB cited environmental reasons for rejecting the gas well
proposal in the area of grasslands about 120 kilometres south of Calgary.

The board said it isn't in the public interest to approve an energy development
that might "compromise a scarce or unique" ecological area.

Although the province has received up to $ 1.6 million for mineral rights in the
area, estimated development in the gas field could have meant $ 900 million in
royalties and total provincial revenue of $ 2 billion including taxes.

Evans, however, wasn't surprised by the board's concern for unique wildlife
there, particularly in light of a recent report commissioned by the province
examining the sensitivity of the area.

"There's no question the Whaleback is a sensitive area," Evans added. "The
report states that critical wildlife is a concern and although resource
extraction was allowed it could only be done in a sustainable manner -- if there
was no loss to wildlife."


rm were to pull into a tie with the Bloc, the House of Commons would then vote
on which party should become the official Opposition.

Manning likes his party's chances in that situation, saying he would expect
Liberal MPs to back the federalist Reformers, not the separatist Bloc.

"We assume that under those circumstances, a federal party would have a pretty
good chance of carrying the judgment of other members to be the official
Opposition," he said. "So we're getting closer to that position."

EDMOND - Council members Monday will consider five programs to answer Edmond's
energy efficiency and conservation needs.

Federal stimulus money would pay for the programs. Edmond is applying for a
$726,700 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Council members will consider the programs as part of the application process
when they meet at 5:30 p.m. at 20 S Littler Ave. A public hearing will be held
on the proposed programs.

City officials will learn in September if they get the money.

Shannon Entz, the city's Community Development manager, said the staff has met
several times to come up with effective programs to meet the community's energy
efficiency and resource conservation needs.

They are recommending these programs:

CONSERVATION BOARD TO DECIDE ON HEARINGS

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 237 words


The Energy Resources Conservation Board will take about a week to decide whether
to hold hearings into 14 gas wells proposed at Dinosaur Provincial Park.

Board spokesman Peter Kinnear said Wednesday that the board has asked the
Alberta Wilderness Association for more information to substantiate the need for
a hearing.

At a news conference this week, the AWA, a Calgary-based environmental group,
accused the provincial government of revamping the park boundaries to
accommodate energy development.

AWA president Cliff Wallis said that in 1993, the government deleted upland
prairie that's becoming increasingly rare, while adding to the park badlands
that are not particularly threatened.

The government should do an environmental-impact assessment, allowing for pubic
input, into the park boundary change, said AWA conservation director Dianne
Pachal.

While Kathy Telfer of the Alberta Environmental Protection, said changes were
made to enhance and expand the park, Pachal said lands taken out of the park are
nationally significant.

"It's the age-old problem. The government is selling mineral leases without any
public notice or opportunity for the public to have a say until the last minute
when the company applies for a well licence," Pachal said.

At least two wells would be within the park boundaries, while the remainder
would be in a nationally significant area near the park.

New posting 'cynical'

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 721 words


Naming Ken Kowalski to head the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board is a break
with history and could damage Alberta's international reputation for sound
energy regulation, says one of the foremost experts on the Energy Resources
Conservation Board.

"If I were Albertan, and I was for many years, I would be quite appalled," said
David Breen, author of an 800-page history of the oil industry's regulator.

"I would see this as a remarkably cynical and thoughtless appointment," said
Breen, who questioned whether Premier Ralph Klein understood the board's history
for impartial regulation of what will now be $ 30 billion in commerce.

"It seems to me to be such as blatant diminishing of what has been a proud and
honorable institution.

"If you come from the midst of the political arena, you're tainted," said Breen,
a University of British Columbia history professor.

The government has never appointed a politician to head the ERCB, consciously
avoiding any impression that the board is subject to government influence, Breen
said. To achieve the same impartial leadership, it has also avoided industry
veterans, opting for scientists, academics and career civil servants with an
extensive regulatory experience.

"There are certainly examples one could draw on where the board's been leaned on
pretty heavily" by both industry and government, but the previous chairmen have
an honorable history of ignoring that pressure, Breen said.

Breen said the dangers of political interference are enormous. If the government
wants to hike short-term revenue, it could call on the ERCB to relax production
restrictions. But that can reduce the total long-term oil production. Royalty
revenue may jump, but it will not be in the public interest.

Kowalski's first job will be to merge the Calgary-based ERCB and the
Edmonton-based Public Utilities Board, placing regulation of the oil and natural
gas exploration and production, coal mining, electrical generation and household
billing for gas and power under one roof.

He will be the public watchdog over everything from power bills to environmental
protection of land, water and air. It's not known where the new board will
locate.

Oil industry leaders had a guarded reaction Friday.

Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said
the former deputy premier brings plenty of experience in public life to the
position.

Myron Kanik, president of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association, said it's
too early to pass comment. "We just don't understand it. We need more facts,"
Kanik said.

However, some senior industry players, speaking off the record, said they were
shocked by the appointment.

"It's one of those cases where you pick up the paper and turn it upside down and
see if it reads better," said one industry leader.

"If you were to be cynical about it, you would say it was a producer win and an
environmental loss. But that's a backlash problem in the making, too.

"The perceptional thing is that if you won (a ruling) before Mr. Kowalski, you
may well lose in the public forum. You win, but you lose, that's the problem
with politicizing it," he said.

Inside the ERCB, the mood ranged from profound surprise to optimism among its
620 employees.

The recent squeeze of government cuts has placed employees under increased
pressure to process drilling licences quicker. There are fears that will
intensify, jeopardizing the conservation of the resources.

Gas well blows out near activist's home

BYLINE: Canwest News Service

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B12

LENGTH: 196  words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


A gas well blew out in northwestern Alberta early yesterday, not far from the
home of oilpatch activist Wiebo Ludwig.

A crew of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. workers were drilling a sweet gas well
when it blew out around 3 a.m. local time, said Bob Curran, a spokesman for the
Energy Resources Conservation Board. No one was hurt, and the gas started to be
flared off immediately, Curran said.

Escaping gas was still being flared off five hours after the incident, and
Energy Resources Conservation Board officials and air-monitoring specialists
were en route to the site.

Canadian Natural Resources spokesman Cam Kramer said 12 people were on the
drilling crew. The well is licensed as a sour gas well, but was targeting a
natural sweet gas zone.

Curran said that although the crew was looking for sweet gas, the Energy
Resources Conservation Board will assume there is sour gas content until they
can prove otherwise.

Sour gas, unlike sweet gas, contains significant amounts of hydrogen sulphide
(H2S), a compound that can be extremely dangerous to people.

Kramer said a well blowout like this is extremely rare and he could not recall
if Canadian Natural had ever before had one.

CITY ASKING ERCB TO ALLOW NEW POWER LINE

BYLINE: EVA FERGUSON

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 224 words


Residents of East Springbank can air concerns

Residents living west of the city limits in East Springbank have until Nov. 25
to air any concerns they might have over a new $ 3-million power line to be
built in their area next year.

The city's electric system has filed an application with the Energy Resources
Conservation Board to construct a five-kilometre long transmission line which
runs from TransAlta's substation at 50th Avenue and Sarcee Trail S.W., north to
the city's substation at 101st Street and Bearspaw Dam Road S.W.

Eric Cameron, electric system spokesman, says the power line will help to serve
the city's growing outerlying communities.

"If we don't get the line approved and built, we will have a significant amount
of reliability problems.

"People will just have more power outages and the outages will last longer," he
said..

"Because the city keeps growing, our electrical distribution has to grow to keep
up with the demand."

Since city council has already approved the $ 3 million expenditure as part of
the five-year capital budget program, electric system officials only need ERCB
approval which will depend on how many objections they get from nearby
residents.

Anyone who has questions or concerns can call John Voss, planning engineer for
the city's electric system, at 268-2863.

Energy companies want federal earthquake lawsuit dismissed

BYLINE: By Paul Monies Business Writer pmonies@oklahoman.com

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 881 words


Devon Energy Corp. is selling wastewater disposal wells that have come under
voluntary directives to reduce volumes amid an increase in triggered earthquakes
in Oklahoma, the company disclosed in response to a federal lawsuit.The energy
company said all of its disposal wells into the deep Arbuckle formation were
part of a previously announced $200 million deal to sell noncore assets in
Oklahoma's Mississippian formation. White Star Petroleum LLC, formerly American
Energy-Woodford LLC, is the buyer.Oklahoma Corporation Commission records show
Devon has 15 active Arbuckle disposal wells. The company declined to confirm
that number.

White Star said the pending transaction, announced April 20, includes 555
horizontal production wells in the Mississippi Lime and Woodford
Shale.&nbsp;Devon made the disclosure in its response to a federal lawsuit filed
in February by Oklahoma Sierra Club members. The lawsuit, filed under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, wants Devon, Chesapeake Energy Corp. and
New Dominion LLC to immediately reduce production waste that could be
contributing to the rise in triggered earthquakes.The Sierra Club also wants the
court to set up an independent earthquake monitoring and prediction center to
analyze wastewater volumes and the links to induced seismicity.The three energy
companies want a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. SandRidge Energy Inc. was
added to the lawsuit in April, but its involvement has been stayed after the
company filed for bankruptcy last month.In separate legal filings, the  three
companies said the Oklahoma Corporation Commission is already taking action to
reduce the volumes of wastewater in disposal wells.The commission has issued a
series of voluntary directives covering more than 600 Arbuckle disposal wells.
In addition, the Coordinating Council on Seismic Activity brings together
regulators, researchers and energy industry representatives.&nbsp;"Through the
efforts of the governor, the state legislature, the OCC and other state
agencies, Oklahoma is in the midst of implementing a coherent, well-coordinated
and comprehensive public policy to address seismicity," Chesapeake
said.&nbsp;While the companies were responsible for about two-thirds of the
wastewater injected in 2014, they said any injunction against them wouldn't
cover other operators who might also be contributing to induced seismicity.The
companies also said anybody with concerns should go through the Corporation
Commission to modify injection well permits."Accordingly, any person who objects
to the manner in which the OCC has addressed, or failed to address, seismicity
concerns may petition the OCC to modify, or even terminate, any Class II well
permit to account for seismicity risks," Chesapeake said.In response, the Sierra
Club said in legal filings it had no issues with the state's response, but it
believes more could be done. It said commission action hasn't stopped the
Oklahoma earthquakes, with more than 300 recorded since the beginning of the
year with magnitude greater than 3.0. More than 50 earthquakes in that category
came in April.The group said it hasn't had any opportunity to oppose permits
because all the volume reductions so far have been voluntary."The OCC has not
yet issued a mandatory order to reduce injection," the Sierra Club said in its
response to the motions to dismiss. "In addition, the voluntary directives
issued to date have not stopped the earthquakes, or&nbsp;even reduced their
frequency or intensity."Proper venue?Much of the legal wrangling at this stage
of the case involves whether the Sierra Club members can bring a lawsuit under
the&nbsp;Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a 1976 federal law that allows
citizen lawsuits over hazardous waste.&nbsp;Attorneys for Devon said the Sierra
Club hasn't alleged any pollution or contamination from the injection of
wastewater."The only allegation of imminent and substantial endangerment in
plaintiff's complaint is that the injection of wastewater has caused increased
seismic activity," Devon said. "However, increased seismic activity could also
result from the injection of fluids to enhance oil and gas production, the
injection of carbon dioxide for storage, or injection of freshwater to prevent
saltwater infiltration. These materials are not regulated under RCRA."New
Dominion said the attempt to use the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
could implicate the entire upstream oil and gas industry sector."It appears that
this suit may have less to do with the stated requests for relief and more to do
with crippling Oklahoma's oil and gas industry," New Dominion said.The Sierra
Club said the federal law was intended to address a broad array of environmental
issues. In any case, the group said, the courts were the proper venue to address
its request for the companies to reinforce vulnerable structures that could be
affected by large earthquakes, an area where the Corporation Commission has no
jurisdiction."Plaintiff is not attempting to stop all wastewater injection in
the state of Oklahoma," the Sierra Club said. "Instead, plaintiff is only
seeking to restrict the well injections by the four defendants, because they are
responsible for most of the wastewater injections into the Arbuckle formation."

VIII. Vigorously Promote Ecological Civilization

Building ecological civilization is a long-term program of lasting importance
that affects the welfare and future well-being of the people. We must give
prominence to ecological civilization, work hard to build a beautiful China in
order to realize sustainable development for the Chinese people. [applause]

We must uphold the basic state policy of resource conservation and environment
protection; uphold policy of giving priority to conservation, protection, and
nature recovery; put forth effort to promote green, recycling, and low-carbon
development to form an environment setup of resource conservation and
environment protection.

We must reverse the trend of deteriorating ecological environment from the
sources, such as our industrial structure, production mode, and life style. We
must create a good production and living environment for the people, and make
contribution to global ecological safety. For the current and future period, we
must focus on doing a proper job for the four tasks listed below:

1. We must improve the development setup for state land. We must control the
development pace and adjust the space structure by following the principle of
striking a balance between population and natural environment and between
economic, social, and ecological benefit, in order to leave more recovery space
for the nature and leave more fertile farmland for the agriculture, and leave
for our future generations a beautiful homeland with blue skies, green lands,
and clean water. [applause]

We must speed up implementation of the strategy for main functional areas; build
a scientific and reasonable structure for urbanization, agricultural
development, and ecological safety; raise our capability in exploring ocean
resources; firmly uphold the state's ocean rights and interests, and build into
a strong marine country.

2. We must fully promote resource conservation. We must thriftily utilize our
resources, and promote fundamental changes in the use of resources. We must
drastically cut our energy, water, and land consumption. We must promote
revolution in energy production and consumption; support energy-saving and
low-carbon industry, and development of new and renewable energy to safeguard
the nation's energy safety. We must strictly follow the red line for farmland
protection and control of land usage; develop recycling economy, and promote
reduction and recycling in production, circulation and consumption processes.

3. We must intensify protection of the natural ecosystem and environment, and
implement major natural recovery projects. We must speed up water conservancy
projects, and strengthen building of a system to prevent and reduce natural
disasters. We must insist on preventive and comprehensive management and focus
on resolving the issues of public health hazards and environment by
strengthening preventive treatment for water, air, and land pollution. We must
work together with the international community to actively deal with global
climate change, on the principles of common but differentiated responsibility,
fairness, and respective capabilities.

4. We must strengthen the building of an ecological civilization system. We must
set up the target, system, assessment methodology, and penalty and reward
mechanism that meet the requirement of ecological civilization. We must build a
system for state land development and protection, strengthen environment
supervision and control, and strengthen educational propaganda for ecological
civilization. We must increase the awareness for conservation, environmental
protection and ecosystem among the people, and cultivate the good habits of
treasuring the ecological environment. We must value the nature with more
self-awareness, protect the ecosystem more actively, and work hard to march
toward a new era of socialist ecological civilization. [applause]

ELECTRICITY BID REJECTED

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C4

LENGTH: 274 words


A tiny Calgary energy company, partially backed by the town of Stettler, has
failed in a bid to build an electricity plant and 30-acre greenhouse near the
central Alberta community.

The province's Energy Resources Conservation Board has rejected the $ 27-million
proposal of Energy Consultants Inc. to construct the natural gas-fired plant to
generate 25 megawatts of electricity.

The ERCB said the power will not be needed until the year 2000 and its benefits
would not be offset by the $ 6 million a year that Albertans would have had to
pay for the electricity.

"There is no pressing need to look at it now," said Mike Asgar-Deen, an ERCB
engineer.

The $ 6-million cost was based on Energy Consultants' projection that it needed
3.95 cents per kilowatt per hour to make the plant viable. But Alberta's major
electrical utilities said they can produce a kilowatt per hour for less than one
cent, said Asgar-Deen.

However, the regulators said the greenhouse appeared to be viable on its own
given the company's financial projections.

"A lot of the benefits would come from the greenhouse," Asgar-Deen said. The
plan called for the greenhouse to be heated by excess steam from the electrical
plant.

Colin Jackson, president of Energy Consultants, could not be reached for
comment.

Alberta's two major electrical utilities - TransAlta Utilities Corp. and Alberta
Power Ltd. - opposed the application based on the lack of need for more power
generation, Asgar-Deen said. Stettler's commitment was $ 387,000 in land and
access roads for the plant and greenhouse.

Town officials could not be reached for comment.

City schoolgirl shines at Science Exhibition

LENGTH: 435 words

DATELINE: Ranchi


Ranchi, March 31 -- City school student Sangeeta Mandal outshined all
participants at the State-level 42nd Jawaharlal Nehru National Science
Exhibition 2014-15 on Monday with her unique model on energy resources and
conservation. The Class IX student had prepared a model on unexplored
utilisation of geothermal energy from hot springs of India.

Besides, grabbing the Champion's Trophy at the exhibition, she also secured the
first position in the category of energy resources and conservation of the
exhibition. Overall 101 models were presented by students of 21 districts.

For Sangeeta, it was not the first time when she was honoured. In January, she
was felicitated with 'Best Individual Model' and 'Best Model' at BITM, Kolkata
in January wherein 182 students across the eastern region displayed their
models. "I am on cloud nine and hope to shine Jharkhand's name at the National
Level of 42nd Jawaharlal Nehru National Science Exhibition scheduled in New
Delhi. I am grateful to my batch mate Juhi Kumari, Guide teacher SK Sinha and
parents for their constant support," she said. "In future as well, I hope to
work on unique models on energy resources since my ambition is to become a
Scientist," she added.

The Pioneer in its report 'Student finds daily use of geothermal energy'
published on March 30 had mentioned details about her innovation. She is a
student of class ninth at KB Girl's High School, Ratu Road. Like Sangeeta, three
girls of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, Bundu (KGBV) expressed joy over their
win. "We feel proud to study in KGBV. Every KGBV is appreciated for the
outstanding performance of girls in any field. Our life has completely
transformed. Now, when we go home from hostel, girls of our village try to copy
our behaivour. We teach them whatever we are learning in school," said Radha and
Rekha, who secured second position separately in communal health and waste
management.

Besides, KGBV Bundu, students of KGBV Kanke and KGBV Nirsa also bagged positions
among the top three winners in cultural programme and model making on historical
events in science and mathematics. 62 girls and 62 boys had presented their
scientific model based on five categories namely community health, epoch
historical events in science and mathematics, IT, waste management,
transportation, energy resources and conservation. Students were also
felicitated for participating in the cultural programme.

Tories lay out timeline for single energy regulator; New system should be in
place by 2013, Redford says

BYLINE: Kelly Cryderman, Calgary Herald

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 326 words


Premier Alison Redford has laid out a timeline for the province's move to a
single energy regulator, saying this week the new system will be in place by
next year. "We will introduce legislation this fall and we will have the new
regulator up and running by summer 2013," the premier told an unconventional gas
conference in Calgary on Tuesday.

The government has argued the single window approach is necessary because right
now, applications for everything from oil and gas, coal, water and land usage,
and carbon capture and storage sometimes get bogged down in red tape.

There are currently three departments involved - Energy, Environment and
Sustainable Resource Development - and one regulator, the Energy Resources
Conservation Board (ERCB). Companies will often be approved in one department
but then still have to submit the same application to another.

The new structure is a one-stop shopping approach, with one application and a
streamlined process. Redford said the reforms will ensure Alberta has a modern,
efficient, competitive regulatory system.

However, environmentalists have expressed concern this new system - like the
federal government's new legislation to expedite major energy projects - will
lead to developments being pushed through too quickly, without enough
consideration given to the effects on the land, water, animals, plants and
production of greenhouse gas emissions.

Redford insists this is not the case. The new system will be one "that continues
to maintain Alberta's strong commitment to environmental management, to public
safety, and to resource conservation," she said on Tuesday.

"No one has asked us to lower our standards for environmental protection.
Industry understands the importance of that and we won't lower those standards."

"This is not about cutting corners, but it is about eliminating clutter and
allowing you to be more competitive," the premier emphasized to the industry
crowd.

Tata Power's energy conservation initiatives yielding good results

LENGTH: 325 words

DATELINE: Jamshedpur


Jamshedpur, May 6 -- Tata Power's nationwide resource and energy conservation
movement Club Enerji, has been relentlessly spreading awareness about resource
conservation across the country.

In line with this, the Club Enerji movement has successfully achieved a
significant milestone of saving 11.2 million units of electricity by sensitising
more than 7 million citizens across 11 locations in Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad,
Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Lonavala, Maithon, Belgaum, Jamshedpur and Ranchi
since its inception and units saved by the Club is equivalent to the amount of
energy used to light up 5,266 houses for a year and save 11,000 tonnes of CO2
emissions. In the current financial year, Club Enerji saved over 2.5 million
units and sensitised over 1.5 million citizens.

Speaking on the initiative, Anil Sardana, managing director, Tata Power,
said,"We at Tata Power are delighted and proud to achieve this significant
milestone with our focused approach of spreading the message of energy
conservation across the country. We are thankful to all the students and schools
for supporting us in our efforts to save our planet. We are determined to
continue with our programme and sensitise the citizens of tomorrow about the
dire need of resource conservation along with moral & civic values."

In the coming years, the Club plans to roll out 'Waste Management Module' to
sensitise the country about the advantages of waste management and methods of
generating power using waste. Club Enerji banks on the youth of the nation and
has played a vital role in communicating efficient usage of energy. The club has
essentially worked towards curbing energy wastage, there by mitigating emission
of greenhouse gases that lead to global warming and climate change.

ELK PROVISO UNCHALLENGED

BYLINE: VICK BARNETT

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 639 words


Biologist unable to demonstrate drilling, road won't be disruptive

MAYCROFT -- A witness for a Calgary energy company was forced to admit Tuesday
that plans to drill a well in this area can't meet a key condition -- no
disruption to wildlife.

Under cross-examination at an Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) hearing
into Amoco Canada's proposal to drill a well in the Whaleback, biologist Luigi
Morgantini admitted he couldn't demonstrate the exploratory well and
accompanying road wouldn't disrupt elk in the area.

The plan for the area, approved by provincial cabinet, says development for
mineral resources will be permitted in the Whaleback Ridge-Bob Creek Critical
Wildlife Zone only if it can be demonstrated that there will be no net loss of
wildlife habitat or disruption of wildlife population. Amoco stated in its
written submission to the ERCB that it can meet the plan's guidelines.

The company is being challenged by environmentalists and local residents who
don't want industrial activity in Canada's largest remaining tract of montane
ecosystem -- a wildlife-rich combination of ridges and valleys dubbed the
Whaleback because they resemble a whale skeleton from the air.

Lawyer Harvey Locke, representing an environmental coalition, pointed out the
montane ecosystem is a priority for protection under the Alberta Special Places
2000 documents. However, Ron Findlay, Amoco's general manager of environment and
safety, insisted there are already enough examples of montane ecosystems in
Alberta in areas such as Waterton Lakes National Park.

Amoco said if the exploratory well is successful, the gas field could mean 1,500
jobs a year and the equivalent of $ 800 per Albertan in direct and indirect
benefits to the province.

Environmentalists, however, see the region as an ecological treasure.

Surrounded by horseshoes and branding irons hanging on the walls of the Maycroft
community hall, Locke cited a study by Amoco witness Morgantini, saying: "The
elk population in southern Alberta is already under serious pressure from
various land-use practices. Future potential industrial development in the
region may ultimately reduce the elk population to a few small widely-dispersed
surviving herds. That will be a great loss to the people of southern Alberta."

Morgantini agreed this concern would apply to Amoco's full development -- up to
20 wells if the sour gas field exists -- but noted only one well is up for
approval at this hearing.

He also acknowledged under cross-examination that there was a lack of
information on moose in the Whaleback region, and he couldn't show there
wouldn't be a loss of moose habitat because of the development.

Biologist John Kansas said the effects on black bears would be temporary because
most bears will come back to an area once drilling season ends. He agreed the
area is used by grizzlies in the spring and summer, but denied a single well
would have a negative impact on their habitat or on the bears "unless they are
shot."

Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice, representing residents of the Maycroft ranching
community, suggested Amoco hasn't adequately addressed public concerns about the
impact of its proposed development on the local agricultural community,
vegetation, surface and groundwater, fisheries, and the environment.

But Amoco environmental services supervisor John Ward said Amoco has looked at
these concerns and tried to reduce potential effects.

Under cross-examination by Prentice, Amoco admitted it hadn't met some ERCB
requirements.

In an April 22 letter to Prentice, Provincial Environment Minister Brian Evans
said: "It is Amoco's responsibility to provide the level of environmental
information necessary to support its application to the ERCB . . . "

Maycroft is 120 kilometres south of Calgary.

Amoco takes heat at Alberta gas probe

BYLINE: Laurie Ludwick

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 600 words

DATELINE: Maycroft, Alta.


Natural gas giant Amoco Canada Ltd. yesterday faced angry environmental groups
at a hearing into oil and gas development in the environmentally sensitive
eastern slopes region of Alberta.

The Calgary-based oil company is seeking approval from the Alberta Energy
Resources Conservation Board to drill a $5-million exploratory gas well on a
wildlife-rich area in the Rocky Mountain foothills, known as the Whaleback.

The eastern slopes region is the focus of heightened interest by the oil and gas
sector. Many companies, including Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., Home Oil Co. Ltd. and
Norcen Energy Resources Ltd., have invested millions of dollars in acquiring
mineral rights in the area. Industry officials believe the two-week ERCB hearing
could set a precedent on how the province views major exploration projects in
such undisturbed parts of the eastern slopes.

Amoco says potential reserves for the Whaleback project could be as much as 1.2
trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The company says total direct and indirect
investment in the venture could reach $1.2 billion, with as much as $2 billion
generated in royalties and other revenue over the life of the project for the
province.

Ron Findlay, Amoco's general manager of environment, told the hearing the
potential economic and social benefits to the province are ''immense.''

''We are committed to developing the Whaleback in an environmentally responsible
manner,'' Findlay said, referring to ''innovative'' techniques such as
directional and extended-reach drilling to minimize surface impact.

Environmental groups at the hearing claimed the province is seeking revenue it
needs to balance its budget while ignoring its own environmental guidelines.

The province has designated the Whaleback as a critical wildlife zone and has
said oil and gas development can proceed only if there is no disruption to local
wildlife. The area is the largest intact montane ecosystem in Canada, rich in
Douglas fir and timber pine, and is a winter habitat of elk.

Dianne Pachal, spokeswoman for the Whaleback Coalition which is fighting the
application, said ''the ERCB process is seriously flawed.''

''It is moving down that slippery slope to being a rubber-stamp for the Alberta
government.''

She noted the ERCB refused to call an Alberta government biologist to testify
about the Whaleback area. The biologist was the author of a letter to the ERCB
in January arguing that Amoco's internal environmental analysis of the
development was inadequate and additional study was required before the board
could properly assess the impact of the test well.

Jim Prentice, lawyer for the Hunter Creek Coalition, a group of local residents
opposed to the well, described the biologist's letter as ''a scathing indictment
of Amoco's environmental review.''

A lawyer for the province told the hearing the Whaleback project falls within
provincial environmental guidelines.

Amoco has promised to consult with area ranchers and farmers about the project.
But several local residents said in interviews they distrusted company claims
about protecting the environment.

''Sure they come to talk to you, but they don't listen,'' said Ted Smith, a
local rancher.

Mike Judd, a local outfitter who lives adjacent to Shell Canada Ltd.'s gas field
in nearby Waterton, said he wants to prevent Amoco from ''degrading'' the
Whaleback area.

''It's like the country got cancer. It started with a small growth known as an
exploratory well and before you know it, there are hundreds of wells which have
degraded the land.''

MLAs must give public greater voice in energy hearings

BYLINE: Cindy Chiasson, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: LETTERS; Pg. A17

LENGTH: 389  words


Re: "Sour gas drilling rules need review," Editorial, June 20.

The editorial on the current Energy Resources Conservation Board sour gas
hearing in Tomahawk discussed local residents' concerns about their limited
ability to participate in the hearing, and blames "the new, restrictive rules of
Bill 46." The statement about Bill 46 is incorrect.

While the rules that limit participation in ERCB hearings to "directly and
adversely affected" persons are definitely restrictive, they were not created by
Bill 46. These rules have applied to energy hearings in Alberta since 1971.

The only direct effect that Bill 46 had on sour gas or other energy hearings was
to create the ERCB, as part of the split of the former Energy and Utilities
Board into two separate bodies.

It's easy to blame the ERCB, as the agency that applies the rules.

While the ERCB has discretion in how it interprets and applies its rules, it
does not have the ability to change the legislated requirements that limit
public participation.

These rules have been set out for nearly 40 years in the Energy Resources
Conservation Act and can only be changed by our elected representatives in the
legislature.

Many Albertans have been unhappy with these rules of participation since their
creation; it is the increased growth and pace of energy development in recent
years that has increased the volume and exposure of this dissatisfaction.

However, delaying the Tomahawk hearing until the ERCB comes out with new setback
regulations or protesting to the ERCB about "directly and adversely affected"
status may only affect piecemeal change, if any change at all.

The draft land-use framework, currently open for public comment, offers the
possibility of changing how the public participates in all land-use decisions,
including energy development. That is why is it so important that Albertans take
the opportunity to express their concerns and views to the provincial government
on the land-use framework.

Another important tool available to citizens unhappy with the ERCB participation
rules is the right to communicate directly with MLAs.

MLAs have the power to change the rules of the game before the ERCB, and who
have often escaped scrutiny in the public debate over ERCB process and public
participation.

Warming and Climate change is a reality today. There is an urgent need to
educate and bridge the gap for simpler and easier energy conservation practices.
Club Enerji is a platform which is fast gaining acceptance and thereby making
the next generation more aware of this situation. Energy-Q seeks to impart
knowledge and information on energy conservation, climate change, global warming
and resource conservation while testing young minds in a challenging, fun and
engaging manner."

Embraced by schools, students, Principals and heads of educational institutions,
"The Energy Conservation programme- Club Enerji" touched a new milestone by
creating the right platform to test young minds for the next level and thereby
kick-starting 'Energy- Q', an all-India, inter-city quiz contest to challenge
young minds on their Energy Quotient.

About Tata Power Club Enerji:

Tata Power started its school outreach programme, "Tata Power Energy Club" in
2007. In 2009, Club Enerji took its next big leap, with the programme turning
into a national movement, covering more than 250 schools across Mumbai, Delhi,
Pune, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Belgaum, Jamshedpur and Lonavla and further
attained a new milestone of achieving over one million citizens sensitization
and more than one million units energy savings. School children, from Class III
to Class IX, are taught the importance of conserving energy through innovative
modules which include audiovisuals and power point presentations. Children are
imparted energy saving and resource conservation tips during these sessions,
usage of which have shown dramatic savings. In 2010-11, Tata Power Energy Club
sensitized over 2.5 lakh children across 285 schools nationwide; these children
have further reached out to more than eight lakh people, thereby taking the
total sensitization figure to over 1 (One) million citizens. The Club members
have collectively saved 2,019,563 units of electricity.

Protests launched at Caroline hearings

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 328 words

DATELINE: Caroline,Alta.


  Three heavyweight public interest intervenors failed yesterday in a bid to
derail a hearing into development of the $10-billion Caroline natural gas
discovery in west-central Alberta.

Energy Resources Conservation Board chairman Gerry DeSorcy rejected a six-week
adjournment request from the Preservation of Agriculture & Living Space Society,
the Concerned Residents Action Group, and environmental activist Martha Kostus
when the hearing began yesterday. The environmental groups wanted the
development proposals reviewed for human safety using just-published board
models that evaluate risks for hydrogen sulphide omissions.

However, both Shell Canada Ltd. and Husky Oil Operations Ltd., which have
competing proposals for the Caroline development, told the hearing that
preliminary evaluations using the GasCon and GasRisk computer models have shown
that the risk assessments are already more conservative than the new standards.

DeSorcy said the companies must complete the new assessments and bring the
results to the hearing. The opening slavos of the scheduled three-week hearing,
however, indicate environmental and community concerns will dominate the debate.

Yesterday, more than 175 people packed the Caroline agricultural society
complex, about 120 kilometres west of Calgary for the hearing. The three-man
panel includes DeSorcy and board members Frank Mink and Brian Bietz.

There are 50 registered intervenors including 34 community interest groups who
will be cross examining expert witnesses at the hearing.

Shell Canada, which made the Caroline discovery in 1986 and owns 62% of the
established reserve, wants to build a new gas processing plant in the centre of
the field as part of a $820-million project. Husky Oil has a $700-million plan
to pipe the gas 54 kilometres to the north end of the field where it would
expand the existing Ram River gas plant's operations to handle one billion cubic
feet a day.

Plains Midstream charged over 2011 oil spill

BYLINE: SHAWN McCARTHY

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; ENERGY; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 443 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


Plains Midstream Canada could face up to $1.5-million in fines after the Alberta
government laid charges Friday for the company's 2011 pipeline rupture that
resulted in the province's largest oil spill in 36 years.

The company, which is a subsidiary of Houston-based Plains All American Pipeline
L.P., was hit with three charges under the Environmental Protection and
Enhancement Act: for releasing a toxic substance, failing to take proper
measures to contain the leak and failing to properly manage it. Each charge
carries a maximum $500,000 fine.

The company offered little comment Friday, except that it is "evaluating" the
charges. "We will be reviewing them with our counsel and the Crown, and will
respond formally with our position in due course," it said in a statement.

The Rainbow Pipeline fractured two years ago, spilling 28,000 barrels of light
sweet crude into the area around the Woodland Cree reserve, northeast of Peace
River. In a report on the accident issued in February, the province's Energy
Resources Conservation Board found major flaws in the company's operations and
maintenance procedures, including leak-detection alarms and response. But the
ERCB did not fine the company.

The 2011 spill generated international headlines, coming less than a year after
Enbridge Inc.'s high-profile rupture in Michigan, and as TransCanada Corp. was
looking for U.S. approval for its still-delayed Keystone XL pipeline.

On the same day the charges were announced, Greenpeace Canada published a report
on the incident that accuses the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the
government of working with the oil industry to downplay the spill, and of being
primarily concerned about the public-relations damage to the industry, which has
faced stiff opposition to plans to construct crude pipelines through British
Columbia and the United States.

Among other things, the documents show the ERCB's chief operating officer
rejected a request from staff members for a full public inquiry into the
accident.

Alberta Environment spokesman Wayne Wood said it is "pure coincidence" that the
charges were laid on the same day the Greenpeace report criticized the
government for inaction. "Because charges have been laid and the matter is
considered before the courts, we won't be commenting on the Greenpeace report,"
he said.

Plains Midstream is now teaming up with Keyera Corp. on a plan to build a
pipeline to send natural gas liquids like propane and butane from the
liquids-rich gas fields of northwestern Alberta and northeastern British
Columbia to Fort Saskatchewan, Alta.

Sierra Club sues three energy companies over earthquakes

BYLINE: Journal Record Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 543  words


OKLAHOMA CITY (JR) - The Oklahoma Sierra Club on Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit
against three Oklahoma energy companies, asking the court to order an immediate
reduction of wastewater being injected underground.

The plaintiff cited violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act by
Chesapeake Operating LLC, Devon Energy Production Co. and New Dominion LLC.

"This action is brought to enforce significant and ongoing violations of RCRA
(the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), Section 7002(a)(1)(B), that are
placing people and the environment in Oklahoma and Kansas at significant and
immediate risk from major man-made earthquakes induced by Defendants' waste
disposal practices," the Sierra Club argued in the petition.

The Sierra Club further asked the court to establish an independent office to
assess how much wastewater can be safely injected into the earth. The petition
claimed that "no government body is currently taking a holistic or proactive
view of waste injection and its potential to induce earthquakes. "

The Oklahoma Sierra Club is represented locally by Oklahoma City attorney
William B. Federman. The club is also represented by Richard Webster of
Washington, D.C.-based Public Justice, as well as Arkansas attorney Scott
Poynter and New York law firm Weitz and Lutzenberg, PC.

Public Justice on Oct. 29 notified the three defendants and SandRidge Energy of
its intention to file a lawsuit under RCRA. None of the four companies offered
comment at the time.  Devon spokesman John Porretto said the company had nothing
to add regarding the notice-of-intent-to-sue letter. SandRidge Investor
Relations and Strategy Executive Vice President Duane Grubert wrote in an email
to The Journal Record that the driller does not comment on speculation about
litigation, and representatives from Chesapeake and New Dominion did not reply
to requests for comment.

The lawsuit could force drillers to change wastewater disposal practices,
attorney David P. Page said at the time. It would become the first public
lawsuit that attempts to hold oil and gas companies accountable for the
thousands of earthquakes that rumbled across the state in the last several
years.

It may be difficult to fight the lawsuit because it's not necessary to
conclusively prove that an operator's disposal wells triggered specific
earthquakes, said Page, an attorney who has practiced energy and environmental
law in Oklahoma for 35 years. He is not involved in this case.

The cited passage of the RCRA says that any person may commence a civil action
on his own behalf against any owner or operator of a disposal facility who is
contributing to the disposal of any hazardous waste that may present an imminent
and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.

"The science laid out in our case is clear," Public Justice Executive Director
Paul Bland said in a press release. "Oklahoma may be on the verge of
experiencing a strong and potentially catastrophic earthquake. All evidence
points to alarming seismic activity in and around fracking operations, and that
activity is becoming more frequent and more severe. "

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL LAW UNDER FIRE

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B13

LENGTH: 449 words


Conservationists are questioning the effectiveness of Alberta's new
environmental legislation less than a month after it came into effect.

Rob Macintosh, of the Syncrude Environmental Assessment Coalition, said his
group was stunned to hear the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) and the
Alberta Environmental Protection Department believe energy projects should not
have to comply with the environmental assessment provisions of the new
legislation.

The coalition is seeking leave to appeal an ERCB decision in Alberta Court of
Appeal today in an effort to show energy projects should fall under the
legislation.

The controversy follows a recent statement by ERCB chairman Frank Mink. He made
his comments during hearings in Fort McMurray into Syncrude's application to
increase production to 12 million from 10 million cubic meters of synthetic
crude oil per year.

The coalition is concerned the move would result in increases in emissions over
the next few years.

Mink, who rejected a coalition request to adjourn the hearings to give Syncrude
time to go through the new act's environmental assessment process, said the
board isn't precluded from dealing with the case by the new legislation.

Macintosh said the decision means the board can go ahead and grant approvals for
energy projects before the new legislation's requirements for an environmental
impact assessment are complied with.

He said the ruling "cannot be allowed to stand because it would defeat the
entire purpose of having environmental impact assessments (EIAs) available to
decision makers prior to approvals being given."

Mink said it's inappropriate for him to comment because it's up to the court to
decide how the new law should be interpreted, and because he's in the middle of
a hearing.

But ERCB lawyer Bob Heggie said the Syncrude application doesn't fall under the
new legislation because the application was made a year ago, and an
environmental assessment was done and submitted to the provincial government.

"The board isn't about to ignore the legislation when it's appropriate . . .
We're going to be looking at the spirit and intent of the law, and make sure
EIAs are done and included in our process," Heggie said.

He said the board adjourned its hearings for 10 days to allow time to ensure it
has correctly interpreted the legislation.

Macintosh said if the Court of Appeal rules in favor of his organization, "then
the Syncrude expansion will have to go through the environmental assessment
process and then return to the board for further consideration."

If the case goes against them, environmentalists will push for changes to the
legislation, he said.

MUMBAI: Club Enerji, Tata Power's nationwide resource and energy conservation
movement has been relentlessly spreading awareness about resource conservation
across the country. Continuing with the momentum of Tata Power Club Enerji's
Waste Management Module, Ryan International School Kandivali (East)organised a
cleanliness drive in their neighbourhood.

More than 100 students participated and cleaned an area of over a kilometre
around their school in Kandivali while sensitising citizens about the importance
of Waste Management. The students collected waste and recyclable material which
were further sent for recycling. As per the programme module for this year, the
plastic bottles collected by the students will be converted into t-shirts for
the participants.

Speaking on this initiative, Mr. Anil Sardana, Managing Director, Tata Power,
commented, "This year, we plan to take the programme to a higher level with
focus not only on energy conservation but also on resource conservation and
moral and civic values. The actions and contributions of the Energy Brigade has
come a long way in making a positive impact on the environment. We would like to
thank the students and management of Ryan International for participating and
extending their support to this initiative."

Club Enerji aims to instil civic responsibilities and management qualities in
children to better manage their future and also help them spread the
conservation message to their parents, peers and society at large. The Waste
Management module educates students about the hazards of waste dumping on the
environment and its impact on the ecosystem.

For saving electricity, five schools divvy up $60,000

BYLINE: Jon Pompia, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 672 words


March 11--As a select group of Pueblo City Schools (D60) students discovered, it
not only pays to conserve energy, it pays well.

For five weeks, students in eight D60 schools -- Bessemer Academy, Central High
School, Fountain International Magnet Schools, Heroes K-8 Academy, Highland Park
Elementary, Irving Elementary, Roncalli STEM Academy and Sunset Park Elementary
-- took part in an energy-savings competition entitled ReNew Our Schools.

Organized by the nonprofit Center for ReSource Conservation and funded by the
Colorado Energy Office, the contest provided students a hands-on opportunity to
demonstrate how much electricity can be saved simply by changing energy
behaviors: using only as much light as needed, unplugging appliances when not in
use and so on.

The eight schools were divided into two groups based on student counts. Starting
in January, the young men and women were tasked -- under the tutelage of
administrators, staff and energy sector mentors -- with not only saving as much
energy as possible within the school, but taking conservation methods into the
home.

Final scores reflected school-measured savings, and school and home energy
actions.

"The students really stepped up to help the schools save energy," said Kathy
Croasdale, program manager for the Center for ReSource Conservation. "And less
energy use means lower utility bills for schools."

As well as a hefty payday.

Thursday inside the D60 administration building, the local competition's two top
energy conserving schools -- Bessemer Academy (Group 1) and Heroes K-8 Academy
(Group 2) -- each pocketed a cool $18,000 from Kathy Croasdale of the Center for
ReSource Conservation.

Another Group 2 school, Irving Elementary School, took home $12,000 for being
runner- up, while in the first group, Fountain International Magnet

School and Sunset Park Elementary School tied for second place, each being
awarded $6,000.

The prize funds will be used to make additional energy-saving changes to the
buildings, such as installing motion sensors and LED lights and purchasing more
energy-efficient appliances.

Overall, the eight D60 schools logged an average savings of 16 percent -- twice
as high as any other average in a ReNew Our Schools competition.

Individually, Bessemer Academy's savings of 20.4 percent was tops, followed
closely by Heroes K-8's mark of 19.6 percent.

As students discovered over the course of the project, there is a science to
energy savings. In fact, Karlie Zabukovic, a STEM teacher on special assignment
within the district, said at Bessemer Academy, scientific principles paved the
way to $18,000.

"The kids had these light meters that told them the level of the lux (a measure
of illuminance) in the building," Zabukovic said. "So if it's over 440, it's
overlit. And with natural light, the reading is almost 400 anyway.

"As part of the school audit, students also took the temperatures in the
classrooms, just to learn about that, as well."

At Heroes K-8 Academy, eighth-grade science teacher Susan Sandoval said the big
win was a result of a cohesive and, well, energetic effort.

"The little kids, at first, thought they were competing against the bigger
kids," Sandoval said. "But in the end, they realized it was a whole-school
thing.

"At a kickoff assembly, I asked a little kid, 'What is energy?' And he started
running in place saying 'This is energy!' But by the end of each day, they all
were giving me high fives because they knew the kind of energy we were saving."

In the end, the Bessemer Academy youngsters discovered that, ironically, energy
enlightenment relies heavily on an absence of light.

"I think we won because we worked really hard and were basically living in the
dark," said Arianna Vigil, a fifth-grader at Bessemer Academy.

"But with flashlights," added schoolmate Larayah Martinez. "And it was kinda fun
going to school in the dark." jpompia@chieftain.com

OILPATCH WATCHDOGS TO MERGE

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D8

LENGTH: 484 words


Industry officials applaud measures to cut expenditures

The Alberta government plans to merge its energy regulators, stop selling crude
oil to collect petroleum royalties, and shut down its oilsands research,
development and investment agencies.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board will merge with the Public Utilities
Board under a new name - the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board, the province
announced in its throne speech Thursday.

However, it is unknown how much will be saved or if layoffs will result. The
ERCB costs the province about $ 20 million a year, while the PUB is a $
1.1-million expense.

Energy Minister Patricia Black has scheduled a news conference for this morning
to announce details of her department's restructuring.

Under the plan, three well-known energy agencies are about to disappear.

The Klein government is folding three agencies into the Energy Department - the
Alberta Oil Sands Technology Research Authority (AOSTRA), Alberta Oil Sands
Equity and the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission.

AOSTRA, a $ 20-million annual expense, is developing technology to cut the cost
of extracting petroleum from northeast Alberta's massive oilsands reserves. The
government has been trying to sell its share of the project but has found only
limited interest.

Oilsands Equity, which costs $ 2.5 million per year, manages the province's
investment in Syncrude Canada Ltd. and the Lloydminster and Husky heavy oil
upgraders.

The petroleum marketing commission, which costs Alberta $ 7.5 million annually,
sells the crude oil collected by the province as its royalties. The government
will soon begin to take payments of oil royalties in cash, as it does for
natural gas.

The Energy Department changes, recommended by a private consulting firm, were
welcomed by industry officials.

Harry Wheeler, president of Cabre Exploration Ltd., said the province's
departure from crude oil is long overdue.

"These are basically the kinds of things that we all thought should be done,"
Wheeler said.

Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said
few oil people support any government research grants during this era of public
cost-cutting.

"It's pretty hard to argue for a government grant of any kind," Protti said.

In administrative matters, the province will implement a plan to collect royalty
information electronically.

"It will just mean lower costs to industry and lower costs to the government,"
Protti said.

One program that was conspicuous by its absence in the throne speech was the
Alberta Royalty Tax Credit, which returns $ 245 million a year in royalties to
oil companies.

The credit is set to expire at year end and could greatly help the province's
deficit fight. Protti said he expects to see some announcement on the credit in
the provincial budget, scheduled for release on Feb. 24.

Tata Power's Club Enerji celebrates 'World Car Free Day'

BYLINE: India Blooms News Service

LENGTH: 443  words


Kolkata/ Mumbai, Sept 22 (IBNS): Tata Power's nationwide energy conservation
programme, Club Enerji, has constantly endeavored to propagate the critical need
to conserve energy and our natural resources across the country through students
from various schools.

In continuance with this dedication, Mini Club Enerji of Tata Power across the
nation on Monday celebrated World Car Free Day to spread awareness on protection
of the environment. Students of Club Enerji participated in energy conservation
rallies and enthusiastically chanted slogans such as Save fuel, Save the Earth,
carried handmade posters and banners, and placards with paintings depicting
various ways to conserve the environment and reduce the use of fossil fuels such
as petrol and diesel. The students motivated pedestrians and people at traffic
signals to celebrate World Car Free Day and minimize the use of private vehicles
to reduce environment pollution. Club Enerji students also adopted sustainable
practices and commuted to school by cycles and public transportation. In Mumbai,
more than 50 students from Pawar Public School, Kandivali (W) participated in
the rally and spread the message on energy and resource conservation by
encouraging motorists to give up their cars for a day. Speaking on the
initiative, Anil Sardana, Managing Director and CEO, Tata Power said, Tata Power
has always been committed to the cause of saving energy and propagated resource
conservation practices since its inception. Today, being World Car Free Day
gives us the opportunity to take cognizance and actively contribute to the
betterment of the environment. If each member of Indias population which is
nearly 1.3 billion adopts a single sustainable practice in their day to day
life, we can make a huge impact on our carbon footprint! Tata Powers Club Enerji
students have been instrumental in this mission of creating awareness across the
nation. We appreciate the active participation from the students, teachers and
the principal for extending their support to this initiative. Students from
chools such as St. Stephens High school, Phears Rd and Calcutta Boys School, S N
Banergee Rd., Kolkata, Bal Bharti Public School, Rohini, Delhi, S.M. Choksey
School, Pune participated in the initiative. Club Enerji has reached out to over
400 schools in India and has sensitised over 7 million citizens, who in turn
have helped save more than 11.2 MUs of electricity till date. This is equivalent
to saving 11,200 tonnes of CO2, and is enough to light up over 5,200 houses for
a year. The Club also has 1,150 self-sustaining Mini Club Enerjis and has won
several national and international accolades.

Whaleback decision a specific case

BYLINE: J.P. Prince

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 14, Letters To The Editor

LENGTH: 271 words

DATELINE: Calgary, Alta.


   I have a concern with a recent series of Financial Post articles on the
Energy Resources Conservation Board's denial of Amoco Canada Ltd.'s proposed
exploratory gas well in the Whaleback area of southwestern Alberta. The
particular quotes are relatively innocuous, but they fail to reflect the main
message (Lessons on Whaleback, Sept. 14). The message is that the Whaleback
decision, like all decisions of the ERCB, relates to a specific set of
circumstances and facts that were presented to a panel of board members by one
company and a set of intervenors. No generalizations should be taken from such a
decision other than those that are laid out in the decision report.

Your coverage holds an implication that my remarks about lessons to be learned
were primarily intended to be critical of the industry as a whole. The
suggestion is that the ERCB believes the energy industry in Alberta is
ineffective in dealing with the public. To the contrary, the energy sector in
Alberta does a very credible job of communication with the public in most
instances, as evidenced by the fact that only a few hearings are necessary to
resolve thousands of applications each year.

There are, of course, always lessons to be learned from the debate associated
with development in sensitive areas - regardless of the specific decision. But
by focusing on imagined or exaggerated conflict, your articles unfortunately
detracted from the ERCB's efforts to promote better understanding between the
energy industry and the public.

Nova should let go of apron strings

BYLINE: Tamsin Carlisle

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 12, COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 537 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  Nova Corp., the Alberta company that wants to become a world-class
petrochemicals player, has been given a chance to show its mettle in a
head-to-head contest with an established North American industry leader.

Earlier this month, Dow Chemical Canada Inc., the Sarnia, Ont.-based subsidiary
of U.S. giant Dow Chemical Co., announced plans to build an $800-million
ethylene, plastics and chemicals complex near Edmonton.

But it seems that Nova isn't ready to accept the competitive challenge. Instead,
it is lobbying the Alberta government for an ethane policy that would give Nova
preferential access to this vital petrochemical feedstock.

(Ethane is a component of natural gas that can be chemically converted to
ethylene, a building block for plastics such as polyethylene.)

Under the present rules, Nova is guaranteed a low-cost ethane supply for its
existing ethylene plants in Joffre, Alta. It wants the arrangement extended to a
planned $2-billion ethylene and plastics expansion, which it says won't go ahead
unless the province co-operates.

Alberta's gas producers, and now Dow, are vehemently opposed to Nova's demands.
And Alberta's respected Energy Resources Conservation Board has recommended
opening up the ethane market.

CHEAPER FEEDSTOCK

The gas producers' beef stems from their obligation to supply ethane to
extraction plants astride the main provincial gas pipelines - the ''straddle
plants'' that supply Nova. Some producers also extract ethane in the field,
which they are then free to sell to the highest bidder. However, the amount of
ethane they are allowed to extract is limited by the rules protecting Nova's
supply.

Cheap feedstock

The gas producers object to a scheme that would further erode their rights to
extract and market ethane themselves.

Nova argues that cheap feedstock is all that enables Alberta's petrochemicals
industry to compete with Gulf Coast and Great Lakes plants that are closer to
the main world markets for plastics and chemicals.

But with Dow's arrival on the scene, this excuse is wearing thin. It's also
worth noting that Nova has not suggested that Dow be extended the same deal that
it wants for itself.

For its part, Dow says it may have to cancel its Alberta development if Nova
gets first dibs on the province's ethane supply. The Sarnia company has no
intention of ''being left with the bones after somebody else has had the meal.''

Four months after the ERCB's report, Alberta Energy Minister Neil Webber is
still putting off his decision. The delay suggests that Webber is considering
becoming the first Energy minister in 26 years to reject an ERCB recommendation
- a move that would signal that Nova is a favored company in Alberta, and that
other companies wishing to invest in the province's petrochemical industry will
not be offered a level playing field. This could mean that far more than Dow's
project is at stake.

Webber, an eternal optimist, thinks he has a chance of satisfying both Dow and
Nova. However, he should realize that his best chance of securing both projects
may be to refuse to cave in to Nova.

Nova, meanwhile, should loosen its grip on the province's apron strings.

Washington: NSE Hosts Recycling, Energy Conservation Fair

LENGTH: 339  words

DATELINE: Washington


United States Navy, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:

Sailors, families and DoD civilians attended an Energy and Water Conservation
and America Recycles Day Fair held in the Commons at Naval Station Everett
(NSE), Nov. 5.

The fair, designed to bring awareness to recycling, resource conservation and
other environmental issues, included informational booths from companies from
around the Northwest that have ties to energy conservation.

"Every ounce of recycled materials avoids the local landfill," said Lt. Allison
Clarke, assigned to Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. "Not only
does it save Naval Station Everett money, but it also saves energy, which is a
valuable and scarce source these days."

In 2013, NSE was awarded a gold level of achievement by the Secretary of the
Navy (SECNAV) Energy and Water Management Awards indicating an energy program
that ranks between very good and outstanding.

Cmdr. Jeff Caulk, executive officer, Naval Station Everett, spoke at the event
about changes NSE has made to reduce energy usage.

"Naval Station Everett has really been one of the leaders in the region," said
Caulk. "A lot of the light fixtures have been upgraded. We've saved 12 to 16
percent energy usage just with those."

Metro Metals Northwest Inc., was one of many organizations that had a booth at
the event. Various organizations gave out information and performed
demonstrations on resource conservation and recycling.

"More than 6 million pounds of metal come from naval bases in the Northwest,"
said, David Touriel, environmental manager at Metro Metals. "That metal is
reused and turned into fridges, cars and building materials."

This year NSE was awarded the platinum SECNAV Energy and Water Management Award.
Platinum level indicates an outstanding energy program and an exceptional year
for energy project execution. All platinum level commands were also awarded
$5,000.

Washington: NSE Hosts Recycling, Energy Conservation Fair

LENGTH: 339  words

DATELINE: Washington


United States Navy, The Government of USA has issued the following news release:

Sailors, families and DoD civilians attended an Energy and Water Conservation
and America Recycles Day Fair held in the Commons at Naval Station Everett
(NSE), Nov. 5.

The fair, designed to bring awareness to recycling, resource conservation and
other environmental issues, included informational booths from companies from
around the Northwest that have ties to energy conservation.

"Every ounce of recycled materials avoids the local landfill," said Lt. Allison
Clarke, assigned to Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest. "Not only
does it save Naval Station Everett money, but it also saves energy, which is a
valuable and scarce source these days."

In 2013, NSE was awarded a gold level of achievement by the Secretary of the
Navy (SECNAV) Energy and Water Management Awards indicating an energy program
that ranks between very good and outstanding.

Cmdr. Jeff Caulk, executive officer, Naval Station Everett, spoke at the event
about changes NSE has made to reduce energy usage.

"Naval Station Everett has really been one of the leaders in the region," said
Caulk. "A lot of the light fixtures have been upgraded. We've saved 12 to 16
percent energy usage just with those."

Metro Metals Northwest Inc., was one of many organizations that had a booth at
the event. Various organizations gave out information and performed
demonstrations on resource conservation and recycling.

"More than 6 million pounds of metal come from naval bases in the Northwest,"
said, David Touriel, environmental manager at Metro Metals. "That metal is
reused and turned into fridges, cars and building materials."

This year NSE was awarded the platinum SECNAV Energy and Water Management Award.
Platinum level indicates an outstanding energy program and an exceptional year
for energy project execution. All platinum level commands were also awarded
$5,000.

PROVINCE DEFENDS ENVIRONMENT RECORD

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 543 words


'We do have best regulatory framework,' deputy minister insists

The Alberta Energy Department will play a more aggressive role in convincing the
public that provincial environmental reviews are tough enough to protect
sensitive life and land, says the department's top official.

"You'll see more of an advocacy role within the department of energy," deputy
minister David Manning told a Calgary meeting Wednesday.

The rising tide of global environmental concern is a positive move, but
Alberta's policing of the energy industry is unique, Manning said after speaking
to a meeting of the Canadian Energy Institute.

"We do have the best regulatory framework," Manning said, referring to the
recent hearing and approval of Husky Oil Ltd.'s $ 25-million plan to drill five
test wells in Kananaskis Country.

"Moose Mountain demonstrated that environmental groups, no matter how large, how
known, how small, get a good forum. And (they) will continue to have that forum,
and that will never be compromised," Manning said.

"The hearing was proof that, notwithstanding that all the efforts the applicants
had gone through to avoid a hearing, a hearing was called for. And all those
that wanted to be were heard," Manning said.

However, Mike Sawyer of the Rocky Mountain Ecosystem Coalition said in an
interview later that provincial environmental assessments are not sufficient,
and that was proved by restrictions at the Moose Mountain hearing before the
province's Energy Resources Conservation Board.

The ERCB did not force biologists from the Departments of Forestry and Fish and
Wildlife to testify on the environmental impact of Husky's drilling, despite a
request from the coalition to have them there.

"We just want the business of government to be done in the open light of day,"
Sawyer said.

"In this province," he said, "we are in a serious state of denial" that there
are no environmental problems with oil industry practices.

None of more than 200,000 wells drilled to date have ever had an environmental
assessment, which means the effects are unknown, he said.

Manning said his department will play a more active role in convincing critics
that the environment will be protected as petroleum development moves off the
plains and onto the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.

"We have to make sure that the information about our industry and about our
province and the unique physical characteristics about it are known to all who
need to know, to regulators, to politicians, to investors and to
non-governmental organizations."

Sawyer said if the government doesn't start recognizing environmental concerns
soon, the green lobby will increase pressure to shut down natural gas sales to
the lucrative U.S. market.

"We are mustering considerable support for what amounts to an international
boycott of gas," said Sawyer, adding that he'd prefer to avoid such a public and
potentially harmful confrontation.

"We don't have to do all this," he said, if the province would just move to
change industrial practices and put some sensitive land out of bounds for oil
companies.

"We may not succeed in shutting down all of the gas, but . . . if we're
successful to five or 10 per cent, it will have a big impact."

British Land Success at the Sustainable City Awards, London

LENGTH: 214 words


The Sustainable City Awards, now in its 13th year celebrates the UK's foremost
companies in sustainable development and innovation and its scope reflects the
City of London Corporation's interests in driving environmental as well as
business growth.

British Land's success in the Resource Conservation category recognised the
positive steps that the company has made to improve resource conservation
through reducing the consumption of water, gas or electricity.

As one of the largest Real Estate Investment Trusts in the UK, British Land set
a challenging goal to cut energy use in managed properties by 20% by 2012. We
significantly exceeded this, reducing landlord-influenced energy use by 27%
across our entire like-for-like portfolio, compared to 2009. Performance in the
last 12 months has been particularly impressive, almost doubling the 15%
reduction we achieved the year before.

Justin Snoxall, Head of the Business Group said, "We are absolutely delighted to
have won this award as we are passionate about our work in this area and have
achieved much greater landlord- influenced energy reductions than our UK peers.
We are delighted that our reductions have saved occupiers £3.3 million on their
energy bills and cut carbon emissions by 24,500 tonnes over the last three
years."

Bright future seen for renewable energy if research increases;
Conference is told of need to replace fossil fuels

BYLINE: Adam Wilmoth, Business Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 4B

LENGTH: 328 words


Renewable energy sources can provide 25 percent of the country's energy by 2525
if the country continues to increase research into the alternative fuels, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's Gerald Willis said Tuesday.

Speaking before attendees of the "Harvesting Power From the Land" renewable
energy conference at the Meridian Convention Center, Willis said the country is
likely to suffer if renewable fuels soon do not make up a significantly larger
portion of the country's energy supply.

"There doesn't have to be much happen in the Middle East for us to be in trouble
in this country," said Willis, special assistant to the USDA chief. "They'd just
have to cut off oil shipments for 10 days before we'd be in a world of trouble."

Increasing renewable energy sources also will provide a significant economic
advantage, he said.

"At current prices, we're importing about $138 billion a year worth of fossil
fuels from the Middle East, and about 80 cents out of every dollar goes back to
those countries," Willis said. "Do you realize the jobs that could be produced
here in the U.S. if we kept that money here?"

Renewable energy has grown dramatically in the United States over the past five
years, but the "green" fuel still makes up only a tiny portion of the country's
vast energy hunger.

At the end of 2004, about 2 percent of the country's energy came from renewable
sources, Willis said. With the boom in ethanol, biodiesel and wind generation,
however, the number is expected to grow to about 5 percent by the end of 2006.

Larry Wright, resource conservation and development coordinator with USDA's
National Resource and Conservation Service, credited much of the recent growth
to improved technology that has lowered the price of renewable energy at the
same time that world supply and demand have driven up the price of traditional
fossil fuels.

If the price trends continue, the country is likely to increasingly turn toward
alternative fuels, he said.

Harris earns on stock options

Montreal Gazette

MONTREAL -- Air Canada chief executive Hollis Harris pocketed a quick $ 283,424
late last month exercising options on the airline's stock, according to this
week's insider trading reports from the Quebec Securities Commission.

Harris acquired 57,142 shares under option at $ 2.79 each on Nov. 28 and sold
them the same day at $ 7.75 each, the report shows. Harris holds 3,173 shares
and still has 382,099 options, the report states.

Red Deer in canola plant running

RED DEER (CP) -- Red Deer, Camrose and two towns in Saskatchewan are in the
running for a new canola-crushing plant that Cargill Canada Ltd. wants to build,
says the company's president.

A decision on where the plant will be built should be made by mid-January, Kerry
Hawkins said in an interview from Winnipeg. Cargill plans to begin construction
of what Hawkins said will be the largest canola-crushing plant in Western Canada
in the spring.

ERCB ponders gas applications

The Energy Resources Conservation Board says it is considering an application by
Chevron Canada Resources Ltd. of Calgary to ship more than 35 billion cubic feet
of natural gas to Ontario from Alberta over a 15-year period beginning Nov. 1,
1995.

The provincial regulatory board said it has reviewed the reserves supporting the
application and is satisfied Chevron has sufficient gas under its control to
supply the proposed permit. It set Jan. 13 as a deadline for objections to be
filed.

Meanwhile, the ERCB also said it is considering an application by Calgary's
Crestar Energy Inc. to export 16.5 billion cubic feet of gas over seven years to
be sold to Northern States Power Co., a distribution company in Minnesota and
North Dakota.

The board said it is satisfied Crestar has sufficient gas under its control to
supply the proposed permit and requests that objections to the application be
filed by Jan. 11.

Rossdale controversy to get airing first squelched by city council: Provincial
board sets prehearing, hearing with potentially unlimited scope

SOURCE: The Edmonton Journal

BYLINE: Ron Chalmers

SECTION: City; The City; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 639 words

An Alberta Energy and Utilities Board hearing on the Epcor Rossdale plant will
see the public debate that city council has squelched.

The hearing starts at 9 a.m., May 24, at 10055 106th St.

A prehearing meeting at 4 p.m. April 17, at the Royal Glenora Club, will decide
the agenda, process and participants.

The potential scope of this hearing is almost unlimited.

Alberta law empowers the energy board to address all of the same matters that
could be considered by the Energy Resources Conservation Board which, under the
Energy Resources Conservation Act, shall "give consideration to whether the
project is in the public interest, having regard to the social and economic
effects of the project and the effects of the project on the environment."

That's wide open. So here are some issues that could be heard:

Aboriginal burial grounds: Nobody knows whether Epcor land includes part of a
burial ground.

I hope someone will argue, and the energy board will agree, that any excavation
should proceed carefully, and any human remains should be handled respectfully,
in consultation with aboriginal leaders.

Aboriginal camps: The recent finding of an 8,000-year-old stone knife on the
Epcor Rossdale site, preserved by river floodings that deposited silt and mud,
suggests more artifacts may be buried. Archeological digs may tell us more about
this ancient spot.

Epcor has been patient with such exploration, which should continue.

Fort Edmonton: The unearthing of palisade wall remains, from an early Fort
Edmonton or Fort Augustus, proves the value of further digging and mapping.

But nobody -- Epcor, the consulting archeologist or Alberta Community
Development -- has proposed whether these stumps should be removed to a museum
or preserved and displayed on site.

Low-pressure plant: City council has approved the demolition of this historic
building. I would not miss it but others would, and should be able to argue that
the repowering must be refused, because it would require the demolition, or that
it be re-engineered to retain this massive example of industrial architecture.

New plant design: Preliminary drawings by Stantec show a big new building where
the big old low-pressure plant now stands but, unlike the latter, being built on
an east-west axis -- like the existing high-pressure plant.

The design is a clean continuation of the high-pressure plant, whose white south
wall would be re-done in brick or brick-coloured cladding.

We need more information on the material and signage.

Landscaping: Edmonton landscape architect Doug Carlyle has sketched an
attractive plan for more trees, grass and native shrubbery. Also, the trail
would be improved between the plant and the river, separating bicycle and foot
traffic and adding benches and lookouts.

Critics will note that the landscape plan includes green space beside the
proposed new building, which might be reserved as part of a long-term plan for
additional turbines.

Pipeline safety: The hearing also will consider an application by Atco Pipelines
to supply the plant with a new 16-inch natural-gas pipeline from south Edmonton,
running along 103rd Street, then under the river to the plant.

An obvious concern is traffic and business disruption during construction.

Someone also should ask about a recent energy and utilities board report on 200
pipeline-facility inspections, which found 105 facilities to be unsatisfactory,
with 15 being shut down as unsafe.

To be continued: I'm out of space, and still haven't discussed economics, which
Epcor insists is the essential reason for repowering in Rossdale. I'll get to
that soon.

To participate in the prehearing meeting, notify the Energy Resources
Conservation Board in writing by April 12.

ERCB Updates LLR Program to Protect Albertans from Abandonment and Reclamation
Costs

LENGTH: 273  words


New Delhi, March 14 -- The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) has
updated its Licensee Liability Rating (LLR) program to ensure abandonment and
reclamation of oil and gas facilities are covered by industry.



The ERCB requires oil and gas operators to post financial security deposits to
cover the abandonment and reclamation costs of upstream oil and gas wells,
facilities, and pipelines in the event a licensee becomes defunct. Following an
extensive review, the ERCB determined that liability costs must be increased to
minimize financial risk to the Orphan Well Association and to protect Albertans
from the costs to abandon and reclaim upstream oil and gas facilities from
defunct licensees.

Effective May 1, 2013, the ERCB will require 248 licensees to post financial
security of $297 million over a three year period. Licensees may pursue options
to lower the amount of financial security, including transferring licenses,
returning suspended wells to production, or abandoning suspended wells.

The ERCB's Licence Liability Program compares a licensee's assets with its
liabilities; and requires companies to pay a security if liabilities exceed
assets. If a company fails to pay the required security, the ERCB may take
enforcement measures, which include ordering a facility's suspension and
abandonment.

The ERCB is Alberta's primary energy regulator. For almost 75 years we have been
committed to our mission: to ensure that the discovery, development, and
delivery of Alberta's energy resources occur in a fair and responsible manner
that takes into account public safety, environmental protection, and resource
conservation.

Syncrude wins approval to increase production

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 403 words


Environmental concerns must be addressed: ERCB

Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board has approved expansion of the
Syncrude Canada Ltd. operation near Fort McMurray, but warned the oilsands miner
to show more leadership on environmental issues.

The province's petroleum industry regulator said on Monday that Syncrude can
boost its production from 172,000 to 217,000 barrels a day.

That production increase does not require major plant expansion or have a
significant impact on the environment, the board said in a report.

If oil sells for $ 25 a barrel, the expansion will pump another $ 410 million of
revenue a year into Syncrude, the world's largest producer of synthetic crude.

Syncrude, which produces 12 per cent of Canada's crude oil, digs oilsands from
open pit mines and extracts crude from it. But that sand becomes a waste product
requiring disposal.

As part of the application, Syncrude proposed an experimental technique to
dispose of mine tailings by covering them with fresh water in a lake.

"Experiments to date convinced the board the scheme presents limited
environmental risks because it offers the potential to detoxify these tailings
over time," the board said.

Syncrude can develop the disposal lake provided it first builds a large-scale
test lake to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness. It must also continue
researching alternative reclamation and tailings management technologies, the
board said.

The board's hearing into the Syncrude expansion, which lasted 31 days in the
fall of 1993, was one of the longest on record.

Some environmentalists had opposed the expansion, saying it will add to
pollution and greenhouse gases.

The board has called on both Syncrude and the oilsands industry to "assume a
clearer leadership role on environmental issues."

For example, the board expects "Syncrude to improve its ambient air quality,
sulphur disposition and biomonitoring programs through consultation with
regional stakeholders."

This information will be reported to the board to help determine if changes to
emission levels are justified, it said.

Syncrude is allowed to emit up to five tonnes of sulphur dioxide a day, but must
pursue ways to cut those emissions.

Syncrude wanted to expand its mine west of McKay River, but that proposal was
rejected. More information and a separate application will be required, the
board said.

Kitsap, Pierce courthouses compete to cut energy use

BYLINE: Brynn Grimley, Kitsap Sun, Bremerton, Wash.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 814 words


May 14--PORT ORCHARD -- Kitsap County has accepted a challenge from Pierce
County to see who can save the most energy during May.

The challenge will compare energy costs of the county-run courthouse facilities
from May 2012 against May 2013. The government with the highest percentage of
savings is the winner.

The only thing on the line is bragging rights; no other incentives have been
added to sweeten the pot, yet.

But there still is time to come up with a last-minute wager -- like forcing
someone from the losing county to eat rhubarb while the winner enjoys a fresh
salmon dinner, suggested Ryan Dicks, Pierce County's sustainability manager.

Kitsap County Commissioner Charlotte Garrido also hinted at the possibility of
coming up with something near the end of the challenge to entice increased
participation.

Through the challenge, each government is asking courthouse employees to change
their behavior. That means turning off lights before leaving for the day and
making sure things like computer towers, monitors, external speakers and
printers are off when not in use.

A workstation with a flat-screen monitor, computer tower, personal printer and
speakers costs the county $45 a year to run, according to estimates provided by
Autumn Salamack, Kitsap's resource conservation manager.

While that might not seem like a lot, when multiplied by the county's roughly
1,200 computers, it adds up, Salamack said.

Salamack has worked with various departments to increase awareness among
employees about the low-cost and no-cost practices they can incorporate to help
save energy and ultimately save money.

"We wanted to use this challenge with Pierce County as an opportunity to engage
all of the departments and to use this as an opportunity to share information
with the public that we're always working to save energy," Salamack said.

The county has set a goal to reduce energy consumption at its facilities 30
percent by 2020. Since adopting an energy conservation plan in October 2011, the
county has reduced its usage by 11 percent.

The county performed energy audits on some of its buildings to determine how it
will reach its goal. Some things will be easy, like working with employees to be
more energy conscientious, and others will require capital investments to
achieve savings.

Already the county replaced old, inefficient windows in the courthouse at a cost
of $387,472 from federal grants. It also removed lights from rooms that were
overlit. The selective removal saved money and didn't affect visibility.

Salamack sends energy-saving tips to employees through a regular email
newsletter, Garrido said, and works with representatives from different
departments to find efficiencies and keep conservation at the forefront for
employees.

"We've all developed habits over time, and conservation is something we need to
pay attention to," Garrido said. "By having this challenge, it helps us focus
our awareness on some simple ways to make a big difference."

Through the challenge each county is tracking the energy used at its courthouse
facilities. In Kitsap that includes various court departments and the Kitsap
County Sheriff's Office, which is attached to the main building.

The counties are tracking the consumption through energy star, which is a
computer program that looks at electrical and natural gas use, according to
Piece County's Dicks.

Both counties participate in Puget Sound Energy's resource conservation manager
program that brings together conservation managers from different jurisdictions
to discuss cost-saving techniques and share ideas.

Pierce and Kitsap leaders hope the challenge will extend beyond the courthouse
buildings and into the homes of employees and residents.

"It's a good way to educate people about the difference they can make by
sometimes doing simple things like just turning lights off, or turning their
computers off or their monitors off," Dicks said. "Sometimes, it's simple stuff,
but making sure you turn your light off at night makes a big difference."

Breaking down energy costs

Kitsap County resource conservation manager Autumn Salamack measured the amount
of kilowatts used by office equipment commonly found on Kitsap employee desks.

Kitsap County Appoints Panel to Help Spend Energy Conservation Grant

BYLINE: Chris Henry, Kitsap Sun, Bremerton, Wash.

LENGTH: 475 words


Oct. 28--PORT ORCHARD --

The Kitsap County commissioners this week appointed an Energy Conservation
Committee, which will help the county figure out how to use less energy and save
money in the process.

The board on Monday appointed Stephen Douglas of North Kitsap, Michael Kroeger
of Central Kitsap and Sharon Chandler of South Kitsap to serve three-year terms
on the volunteer committee.

Forming the committee is part of a package of energy conservation strategies the
county is implementing using a $2.23 million Department of Energy stimulus
grant.

The grant application outlined a variety of energy-saving endeavors involving
resource conservation, "green" building techniques and promotion of local food
production.

Department of Energy officials on Oct. 19 toured several county facilities that
have been retrofitted to reduce energy consumption through replacement of
lighting, windows, heating and air-conditioning units.

"They were definitely impressed with the amount of work has been done to date,"
said Kitsap County resource conservation manager Autumn Salamack, who
administers the grant.

A total of $926,874, or 42 percent of the grant, has been spent so far. The
retrofitting projects came in under budget. With energy rebates from the
projects, the county has $166,702 left over to apply to other projects.

The commissioners previously approved using $31,250 of that amount for lighting
and heating upgrades at park buildings. On Monday, they approved using the
remainder for lighting upgrades at public works road sheds, estimated to cost
between $52,000 and $79,000. The county will use $35,000 to do energy audits at
county buildings with the greatest potential for savings. Most are older
buildings.

Any money left over from the $166,702 would be applied to retrofitting the
buildings based on recommendations from the audits.

Salamack is collecting data from Puget Sound Energy to document energy savings
over time, which is a condition of the grant.

The other 58 percent of the grant will go to fund green building projects and
encourage local food production. A total of $676,553 will be spent on green
building. Among the proposed local food projects is a revolving loan fund to
help small farmers and other food-related businesses get up and running.

The county must award contracts for all projects by June, 2011. It will have 18
months after that to spend the money, under terms of the grant.

Tata Power Club Enerji spreads awareness on resource conserv

LENGTH: 292 words

DATELINE: India


India, June 14 -- India's largest integrated power firm Tata Power Company Ltd
on Tuesday said its nationwide resource and energy conservation movement Club
Enerji, has been relentlessly spreading awareness about resource conservation
across the country, through its theme of national building.

"Tata Power Club Enerji saves 17.25 million units nationally, sensitises 12.8
million citizens across 11 locations," the company said in a filing to the
Bombay Stock Exchange on June 14, 2016.

In line with this, the Club Enerji movement has successfully achieved a
significant milestone of saving 17.25 million units of electricity by
sensitising more than 12.8 million citizens across 11 locations in Mumbai,
Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Pune, Bangalore, Lonavala, Maithon, Belgaum,
Jamshedpur and Ranchi, it said.

This saving is equivalent to saving 17,000 tons of CO2, which is equivalent to
the amount of energy, it added.

Speaking on the development, Tata Power, CEO & Managing Director, Anil Sardana
said, "We are happy and proud to reach this significant milestone in driving the
message of energy conservation across the country. Tata Power has always been
committed to the cause of saving energy and propagated resource conservation
practices since its inception. I take this opportunity to thank all the
students, schools and our Club Enerji team for supporting Tata Power in its
efforts to save our planet and light up lives for the years to come."

Meanwhile, shares of the company closed flat at Rs 75.75 apiece from previous
close on BSE.

Reserve replacement level hit low in 1992

BYLINE: ROD NUTT; VANSUN

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D3

LENGTH: 272 words


Canadian natural gas producers replaced only a quarter of their production
through reserve additions in 1992 - a combination of booming gas sales and low
drilling activity.

Moreover, the 1992 level of reserve additions was only half that of 1991, itself
a low replacement year, according to a study by the Ziff Energy Group, which
surveyed 30 leading Canadian gas producers holding three-quarters of Canadian
gas reserves.

The Calgary-based energy consulting group attributed the low reserve replacement
in 1992 to record low gas-drilling activity in the year caused by rock-bottom
prices in the first six months.

Gas prices began to surge in the final quarter of 1992 and exploration and
development activity is projected to increase, strengthening the reserve
replacement level.

"The low level of reserve replacement, combined with the sharp decline in the
reserve life index since deregulation, has generated the recent strengthening of
Canadian gas prices through a more balanced supply-demand situation," the Ziff
report said.

In 1992, only 1,072 gas wells were drilled in Western Canada, a 40-per-cent drop
from the 1,792 wells drilled in 1991.

Ziff's estimate of 1992 reserve replacement is one-third of Alberta's Energy
Resources Conservation Board's recently released estimate.

The ERCB's analysis is based on well completion reports submitted by industry
along with periodic analysis of the performance of selected gas pools.

Ziff said its analysis is based on published corporate data, usually scrutinized
by leading petroleum engineering firms.

The ERCB is Alberta's energy regulatory body.

ERCB Contracts Third Party to Conduct Alberta Pipeline Review

LENGTH: 257  words


New Delhi, Sept. 17 -- The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) has
contracted the services of an independent third party to conduct a review of
certain elements of Alberta's pipeline system as announced by the Honourable Ken
Hughes, Minister of Energy on July 20, 2012,

Group 10 Engineering Ltd. (Group 10), of Calgary, Alberta has been awarded the
contract as a result of an open, competitive process which involved a Request
for Proposal (RFP) through the Alberta Purchasing Connection government website.



Group 10 will examine the adequacy of regulatory requirements with respect to
pipelines under ERCB jurisdiction and industry best practices in three areas:
public safety and responses to pipeline incidents, pipeline integrity
management, and safety of pipelines at or near water crossings. The review will
be conducted in addition to the current incident-specific investigations the
ERCB is conducting.

The review is expected to be completed by the end of November and the ERCB will
provide Group 10's final report to the Minister by the end of the year.
Following this, the ERCB will review the Group 10 report and provide its own
report, including resulting ERCB recommendations, if any, to the Minister by
March 31, 2013.

The ERCB's mission is to ensure that the discovery, development and delivery of
Alberta's energy resources take place in a manner that is fair, responsible, and
in the public interest. In assessing the public interest, the ERCB has regard
for public safety, environmental stewardship, and resource conservation.

Sign up now for new Conservation Stewardship Program

BYLINE: The Sundance Times staff

LENGTH: 714  words


The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) began continuous sign-up for the new Conservation Stewardship
Program (CSP) on August 10 in Wyoming. The first cutoff for ranking purposes is
scheduled for Sept. 30, Wyoming NRCS State Conservationist Xavier Montoya
announced last week.

USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) administers CSP, a
voluntary conservation program that encourages agricultural and forestry
producers to maintain existing conservation activities and adopt additional ones
on their operations.

"Wyoming producers have a great opportunity through the CSP to increase their
level of conservation activity," said Montoya. "It is yet another tool to help
protect our land, improve the quality of our soil and water, maintain and
enhance healthy rangelands and habitat, and encourage renewable energy
production."

The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill) authorizes CSP.
Congress renamed and implemented major changes to the former Conservation
Security Program to improve its availability and appeal to agricultural and
forestry producers.

Eligible lands include privately owned cropland, grassland, pastureland,
rangeland, non-industrial private forestland, and agricultural land under the
jurisdiction of an Indian tribe.

Agricultural and forestry producers must submit their applications by Sept. 30
to be considered for funding in the first ranking period.

Individual producers, legal entities and Indian tribes must meet several
requirements to obtain a Conservation Stewardship Program contract. They must be
listed as the operator in the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) farm records
management system for the operation being offered for enrollment. They must
document that they control the land for the term of the contract and include all
eligible land in their entire operation in that contract. They must comply with
highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions and comply with
Adjusted Gross Income provisions.

The program will be offered to producers nationwide and the Pacific and
Caribbean areas through continuous sign-ups. Congress capped the acreage
enrollment at 12,769,000 acres for each fiscal year. The annual payment
limitation for a person or legal entity is $40,000. A person or legal entity
cannot exceed $200,000 for all contracts entered into during any five-year
period.

"I strongly encourage Wyoming folks who may be interested in the program to use
the self-screening checklist as the first step to determine whether this new
program is suitable for their operation," Montoya said. "This checklist is
available on the NRCS Web site and at NRCS field offices."

Once a potential participant has determined program suitability, the next step
is for an NRCS conservationist and the producer to jointly enter the producer's
current and proposed conservation practices into the conservation measurement
tool (CMT). The CMT tool estimates the level of environmental performance
achieved by the maintenance and implementation of conservation activities. The
conservation performance estimated by the CMT will be used to rank applications.

Wyoming has designated five CSP geographic areas. Applications will be ranked
within each geographic area (not statewide or nationwide) as follows: Central
(Albany, Carbon, Converse, and Natrona counties); Northeast (Campbell, Crook,
Johnson, Sheridan, and Weston counties); Northwest (Big Horn, Fremont, Hot
Springs, Park, and Washakie counties); Southeast (Goshen, Laramie, Niobrara, and
Platte counties); and Southwest (Lincoln, Sublette, Sweetwater, Teton, and Uinta
counties).

Agency field staff also will conduct on-site field verifications of applicants'
information obtained from the CMT for applicants approved for funding. Once the
potential application has been field verified, the producer must develop a
conservation stewardship plan as part of his/her program contract.

For additional information about CSP, including eligibility requirements and the
interim final rule, please visit www.nrcs.usda.gov/new_csp or visit your local
NRCS field office.

USDA is finalizing the program's policies and procedures. The CSP interim final
rule, published in the Federal Register, is open for public comment through
Sept. 28.

EUB has served Albertans well over 70 years, ex-chairmen say

BYLINE: G.W. Govier, G.J. DeSorcy and M.N. McCrank, The Edmonton Journal

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A18

LENGTH: 690  words


We three former chairmen of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB), and
its predecessor, the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), do not defend
the decision of the EUB to hire a private investigating agency to carry out
covert activities resulting in the invasion of people's privacy. That decision
was clearly wrong, as has already been determined by the privacy commissioner
and a Queen's Bench justice.

However, it is clear from the investigations that there were security concerns
that the EUB had to address in the interests of "public safety."

The privacy commissioner's report states in paragraph 47:

"In my view, the EUB's concerns about safety and security at the Rimbey
proceedings are understandable. ... Where there is sufficient anger to make
physical contact, it creates an unpredictable situation where it is reasonable
for the EUB to review its security arrangements."

The justice of the Queen's Bench states in referring to the hearing on April 16,
2007:

"At some point a scuffle, captured by a TV camera, occurred with a gentleman
shoving a staff member of the EUB. Constant interruption punctuated the efforts
of the panel to conduct the hearing. After adjourning until the next day,
matters continued in the same vein. Legal counsel speaking to the panel
characterized the proceedings as 'dysfunctional' and 'exceptional not for the
right reasons.'

"Others characterized the hearings as having descended into 'chaos,' with a lack
of respect for the process. Swearing and pejorative epithets were cast at panel
members and ultimately the panel adjourned on April 18, 2007."

Some of the issues raised at the hearings brought emotional responses and
conduct of the proceedings was not easy. When unruliness led to physical action
and risk to public safety, the EUB had to act. We firmly believe that the action
taken (to hire an investigating agency) was taken solely in the interest of
protecting personal and public safety with no intent of invading personal
privacy.

All Albertans have the right to expect public hearings, like court proceedings,
to be held with order and dignity in facilities and under circumstances that are
safe. They also have the right of protection of their privacy and the EUB made a
serious error in judgment, not in acting, but in the way it chose to act.

Even so, we believe the decision to try to ensure public safety was made
honestly and in the public interest.

The privacy commissioner and the justice have made recommendations to ensure
that such an action will not reoccur. We understand that all the recommendations
have been accepted and are being acted upon by the EUB.

Earlier on, the government announced that it would separate the responsibilities
of the EUB relating to the development, production, processing, and
transportation of energy resources from those dealing with public utilities. We
support this and we believe it will lead to more efficient operations in both
areas.

The question remaining is should the EUB be "punished", "overhauled" or
"dismantled"? Is it a "beast" that needs to be "tamed"?

We believe that Albertans have been served well for some 70 years with
dedication, competence and complete honesty by the EUB and its predecessor
organizations. These bodies have been responsible for the orderly and most
successful development of our energy resources. They have been held up as a
model throughout many parts of the world.

We are not saying that the EUB is perfect, but rather that it is a fine
organization doing an honest job of ensuring that Alberta's energy resources are
developed in an orderly and efficient manner in the public interest. It has made
a mistake which will not happen again. The EUB deserves our understanding, our
confidence and our respect.

We urge all who have a stake in this issue to reflect carefully. The
discrediting of a venerable institution is not, in our opinion, in the interest
of any of us.

concerned over an Amoco plan to drill in an environmentally sensitive region
south of the city -- is upset it has been denied funding to get expert opinion
on the impact.

Wendy Francis, of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, says her group has
concerns about the proposal to drill a well in the Whaleback area, 120
kilometres south of Calgary.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board will hold a public hearing into the
proposal April 25.

The board rejected an application for funding and instead decided to limit
financial assistance to those who reside in the area and have concerns.

But Francis told a news conference Tuesday her group is considering appealing
the board's decision.

But ERCB spokesman Peter Kinnear said Amoco's proposal is for an exploratory
well, adding it's premature to go into broad ecosystem effects or cumulative
impact assessments in a big way.

The board tried to "judiciously" narrow the scope of the hearing while still
allowing for some comment, Kinnear said.

First-timers may revive market

SECTION: NEW IN HOMES; Pg. H04

LENGTH: 287 words


First-time homebuyers could lead a rebound in Canada's real estate market,
thanks to lower prices and shifting demographics.

Phil Soper of Brookfield Real Estate Services says a combination of factors are
attracting first-time buyers back to the market after they checked out in large
numbers at the end of 2008.

National average home prices were down 11 per cent in January compared to a year
earlier.

Soper says this, along with historically low mortgage rates and a buyers'
market, are working to attract first-time buyers.

Soper and Warren were speaking in Toronto as part of Scotiabank's annual real
estate conference.

The Ontario Home Builders' Association has thrown its support behind the
provincial government's plan to require energy audits on homes for sale.

"This is a positive step forward to ensure that homebuyers are more fully
informed about the energy use of the home they are considering for purchase,"
said OHBA president Frank Giannone.

"New homes are already bound by requirements in the Ontario Building Code for
minimum insulation levels and resource conservation, so new homebuyers can be
assured they are purchasing a high performance home."

Giannone noted there are 4.8 million existing homes in the province's housing
stock that would ultimately benefit from an energy audit and energy
improvements.

The OHBA says the time has come for more clarity and disclosure for consumers
and is calling for energy audits on all classes of buildings for sale, not just
residential.

"Traditionally the government has relied on the new home construction industry
to implement energy and resource conservation policy," said Giannone. "It's time
to look to all sectors to improve their carbon footprint."

The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board said Tuesday it will act on a
report on health and environmental effects of sour gas development and push to
ensure the industry is committed to ongoing communication with the public.

"The ERCB agrees with the recommendation that sour gas facility operators should
be expected to provide comprehensive information about sour gas," the board said
in a release.

"Various means that the ERCB has at its disposal to ensure effective
communication occurs will be reviewed and we will work with industry to develop
a framework for consistent expections."

The ERCB, which monitors oil and gas development for the province, responded to
an advisory committee report that reviewed public safety issues surrounding sour
gas. The issues involved include emergency response, prevention of accidents,
development and communications.

FARMERS AND OILMEN SHOULD BE FRIENDS

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 598 words


Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board warmed up its chilly relationship
with the agricultural community when it appeared to side with a Provost dairy
farmer in his longstanding dispute with the oil company sharing his land.

There is reason to believe that the case could mark the beginning of a closer,
more productive working relationship between Alberta's most important and most
competitive industries.

That's good, because when people are competing to make the same patch of land
produce more with less investment of effort and money, they should at least
agree on the mechanism for settling the disputes that inevitably arise.

For some time the Alberta Cattle Commission has complained that the ERCB seems
to consistently favor the oil industry when wells, production batteries and
pipelines compete with livestock and humans to exploit the natural wealth of
Alberta's land.

Early this year, a resolution passed at the commission's annual general meeting
called for Alberta Environment to take over the job of investigating and
adjudicating farmer's complaints that oil installations endanger livestock,
pollute the land and, perhaps, underground aquifers.

Such a drastic move could only worsen the situation. The ERCB is clearly the
only government agency with the expertise and the experience necessary to
evaluate the impact of oil and gas development on farms. Setting up a parallel
system under Alberta Environment would be an egregious waste of money and not
guarantee farmers any better results.

Cattle Commission spokeswoman Marjorie Mann says the resolution is still more a
warning than official policy, but that could change once a research project
looking into the effects of oil and gas emissions on livestock is completed.

The ERCB's recent decision to severely restrict drilling by Amax Petroleum Ltd.
on Cy Skinner's dairy farm did not give much satisfaction to farmers bent on
establishing that livestock are harmed by errant oil and gas emissions. But it
did provide a clear indication that the board is listening to concerns.

The board acknowledged there had been numerous leaks from the battery that
separates water and gas from the oil pumped from 26 of the 37 Amax wells located
on the Skinner dairy farm. Release hatches on top of gas storage tanks didn't
always seal properly resulting in unplanned emissions. And the flare stack
design caused exhaust to travel down the stack to ground level in high winds.

But, although the gas was sour, the relatively low concentrations of hydrogen
sulphide (41/2 per cent) were not sufficient to endanger humans or animals,
according to the ERCB. Other evidence relating to contamination of the aquifer
was deemed to be largely circumstantial and inconclusive.

Nonetheless, the ERCB did find that the noise, smell and general crowding caused
by the numerous wells and poorly functioning oil production battery was
incompatible with the Skinner dairy operation. It ordered the offending battery
closed and that new wells be drilled horizontally from the edge of the farm.

The decision is significant to farmers because it gives equal weight to
agricultural production as an economic activity along side oil production and
priority to preserving the farming lifestyle of the Skinner family.

It should help ease the simmering conflicts and open the door to more reasoned
negotiations especially in central Alberta where both farmers and oil companies
are under great pressure to intensively exploit the land and it's not unusual to
have as many as 60 wells on a single section.

   EDMONTON (CP) - Alberta oil producers, for the first time in 16 months, will
be allowed to sell all they can produce.

The province's Energy Resources Conservation Board said it will raise its
allowable production figures today, resulting in full production.

The change results from increased demand by Interprovincial Pipe Line, a reduced
supply from the Suncor oil sands plant and diversion of some gas liquids to the
Cochin pipeline, the board said in a news release Friday.

The board set an allowable production of 653,000 barrels of crude oil a day last
March.

Province urged to define special areas

BYLINE: VICKI BARNETT

SECTION: CITY & LIFE; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 448 words


Guidelines will resolve conflict in future, says Locke

It's time for the provincial government to identify which areas of Alberta will
be protected and which are open for drilling, a lawyer in the controversial
Whaleback case says.

"Until the government gets off its duff and comes to grips with this, we're not
going to be able to solve problems (that lead to environmentalists and
developers locking horns)," lawyer Harvey Locke said Friday.

Locke successfully represented environmental groups in their fight against a
well proposed in the environmentally sensitive Whaleback.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB), in rejecting Amoco Canada
Petroleum's application to drill an exploratory well in the area, said Thursday:
"The board concurs with the views expressed that the Whaleback area is a
valuable representation of an ecologically unique portion of the province.

"The board accepts that it is the largest such area in the province still
remaining in a relatively undisturbed condition and, as such, would likely be a
prime candidate for consideration by the Special Places 2000 program."

Environmentalists fear the government commitment to implement the program is
weakening under pressure from groups such as off-road-vehicle drivers. Locke
urged the government to proceed with Special Places 2000, a framework for
setting aside a network of protected areas in the province.

Locke said the ERCB's new mandate since September, 1993, has been to take into
account social, economic and environmental effects of a project decision -- and
that paved the way for the Whaleback decision.

"The board took its new mandate seriously," said Locke, who anticipates it will
continue to do so in the future.

Jim Prentice -- lawyer for residents in the Whaleback area 120 kilometers south
of Calgary who were opposing the development -- said, "It's a watershed decision
in terms of the board assuming its environmental jurisdiction."

Liberal environment critic Bruce Collingwood added, "The ERCB seems to be crying
out for direction from government on the Special Places 20000 initiative."

The Herald could not reach Environment Minister Brian Evans for comment either
Thursday or Friday.

In its written remarks, the board said, "Once a decision has been made under the
Special Places 2000 program for the region, the board would be willing to
reconsider an application by Amoco under the terms defined for the area."

Amoco external affairs manager Vince Rodych said in an earlier interview, "It is
unfortunate that Amoco had no advance indication that the board would be unable
to adjudicate this matter until the protected area is resolved."

HUNTER CREEK HEARING POSTPONED

BYLINE: HERALD STAFF

LENGTH: 128 words


The provincial Energy Resources Conservation Board has postponed until May 16 a
hearing on Amoco Canada Petroleum Co.'s application to drill an exploration well
in the Hunter Creek region of southwestern Alberta, north of Maycroft.

A number of groups hoping to make presentations were not ready, said Simone
Marler, a board spokeswoman.

The hearing, set for the Maycroft community hall, was originally scheduled for
next Monday. The deadline for written submissions to the board has also been
extended, until May 2.

Amoco expects Hunter Creek could hold 1.2 trillion cubic feet of deadly sour
natural gas. The project could create 1,500 jobs to the year 2014. But the
unproven exploration project has attracted protest from environmental groups.

Free trade deal will not alter energy constants

BYLINE: Frank Dabbs

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 23, OIL PATCH

LENGTH: 938 words

DATELINE: Calgary,Alta.


  In the 36 years since Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board first
approved natural gas removal from the province to Canadian and U.S. markets,
there have been two constants to its decisions.

First, it has protected long-term reserves required by Alberta consumers. The
principle has always been that Albertans own the province's resources and have
first call on them.

Second, the ERCB has maintained the reliability and credibility of Alberta gas
supply. Sign a long-term contract for Alberta gas and you can count on delivery
without question for the life of the deal.

And the advent of deregulation in the mid-1980s has not changed either of those
fundamentals.

Since 1973, the province has insisted on the price of its gas (and oil) being to
the satisfaction of the Alberta government. The justification is that the
government is protecting the interests of Albertans as the resource owners - and
must be willing sellers in a free market.

CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS

Successive Alberta energy ministers and cabinets have added only one basic tenet
to the regulatory doctrine.

In 1953, Calgary North MP Carl Nickle described the fledgling gas market as
''(an) unhappy mixture of resource with scads of promoters, politicians,
flagwavers, misinformation and common sense.''

Not much has changed. However, it is still possible to unscramble much of the
confusion and mystery of the system simply by going back to the first principles
that govern ERCB and Alberta cabinet regulatory decisions .

Three times in 1988 the constants established in 1952 and 1973 have served to
explain apparently controversial gas market decisions made in Alberta.

Ontario consumers, gas distribution utilities and Ontario Energy Minister Robert
Wong have been frustrated by Alberta's interpretation of gas market
deregulation.

Manitobans and Quebecers share the reaction.

The concept of locking the core consumer market of essential-service customers
into long-term contracts seems to contradict open access between producers and
buyers.

When Alberta Energy Minister Neil Webber refuses to issue removal permits for
discount gas sales from independent brokers direct to core market buyers, it
looks suspiciously like re-regulation of the market.

Consumers quite reasonably ask: what is so unreasonable about Wong's alternative
of a portfolio of spot-sale and both medium and long-term contracts?

The answer comes in two parts.

First, Alberta cannot guarantee the reliability of deliveries to
essential-service customers under some of the imaginative supply arrangements
worked out by some brokers.

Second, the province is not a willing seller of its resource at some of the
proposed prices.

Some of those prices are so low they guarantee financial hardship for producers
and impair consumer interests by assuring the failure of reserve-replacement
economics.

As the universe unfolds, local distribution companies have apparently gotten the
message and are signing up to Western Gas Marketing Ltd. supply contracts that
create, in private deals, a core market.

This year has also produced politically generated panic over the future domestic
supply of Canadian natural gas energy under the Canada-U.S. free trade
agreement.

For the Alberta government and its regulators, the issue of domestic energy
security under the free trade agreement is a non-starter.

They find the notion that the deal sells out Canadian energy sovreignty
frustrating and provocative.

They regard the energy provinces, not Ottawa, as the toughest line of defence
for Canadian energy interests.

They have read the free trade agreement and it does not compromise their
authority to protect those interests.

There is no attack on, or disruption of, Alberta's constitutional ownership and
control of its energy resources.

And any Canadian who thinks or fears that, under the free trade pact, Alberta
will allow U.S. interests to undermine the regulatory process here, has not been
keeping up with recent ERCB and cabinet decisions.

Today's essentially free, cross-border natural gas market will not be altered by
the implementation of the trade deal.

The long-term contracts that Alberta has insisted upon at the core of the
Canadian domestic market are unassailable.

CONSISTENT SIGNAL

If U.S. consumers want access to Alberta gas, they had better be prepared to
sign the same kind of long-term deals at prices and conditions that suit
Canadian interests.

In its most recent decision, the ERCB sent precisely that signal to the
lucrative California market.

Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., a marketing agency owned 50% by Alberta Energy Co. Ltd.
and 50% by Nova Corp., applied to the ERCB for a removal permit to extend a
major contract for 25 years.

It proposed to back the extension for the first time with probable as well as
proven gas reserves.

The ERCB gave Pan-Alberta only half a loaf.

It refused to alter its policy that gas export contracts be for no longer than
15 years and it refused to alter its policy that only proven gas reserves be
contracted out.


Pan-Alberta is a blue-chip marketer and exporter and the blue-chip boys in
Alberta are in the habit of getting their way. So it was privately stunned as
well as publically disappointed by the decision.

Out of deference to Pan-Alberta's stature and the realities of an
increasingly-competitive market, the ERCB will review its removal permit
policies over the next year.

A wise person should not expect a compromise on the long-standing principles of
prudence behind those policies.

Esso receives okay to expand heavy oil plant

LENGTH: 161 words

DATELINE: EDMONTON


   EDMONTON (CP) - The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board has granted
approval for a $400 million expansion at Esso Resources' heavy oil project at
Cold Lake.

Esso spokesman Kent O'Connor said the company anticipates provincial cabinet
approval as well. But he added that expansion work at the project will not begin
before next year.

The board recommended Esso be given until 1989 to start construction on stages
seven through 10 of the Cold Lake project.

A proposed 1986 start of construction was halted because of low oil prices and
uncertainty about future price directions, said O'Connor.

He said the extension allows sufficient flexibility for detailed planning of the
expansion to go ahead. The major change is that the work will be done in-house
rather than farmed out to contractors as in the past.

Building of an expensive upgrader was delayed, with the initial focus to be on
heavy oil for sale immediately in the U.S.

The Energy Resources Conservation Board will hold a hearing Jan. 24 into Husky
Oil's application to drill five wells near Moose Mountain.

The board made the decision following a pre-hearing meeting in December to
consider the need for, and scope of, a hearing. Environmental activist Mike
Sawyer of the Rocky Mountain Ecosystem Coalition said he's pleased the board
gave his group and other opponents of the project an extra two weeks to prepare
for the hearing.

Hearings into well licence applications are unusual, with the ERCB holding only

Official urges OK of 2007 Farm Bill

BYLINE: NOK-NOI RICKER OF THE NEWS STAFF

SECTION: Pg. B1

LENGTH: 626 words

DATELINE: BANGOR


Mark Rey, the under secretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest
Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service, was in town Thursday telling
residents that Congress needs to pass the 2007 Farm Bill this year.

Benefits for Maine are at stake, he said. If the bill is not passed, Congress
will have two choices - revert to policies written in 1949, which is very
unlikely, Rey said, or extend the 2002 Farm Bill by five years.

"That would be an unfortunate development for Maine," Rey said, "because all we
put in it [the 2007 Farm Bill] for conservation would be lost."

Rey was the keynote speaker at the annual USDA State Technical Committee
meeting, held at the Spectacular Event Center, where he gave a quick overview of
the 2007 Farm Bill that his department presented to Congress in January.

That draft "increases spending for improved farm programs [and is] within
deficit reduction targets," he said. It also made "common sense reforms to the
commodities program" that eliminated supplemental checks for farmers who gross
more than $200,000 and tied those checks to the farm revenues, instead of the
commodities' price.

"We believe these programs are vital programs ... but we do believe they should
be significantly reformed," Rey said.

Rey's draft also increases conservation programs by nearly $8 billion, sets
aside funds for specialty crops, including organic and locally grown items, and
includes funds to assist new and beginning farmers. It also contained provisions
for investments of more than $1 billion in renewable energy, including biofuels
and corn-based ethanol, over the next decade.

"Today, we're on the verge of marketing renewable energy [such as] cellulosic
ethanol," Rey said.

Cellulosic ethanol is a renewable energy because it's made basically from waste
products such as wood chips. The University of Maine is working on refining this
technology.

The U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives have taken that draft bill and
created versions of their own that generally leave the commodities program
alone, which in turn means there is less money for the other programs, Rey said.

Both the House and Senate farm bills actually ask for increased taxes, and use
"budget gimmicks" to create misleading figures, he said.

"Who do they think they're fooling?" Rey asked the Bangor gathering.

Both versions of the House and Senate farm bills leave research funding figures
alone, he said.

The Senate should begin to deliberate the 2007 Farm Bill this week or next, he
said. The House of Representatives passed its $286 billion version of the bill
on July 27, which "makes historic investments in fruit and vegetable production,
conservation, nutrition and renewable energy while maintaining a strong safety
net for America's farmers," the House agriculture committee Web site states.

Rey said the Bush administration has vowed to veto both the Senate and House
versions in their current forms, saying they are too costly to taxpayers and
would pay wealthy farmers too much in subsidies.

During the daylong conference, hosted by the state's Natural Resources
Conservation Service, 13 groups and organization, all recent NRCS grant
recipients, gave short presentations about their projects.

The group included the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife,
Wildlife Management Institute, Trust to Conserve Northeast Forestlands, Greater
Lovell Land Trust, Time and Tide Resource Conservation and Development, Project
SHARE, Heart of Maine Resource Conservation and Development, Kennebec County
Soil and Water Conservation District, Resources First Foundation, University of
Maine, Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, Androscoggin Valley Soil
and Water Conservation District, and the Community Energy Partners LLC.

Driving Energy Efficiency in City Buildings

LENGTH: 344  words

DATELINE: New York



 Seattle: City of Seattle, The State of Washington has issued the following news
release:



  OSE and the City's capital departments are working to shrink our energy use
and reduce GHG emissions in City-owned facilities. Seattle's Resource
Conservation Management work is a fairly technical body of work but absolutely
critical in terms of leading the way to meeting the Citywide goal for an 82%
reduction in building-related GHG emissions by 2050. The aim of our Resource
Conservation Management program is to ensure that our city-owned buildings are
operating as efficiently as possible, with a near-term target to achieve a 20%
reduction in energy use by 2020. Long-term this puts us on the path to
significantly reducing the GHG emissions of the City-owned building portfolio.





 OSE works across City departments to identify and implement priority energy
efficiency projects that complement the efforts of individual departments and
that accelerate progress toward greater effiency and reduced GHG emissions. This
focused efficiency work means that we are on track towards meeting our 20%
energy reduction goal. From 2008 through 2015 we have achieved a nearly 9%
reduction in energy use across the City's buildings, which corresponds to a 15%
reduction in our building related carbon emissions in that same timeframe.



 In 2017-2018, we will be continuing dedicated efforts to improve efficiency and
reduce emissions through the following actions:



     Building tune-ups: operational improvements for our largest buildings. This
work is part of our commitment to complete mandated Building Tune-Ups in advance
of the compliance deadlines for the private market. Those over 200,000 square
feet are under way and due to be completed by October 2017.

     Parking Garage LED lighting upgrades

     Building Stairwell LED lighting upgrades

     Advanced Rooftop Unit Control upgrades, and

     Comprehensive energy upgrades at 10 individual buildings.

Syncrude gets approval to expand oilsands mining; But don't neglect the
environment, Alberta regulatory panel warns

BYLINE: ALAN BORAS; CALGARY HERALD

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D8

LENGTH: 396 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board has approved expansion of the
Syncrude Canada Ltd. operation near Fort McMurray, but warned the oilsands miner
to show more leadership on environmental issues.

The board, which regulates the province's petroleum industry, said yesterday
that Syncrude can increase its production from 172,000 to 217,000 barrels a day.

That production increase does not require major plant expansion or significantly
affect the environment, the board said.

If oil sells for $ 25 a barrel, the expansion will pump another $ 410 million of
revenue a year into Syncrude, the world's largest producer of synthetic crude.

Syncrude, which produces 12 per cent of Canada's crude oil, digs into the
oilsands from open-pit mines and extracts crude from it. But that sand becomes a
waste product requiring disposal.

As part of the application, Syncrude proposed an experimental technique to
dispose of mine tailings by covering them with fresh water in a lake.

"Experiments to date convinced the board the scheme presents limited
environmental risks because it offers the potential to detoxify these tailings
over time," the board said.

Syncrude can develop the disposal lake provided it first builds a large-scale
test lake to demonstrate the technique's effectiveness.

It must also continue researching alternative reclamation and
tailings-management technologies, the board said.

The board's hearing into this expansion, which lasted 31 days in autumn 1993,
was one of the longest on record.

Some environmentalists opposed the expansion, saying it will add to pollution
and greenhouse gases.

The board has called on both Syncrude and the oilsands industry to "assume a
clearer leadership role on environmental issues."

For example, the board said it expects Syncrude "to improve its ambient air
quality, sulphur disposition and biomonitoring programs through consultation
with regional stakeholders."

This information will be reported to the board to help determine if changes to
emission levels are justified, the board said.

Syncrude is allowed to emit up to five tonnes of sulphur dioxide a day, but must
pursue ways to cut those emissions.

Syncrude wanted to expand its mine west of McKay River, Alta., but that proposal
was rejected. More information and a separate application will be required, the
board said.

Residents: Conserve power;
Interest in conservation programs tops city survey results

BYLINE: Ryan Morgan Camera Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 419 words


Want an audit?

What: Home energy audits, which show owners where they use the most energy and
how to save it.

How to get one: Call the Center for Resource Conservation at 303-441-3278, ext.
24, to arrange an audit.

Quiet, uncongested streets are well and good. Parks are important, sure, as are
acquiring open space and a low crime rate.

But when it comes to making the quality of life better in Boulder, all of those
things pale in comparison to the city of Boulder doing more to provide "energy
conservation and efficiency programs," residents reported in a 2007 survey, the
results of which were released last week.

The city has sent out a survey to take residents' temperature on a wide range of
issues for the past 20 years, but this is the first time energy conservation was
included as a category.

It dominated traditional quality-of-life categories: 57 percent of the survey's
respondents said they consider energy-efficiency programs "very important." The
next-highest-scoring category, "reducing traffic," was endorsed by 46 percent of
respondents as being very important.

And when asked to rank potential improvements to Boulder's quality of life on a
100-point scale, conservation programs again dominated, scoring a 79, with
"reducing traffic" once again in second place, with 73.

Keith Desrosiers is executive director of the Center for Resource Conservation,
which provides home-energy audits that are subsidized by many cities in Boulder
County. He said he's not surprised at the survey's results.

"There's been a ground swell of interest in the program. In December, we had to
stop taking reservations" because demand got so high, he said. "People just seem
very interested in how they can make meaningful changes in their life when it
comes to sustainability."

Desrosiers said he thinks programs like energy audits -- in which experts walk
homeowners through simple steps they can take to reduce their energy use -- give
people a hands-on way of tackling the vast problem of climate change.

"In Boulder, we give people the opportunity to participate in meaningful ways,"
he said. "It's something that's practical, and so it becomes meaningful."

And those sentiments clearly extend beyond the city's boundaries. Roland Crabbe,
a Lafayette resident who had an audit on Monday, said getting an audit makes
sense financially -- the up-front costs of many improvements will pay off over
time -- and morally.

"I think it shows just how responsible people are in Boulder," he said. "They
want to do the right thing."

ERCB Improves Public Access to Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid Information
FracFocus.ca Coming Soon to Alberta

LENGTH: 320  words


New Delhi, Dec. 23 -- Albertans will soon have online access to information on
the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations through the FracFocus website
(www.fracfocus.ca).

The Energy Resources Conservation Board's (ERCB) Directive 059: Well Drilling
and Completion Data Filing Requirements has been updated to enhance reporting
requirements for fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations. These changes
support the ERCB's commitment to the open disclosure of fracture fluids and
align with the Government of Alberta's focus on improved transparency in support
of responsible development.



The enhanced reporting requirements will be effective as of December 31, 2012,
and will be mandatory for all hydraulic fracturing operations going forward.
Albertans will begin to see increasing amounts of information on FracFocus by
summer of 2013 as data from newly drilled and completed wells is reported under
the new reporting rules.

As with all of its regulations, the ERCB will regularly review the directive to
ensure it continues to meet its objectives. For a copy of Directive 059, visit
www.ercb.ca.

FracFocus.ca has been implemented by the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission
to facilitate the disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluid information in
Canadian jurisdictions. Adoption of the site supports Alberta's participation in
the New West Partnership. FracFocus.ca is based on FracFocus.org, a site
developed in the United States by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission
and Groundwater Protection Council.

The ERCB is Alberta's primary energy regulator. For almost 75 years, the ERCB
has been committed to its mission: to ensure the discovery, development, and
delivery of Alberta's energy resources take place in a manner that is fair,
responsible, and in the public interest. In assessing public interest, the ERCB
has regard for public safety, environmental stewardship, and resource
conservation.

Nice scenery won't put food on the table

BYLINE: DAVID YAGER, FREELANCE WRITER

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 656 words


The relentless economic destruction of Canada continued last week when Alberta's
Energy Resources Conservation Board announced that Amoco Petroleum will not be
permitted to explore a new, large deposit of natural gas in an area called
Whaleback, about 150 kilometres south of Calgary.

The protectionist movement, which had fought hard to prevent development, was
"overjoyed" that the ERCB denied Amoco a drilling licence. In order to preserve
this allegedly unique piece of land, the ERCB declared exploration at Whaleback
was "not in the public interest."

Harvey Locke, the lawyer who represented Amoco's opponents and a regular
spokesman for zero development in the mountains of southwest Alberta, told a
reporter: "This decision is of tremendous significance. It means the border
interests of the public and the environment are finally being taken into
account."

And what precisely are "the border interests of the public," when industrial
development and environmental protection collide? Who really speaks for the
so-called silent majority? While everyone in the Whaleback decision claimed to
be acting in the public interest, in fact the public is rarely consulted. Land
use battles are almost always fought between small but vocal special-interest
groups, private companies, and public employees. The public always finds out how
well their interests have been served after the fact.

But if you did ask the public what it wanted to do with Whaleback, and all the
issues were clear and on the table, my guess is the road to the site would
already be under construction.

The economic argument to pursue careful but continuous resource development
instead of absolute preservation is very compelling in the 1990s. This fact is
well known to Canada's 1.5 million unemployed and millions more who wonder if
they'll still have a job a year from now.

Before the environmentalists who fought Amoco's development uncork another
bottle of taxpayer-subsidized champagne, let's understand what the Whaleback
decision really cost.

In 1992 and 1993 Amoco leased from the Alberta government the mineral rights to
explore for gas on 61 sections of Crown land at Whaleback for $ 1.6 million. But
before Amoco could drill, it had to seek final approval from the ERCB. For many
wells this process can take as little as 24 hours.

Unfortunately for Amoco, its leases were in a visually attractive stretch of
mountainous terrain within two hours of downtown Calgary, an easy target for
Alberta's well-organized and largely urban protectionist interests. For years
these organizations have been fighting hard to have the ERCB turn down a
development application of any kind.

Amoco's opponents were ecstatic.

This decision is very significant. The reason the ERCB has been saying Yes for
so long is that until Whaleback, nobody every considered it was not in public
interest to continue to develop the resource wealth that has made Alberta one of
the best places to live in the world.

But for how long? Turning down Whaleback cost the economy a fortune. Amoco
figures its leases could hold a lot of gas.

Development alone would cost $ 1.2 billion over the next 35 years.

Amoco figures that the region of Whaleback could hold enough marketable
resources to pay Edmonton $ 900 million in royalties and up $ 2 billion in total
taxes in the next 35 years. This is enough money to service and eventually
eliminate $ 1 billion or three per cent of Alberta's long-term debt, saving each
taxpayer $ 1,000 in the next three decades.

In the next 10 years, Amoco calculated the project could create 1,500 jobs per
year and add billions to Alberta's economy.

Maybe now when the economically disadvantaged need food because their UI has
expired or because of more social service cutbacks, they can take a pretty
picture of Whaleback to a grocery store and trade it for something to eat.

PEIGAN BAND, AMOCO SIGN DEAL

LENGTH: 492 words


'Nominal fee' for drilling in Whaleback area

Amoco Canada called a news conference Friday to announce a deal with the Peigan
Indians -- then refused to say what the band will receive.

"There's nothing in the agreement that's of a secretive nature," insisted Peigan
Chief Leonard Bastien, while refusing to release any details. The agreement
relates to Amoco's plans to drill an exploratory well in traditional Peigan
territory in the Whaleback, an environmentally sensitive area 120 kilometres
south of Calgary.

(The company's plan has been vehemently opposed by environmentalists and local
residents, and was the subject of an Energy Resources Conservation Board hearing
earlier this month. The ERCB hasn't yet made a decision on the well.)

Bastien insisted the Peigan received only a nominal fee from Amoco. "It's
nothing that's going to raise any eyebrows," he said.

Cliff Wallis, president of the Alberta Wilderness Association which is opposing
Amoco's plans, said, "The whole thing shows how desperate Amoco is to get some
good publicity. They should have had a proper public involvement process and
proper environmental assessment, and they wouldn't be in this public relations
nightmare."

Wallis also criticized Amoco for promising in the agreement to pay Peigan legal
costs at the ERCB hearing, while rejecting a similar request by an environmental
coalition that includes the Alberta Wilderness Association.

Harvey Locke, lawyer for the the environmental coalition, said the agreement
"has absolutely no relevance to the ERCB's decision. Only evidence that is put
before the board with an opportunity for all participants to question is of any
value."

Bastien said the agreement gives some band members an opportunity to obtain
employment and education, and is an acknowledgment of the Peigan Nation's rights
in the area. Amoco has also agreed to "negotiate in good faith" with the chief
and council on further development if the exploratory well is successful.

The Peigans have never taken a stand for or against the well.

But Bastien said if the land ever became part of a land claims settlement, the
band would claim royalties that would normally be paid to the provincial
government.

The Peigan Nation is already involved in a legal wrangle with the provincial
government over who owns water in the Oldman River where it flows through the
reserve. If the case goes to court, it could result in a precedent-setting
decision on water rights.

Describing the Peigan as "one of the less rich" bands, Bastien said the
2,500-member Peigan Nation suffers 80 to 90 per cent unemployment. The majority
of Peigans live on a reserve at Brocket west of Pincher Creek.

Dave Newman, president of Amoco Canada, said he was extremely pleased to have a
working relationship with the Peigans, and noted that the company is committed
to understanding and respecting the band's interests in its traditional
territory.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.

energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.

Bill Text
The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

SECTION 1.
 (a) The University of California has committed to achieving carbon neutrality
through aggressive measures to increase energy efficiency and develop renewable
energy. The University of California's model should produce substantial
environmental and economic benefits, leverage current and planned investments by
the University of California and others, and include projects that are
immediately ready to commence.
(b) The California State University has similarly committed to lowering annual
energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering energy
-related operating costs. Over a five-year period, the California State
University expects to decrease demand by 5 percent and decrease electrical
consumption across the California State University system by 10 percent. The
California State University has committed to incorporate workforce development
strategies into its energy efficiency model.
(c) There are opportunities to reduce both the economic cost and carbon
footprints of campus facilities at the University of California and the
California State University by having more energy-efficient buildings,
operations, and maintenance. These financial savings could provide flexibility
to pay for other upgrades to enhance the learning environment and access to
higher education.
(d) It is in the best interest of the state to quickly reduce energy consumption
at university facilities, especially through building retrofits that achieve the
highest levels of energy efficiency improvement.
