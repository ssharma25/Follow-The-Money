FSA loans help youth start in farming

April 05--GLASGOW -- When Nick Jessie and Justin Tudor were in high school they
took advantage of the Farm Service Agency's Youth Loan Program.

They applied for loans to fund the purchase of beef cattle.

Jessie and Tudor were both members of the FFA organization at their school --
one of the requirements for obtaining a loan through FSA.

Tudor bought Gelbvieh registered cattle with his loan.

"I was AI [artificially inseminating] breeding them and keeping the bulls back
so I would have to buy bulls," he said. "I got probably five or six bulls out of
the registered cattle I bought."

He chose to buy Gelbvieh cattle because he wanted cattle that featured more
muscle, and because they are known for good maternal ability, he said.

Tudor chose to apply for an FSA Youth Loan because it is a low-interest loan.

"It's a good idea for a kid trying to start out," he said. "I was already
established. My dad took pretty good care of me. If you weren't already started
..., it would be a good way to go."

Tudor's dad raises beef cattle, as does Jessie's father.

Jessie chose to buy beef cattle with his FSA Youth Loan because he wanted to
enlarge his beef cattle herd.

Jessie works for Tudor's dad on his Summer Shade farm. Both he and Tudor have
chosen farming as a career. They grew up on a farm.

"I never thought about doing anything else," he said. "I just like being outside
all the time."

Farm Service Agency  Youth Loans are available for youth who range in age from
10 to 20 and who are involved in a program such as FFA or 4-H and are involved
in a supervised project through one of the organizations.

"Our FFA and 4-H organizations are very helpful in working with us in order to
be able to make these loans," said Helena Pitcock, farm loan officer for the
Barren-Metcalfe FSA office. "The youth, they have to have some type of adviser
and they have to be in one of those organizations, either 4-H, FFA or a similar
organization that relates to agriculture."

The maximum amount for farm youth loans is $5,000. Youth must have their
parents' permission and their project adviser must sign a document verifying
they are a member of FFA or 4-H.

"They are good little loans and they are helpful to kids who don't have any
other way to get started. Some of them will buy show heifers and show them in
the fairs. That gives them leadership abilities and also the experience of
intermingling with others and learning what's out there and what may be
available for them for college and so forth," Pitcock said.

Kentucky ranks in the top 10 in several areas, including youth loans, she said.

"We've been fortunate in Kentucky to be able to help a lot of youth," Pitcock
said.

Acquiring a Farm Service Agency Youth Loan gives youth a sampling of what it is
like to be a farmer, and will help them determine if they want to choose
agriculture as a career, she said.

"It also teaches them about keeping records, teaching them about what a
financial statement is, cash flow and it kind of helps them learn that money
doesn't come from parents or comes from trees," Pitcock said. "They learn how to
make their own money and to be successful and to budget."

Several youth who acquire loans through FSA return as adults to borrow money for
the purchase of livestock, equipment or even a farm, she said.

"We have several that have had youth loans with us that go into farming and
purchase a farm," Pitcock said.

There are not as many youth choosing farming as a career.

"The average age of the farmer right now I think is like 57 to 58 years old, and
we need more beginning farmers," she said. "We not only have the youth farm
loans, but we have other loan programs and we kind of target beginning farmers
to try to help them because of the low interest rate and they don't have to have
a down payment to purchase a farm. If the farm is appraised at $200,000, we
would loan them $200,000. They don't have to have a down payment to be able to
get it."

Pitcock said it helps if the borrower has some assets established, such as
livestock or farming equipment and that they don't have a lot of debt.

"If someone comes in wanting to borrow money for the whole thing, buy a farm,
buy their livestock, buy their equipment, everything, it's generally not going
to cash flow," she said. "They do have to have something already established
themselves, normally, for it to work; have some assets free of debt to get them
started."

Selangor to take legal action against 36 loan defaulters

BYLINE: By Annie Freeda Cruez

SECTION: National; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 488 words

DATELINE: Klang


KLANG, Wed. - The Selangor Government will take legal action in June
against 36 youths who have not repaid their loans.

They owe the Government more than RM400,000.

State Youth, Sports and Tourism Committee chairman Abdul Fatah Iskandar
said for a start, they would be taking six people to court for not
repaying the loan they took from the fund in 1990 to start businesses.

"The loan amounting to about RM180,000 was given with the assurance that
they would settle it within five years. Unfortunately, none of them
complied," he told reporters after attending a dialogue with State MCA and
Chinese association leaders at his office today.

He said action against the others would be instituted in stages.

"We have sent several warning notices to these people to remind them to
remit their repayment arrears or court action would be taken against them,
but none of them responded."

He said the State Government had to resort to this drastic action to
recover the money so as to allow others to apply for loans to start
businesses.

"It is unfair of these youths not to repay the loan they took because
others have been denied the facilities provided by the revolving fund to
expand their business activities," he added.

To date, he said loans amounting to more than RM500,000 had been given
to youths in the State under the Youth Entrepreneurship Programme, Small
Industry Programme and Youth in Agriculture Programme.

He said until June last year, only RM118,396 had been recovered from the
borrowers.

The Youth Trust Fund with an initial grant of RM1 million was set up
under the State Youth and Sports Department in 1989 to encourage youths to
participate in business and agriculture in big scale.

Under the three programmes, eligible youths in the State can borrow
between RM5,000 and RM50,000.

Abdul Fatah said majority of those who took the loan were now successful
entrepreneurs in various fields.

He urged those who had yet to repay their loans to do so as soon as
possible to avoid being taken to court.

Abdul Fatah said the State Government would also help the Youth and
Sports Ministry recover repayments from youths in the State who had taken
loans under the ministry's Youth Economic Development Trust Fund.

He said the State Government, through district youth offices, would
liaise with the ministry to identify youths in the States who had yet to
repay their loans.

To date, loans amounting to more than RM2 million have been given to
youths in the State from the fund administered by the ministry.

Earlier, at the dialogue session attended by leaders from Selangor MCA
Youth, Gerakan Belia Bersatu, Youth Malaysian Movement and Persatuan Siang
Lian, Abdul Fatah urged them to take part in the Rakan Muda programme
actively.

"It is sad that very few Chinese and Indian youths participate in the
Rakan Muda programme organised in Selangor," he added.

Pakistan: Youth revolution takes roots

LENGTH: 1085  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Dec. 17 -- Visualize the scenario when a very large section of 60 per
cent of Pakistani population i.e the youth, will become providers converting
from their status of dependents.

Quoting Maryam Nawaz, Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Programme, the
hundred-billion-rupee package announced by prime minister for youth's
empowerment and financial independence will convert the youth from dependents to
providers.

Once that dream comes true, Pakistan will definitely acquire the status of an
economic giant, free from the crutches of foreign aid. There can be no two
opinions about this turnaround that is bound to materialize in the foreseeable
future.

For sure, the youth revolution has taken roots courtesy the wise and timely
steps announced by PM Sharif. In fact, the PM has given serious thought to this
most important facet of national development. Being already blessed with one of
the biggest youth element that is not available to majority nations of the
world, Pakistan can get strengthened and grow, in leaps and bounds, provided
this most important element of national power (the youth) is given a proper
sense of direction, motivation and appropriate and timely facilitation. That has
now been done as evidenced from PM's Business Loan Scheme for Youth.

The prime minister is right in his contention that the government has opened new
vistas for the youth to become self-reliant. Previously, it was extremely
depressing to note the youth power going waste due to loss of direction and lack
of facilitation.

Those in other political parties who had been boasting of their youth power are
yet far away from formulating a working plan for youth whereas the PML-N
government has surpassed all other self-styled champions of the youth cause by
announcing the Youth Business Loan Scheme that is a total departure from such
schemes announced in the past. In the past, such schemes were either laden with
complicated procedures and formalities or had been in the grip of corruption
mafia that would disburse loans to their favourites or those paying illegal
gratification to the lending officials.

All those ugly things will not be tolerated anymore; the PM has not only
declared it unequivocally but also evolved a mechanism to plug the loopholes.
According to the PM, an effective monitoring mechanism has been put in place to
keep a check on the loan award process so that merit is ensured. In the first
phase, one hundred thousand unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot
and "no one, including me, would have the authority to influence the lending
process."

What is yet more encouraging and good news for more than half the country's
population i.e women folk, is that 50% of the loans have been allocated for the
female youth.

In the present scheme, most of the discrepancies identified in similar systems
functional in the past, have been removed and no harsh preconditions have been
attached to the youth business loan programme.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent.

The youth applying for loans will have to pay the mark-up of eight per cent
while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by the government since total
mark-up rate is 15%. Technical and business guidance will also be provided so
that the youth be guarded against possible failures of their businesses. For
this purpose 55 project pre-feasibilities have been prepared and are available
on SMEDA website, according to Maryam Nawaz. But the applicant can also
participate in the loan award process on the basis of his/her own business and
expertise.

The youth circles throughout the country especially their parents have hailed
the announcement made by the prime minister. They have also expressed their
gratitude to the prime minister for taking pains to personally supervise the
entire loan process for which a honourable figure like Maryam Nawaz has been
chosen. Maryam Nawaz, besides having a refined academic background is also known
for her leadership abilities that will definitely boost the morale of younger
generation.

The impression formed is that no official in the departments concerned will be
allowed to go for any bungling or malpractice in the youth loan scheme.

Maryam Nawaz has special interest in the youth empowerment project. She is on
record having stated, "The PM entrusted me with the responsibility of empowering
our youth and I gladly accepted because investment in youth is equal to
investment in Pakistan's development."

The same is Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's vision. The PM had pledged to himself to
ameliorate the younger generation's lot during his electioneering days.
According to the PM, "During the election campaign, I witnessed the vigour and
enthusiasm that the youth showed and I promised that the government should
empower the youth of Pakistan so that they can contribute effectively towards
development of the country."

It is a matter of delight for the entire nation that the PM's Youth Programme is
not only limited to easy loans (although this easy loan scheme is going to bring
about an economic revolution). Many other youth empowerment schemes are included
in the Programme like, for instance, Micro Interest-free loans programme, Skill
development programme, Fee reimbursement for deserving students programme and
Training programme. In all, they are six schemes that would tremendously
contribute towards the diversified capacity-building of Pakistani youth so as to
help them become builders of a strong, prosperous Pakistan. That destination is
now very much in sight, given the sagacious prioritization undertaken by the
Government of Pakistan under instructions from the prime minister.

Well-informed quarters have revealed that although input was taken from
different departments and officials, the PM's Youth Business Loan scheme is
purely the prime minister's brainchild as he was the one who first floated this
idea and then started working on it for final launching and implementation.

With this combination i.e vision and inspiration drawn from the prime minister,
the scheme is going to take off in full swing and yield the desired (positive)
results which mean economic benefits and confident, invigorated youth

New loan scheme for enterprising youths

BYLINE: By Annie Freeda Cruez

SECTION: National; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 526 words

DATELINE: Kuala Langat


KUALA LANGAT, Mon. - The Youth and Sports Ministry will introduce a new
loan scheme offering a maximum loan of RM50,000 to enterprising youths who
want to venture into the vendor and franchise business.

The money for the scheme, which will be started early next year, is
provided from the ministry's Youth Economic Development Group Trust Fund.

Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the ministry had
allocated RM100 million for the fund for the next five years.

He said the ministry's move to introduce the loan scheme was to
complement the Entrepreneur Development Ministry's efforts to create a
bigger pool of enterprising youths, especially among Bumiputeras.

"With Malaysia moving towards Vision 2020, there are many businesses
that youths can venture into and among them is the vendor and franchise
business," he told reporters after a briefing on the fund for about 300
youths at Dewan Jugra.

Muhyiddin said among the many franchise businesses that youths could
venture into were printing, furniture-making, fish ball packing, and
handicraft.

On the vendor scheme, he said youths could venture into small and
medium-scale industries and supporting industries producing component
parts for car manufacturing and electronic companies.

He said he had directed his officers to hold discussions with the
Entrepreneur Development Ministry to look into the various vendor and
franchise businesses that youths could venture into.

"Youths of all races, below 40 years of age, can apply for the loan but
priority will be given to those who venture into vendor, franchise and
specialised businesses which have a good market and will bring good
profits."

On the repayment of loans, Muhyiddin said out of 70 per cent of youths
who succeeded in their ventures after getting loans from the fund offered
by the ministry, only 40 per cent made regular repayments.

"The rest have not paid a single sen," he said, adding that of the RM27
million loans given from the fund since 1989, it had yet to recover RM14
million.

However, he said, the ministry had not instituted legal action against
those who had not repaid their loans as it was still investigating the
reason why they had not made any attempt to do so.

Between March and June this year, he said, the ministry gave out loans
totalling RM2 million from the fund to 100 youths to start their
businesses.

He said to enable more youths to be eligible for the loans, the ministry
had relaxed some of its rules and regulations, including increasing the
eligible age limit and extending the grace period for repayment of loans.

Selangor Tourism, Culture, Youth and Sports Committee chairman Datuk
Abdul Fatah Iskandar said the State Government supported the ministry's
move to get youths involved in business to help boost the national
economy.

Last year, he said, the ministry approved 162 projects for youths in
Selangor with loans totalling RM2.7 million. Of the amount, RM869,724 had
been repaid.

For this year, he said, the ministry approved six projects with loans
totalling RM120,000 while another 30 were awaiting approval.

PM launches youth business loan programme

BYLINE:  Sharafat Kazmi

SECTION: Vol. XXV No. 036

LENGTH: 892  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has said that the government has opened new
avenues for the youth to stand on firm footings. He said this while inaugurating
the Prime Minister's Business Loan Scheme for Youth here on Saturday.

He said that "during election campaign, I witnessed the vigor and enthusiasm
that the youth showed and I promised that the government should empower the
youth of Pakistan so that they can contribute effectively towards development of
the country". Prime Minister added that "I decided to accept the heavy
responsibility of forming government only for the youth and to solve their
problems as they are the future of Pakistan".

Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said that our government inherited huge problems including
weak economy, power shortage, terrorism and law & order situation, but we
accepted the challenge and immediately started working towards solutions.
Government started new power projects, retired circular debt, initiated targeted
operations against terrorists. However, time is required to see the results of
our efforts on ground.

While addressing the youth, Prime Minister said that there would be complete
transparency in the award of loans and an effective monitoring mechanism has
been evolved to keep a check on loan award process so that merit is ensured. He
further said that Rs. 100 billion has been allocated for this programme during
the current financial year and in the first phase one hundred thousand
unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot. "No one, even myself would
have the authority to influence the loan award process" said the Prime Minister.
Youth will have 8 years payback time with first year grace period for
re-payment.

Prime Minister said that Government reposes full trust on the youth of Pakistan
and expects that the loans would be utilized effectively to generate business
and employment opportunities. Fifty per cent of the loans are allocated for the
female youth. The Government is also announcing low-cost housing scheme for the
poor very soon.

The Prime Minister said loans would be extended to youth purely on merit through
ballot and there would be no discretionary quota of anyone including the Prime
Minister. He said over hundred branches of the banks concerned would make their
sovereign decision and also record reasons for acceptance or rejection of the
applications.

He said every month about fifteen thousand youth would be given loans and their
target is to grant loans to one hundred thousand youth during current financial
year.

He said apart from the trades identified by SMEDA, applicants can also launch
their own business in any other field or skill they possess.

The Prime Minister said he would soon announce a low cost housing scheme.

He said the country needs harmony and unity and the entire world has appreciated
the way smooth transition from one democracy to other took place after the
general elections.

Later, the Prime Minister responded to questions by the audience.

He told a questioner that illiterate persons are also entitled to apply provided
they have some skill or experience to run any business. He said loans would also
be extended for expansion of the existing businesses.

The Prime Minister said the government would encourage people to apply for loans
for different trades.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current year's budget are practically being implemented.

He said the Prime Minister abolished his discretionary fund and the Government
slashed expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other Ministries and
Divisions by thirty percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also
being slashed to save 3.5 billion rupees.

He pointed out that Pakistan's position improved by twelve points in corruption
index prepared by Transparency International.

The Finance Minister said the Prime Minister had announced six youth oriented
schemes and these would be launched one by one in coming days.

Ishaq Dar expressed the confidence that apart from National Bank and First Women
Bank, other banks would also join the scheme in the spirit of corporate social
responsibility.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Maryam Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of Mian Nawaz Sharif's
election commitments.

She said others only made pledges but the PML(N) government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.

Maryam Nawaz said there are only three conditions for the applicants- they
should be Pakistani, holder of valid Computerized National Identity Card and
should have a guarantor.

She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free of cost.

Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA offices to facilitate
applicants and guide them.

She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans.

The Chairperson said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the Loans. The Prime Minister himself would exercise vigilance
and different people would monitor the process in the garb of candidates.

She said loans would be extended on merit through ballot every month and
hopefully the first balloting would take place in January 2014.

Pakistan: Youth revolution takes root

LENGTH: 1086  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Dec. 17 -- Visualize the scenario when a very large section of 60 per
cent of Pakistani population i.e the youth, will become providers converting
from their status of dependents.

Quoting Maryam Nawaz, Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Programme, the
hundred-billion-rupee package announced by prime minister for youth's
empowerment and financial independence will convert the youth from dependents to
providers.

Once that dream comes true, Pakistan will definitely acquire the status of an
economic giant, free from the crutches of foreign aid. There can be no two
opinions about this turnaround that is bound to materialize in the foreseeable
future. For sure, the youth revolution has taken roots courtesy the wise and
timely steps announced by PM Sharif. In fact, the PM has given serious thought
to this most important facet of national development. Being already blessed with
one of the biggest youth element that is not available to majority nations of
the world, Pakistan can get strengthened and grow, in leaps and bounds, provided
this most important element of national power (the youth) is given a proper
sense of direction, motivation and appropriate and timely facilitation. That has
now been done as evidenced from PM's Business Loan Scheme for Youth.

The prime minister is right in his contention that the government has opened new
vistas for the youth to become self-reliant. Previously, it was extremely
depressing to note the youth power going waste due to loss of direction and lack
of facilitation. Those in other political parties who had been boasting of their
youth power are yet far away from formulating a working plan for youth whereas
the PML-N government has surpassed all other self-styled champions of the youth
cause by announcing the Youth Business Loan Scheme that is a total departure
from such schemes announced in the past. In the past, such schemes were either
laden with complicated procedures and formalities or had been in the grip of
corruption mafia that would disburse loans to their favourites or those paying
illegal gratification to the lending officials. All those ugly things will not
be tolerated anymore; the PM has not only declared it unequivocally but also
evolved a mechanism to plug the loopholes. According to the PM, an effective
monitoring mechanism has been put in place to keep a check on the loan award
process so that merit is ensured. In the first phase, one hundred thousand
unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot and "no one, including me,
would have the authority to influence the lending process." What is yet more
encouraging and good news for more than half the country's population i.e women
folk, is that 50% of the loans have been allocated for the female youth.

In the present scheme, most of the discrepancies identified in similar systems
functional in the past, have been removed and no harsh preconditions have been
attached to the youth business loan programme.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent. The youth applying for loans will have to pay
the mark-up of eight per cent while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by
the government since total mark-up rate is 15%. Technical and business guidance
will also be provided so that the youth be guarded against possible failures of
their businesses. For this purpose 55 project pre-feasibilities have been
prepared and are available on SMEDA website, according to Maryam Nawaz. But the
applicant can also participate in the loan award process on the basis of his/her
own business and expertise.

The youth circles throughout the country especially their parents have hailed
the announcement made by the prime minister. They have also expressed their
gratitude to the prime minister for taking pains to personally supervise the
entire loan process for which a honourable figure like Maryam Nawaz has been
chosen. Maryam Nawaz, besides having a refined academic background is also known
for her leadership abilities that will definitely boost the morale of younger
generation. The impression formed is that no official in the departments
concerned will be allowed to go for any bungling or malpractice in the youth
loan scheme. Maryam Nawaz has special interest in the youth empowerment project.
She is on record having stated, "The PM entrusted me with the responsibility of
empowering our youth and I gladly accepted because investment in youth is equal
to investment in Pakistan's development."

The same is Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's vision. The PM had pledged to himself to
ameliorate the younger generation's lot during his electioneering days.
According to the PM, "During the election campaign, I witnessed the vigour and
enthusiasm that the youth showed and I promised that the government should
empower the youth of Pakistan so that they can contribute effectively towards
development of the country."

It is a matter of delight for the entire nation that the PM's Youth Programme is
not only limited to easy loans (although this easy loan scheme is going to bring
about an economic revolution). Many other youth empowerment schemes are included
in the Programme like, for instance, Micro Interest-free loans programme, Skill

Web portal for PM Youth Schemes being developed to facilitate beneficiaries

SECTION: Vol. 39 No. 04

LENGTH: 451  words


Prime Minister's Youth Programme is in process of developing a web portal to
compile beneficiaries' data and facilitate applicants through provision of
comprehensive information and impact about its six schemes.

Chairperson, Prime Minister's Youth Programme, Ms Leila Khan on Sunday said it
would be the first of its kind portal providing single window for eligible youth
to access information and make  applications online.

In an exclusive talk with reporter here, she said, the portal would also help in
collecting overall data, adjudging impact of PM youth schemes and making future
strategies for improved and better results.

Ms Leila Khan said federal government was running six schemes under Prime
Minister's Youth Programme which included PM Youth Business Loans Scheme, PM
Interest Free Loan Scheme, PM Youth Skill Development Programme, PM Youth Laptop
Scheme, PM Fee Reimbursement Scheme and PM Youth Training Scheme.

She explained under PM Youth Business Loans Scheme more than 6,500 business
loans worth Rs. 6 billion have been disbursed among potential entrepreneurs aged
21-45 years across the country whereas under Prime Minister's Interest Free Loan
Scheme around 100,000 loans worth more than Rs. 2 billion have been granted to
poorest of the poor people in 44 under developed districts across Pakistan.

Leila Khan said the government was sincere in its efforts to fulfil its promise
which it made to the youth with regard to assist them financially and the
government had decided to involve the private banks in the PM youth loan scheme.

Replying to a question regarding disbursement of loans among beneficiaries,
Leila Khan said the government could not force or dictate bank management on
this matter.

The bank management has been given free hand for granting loan to the applicants
after verifying all requirements needed for the purpose, she commented.

She said the recovery percentage for PM Youth Business Loans Scheme is more than
94 and 100 for PM Interest Free Loan Scheme which shows success of these
schemes.

Ms. Leila Khan explained PM Youth Business Loan Scheme has been focused on
promoting SME sector which offers most viable option for private sector-led
growth that reduces poverty and creates a large number of jobs.

The beneficiaries of this scheme would become tax payers, their businesses will
create jobs, and they will be able to improve their living standards, the
Chairperson added.

Moreover, the Chairperson said out of the 100,000 Interest Free Loan
beneficiaries, around 25,000 are those who had a poverty score of less than
16.17 and were BISP beneficiaries. They had obtained PM Interest Free Loan in
order to become self-sustainable and start earning their livelihood.

Reverend defends Southtown Youth loan

BYLINE: Tesa Culli, Mt. Vernon Register-News, Ill.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 732 words


March 18--MT. VERNON -- The Revolving Loan Committee approved amending the pay
back terms of a 2003 loan made to Southtown Youth Programs, but not before being
blasted by the Rev. James Gordon.

"I know the city is not in the business of loaning money and not getting paid
back, but we help a lot of kids and that helps our community," Gordon said.
"...Without Southtown you wouldn't have a post office, the school wouldn't be
sending teachers to the area of the city. ... I've brought this city rave
reviews in Washington, D.C., I serve on statewide commissions. When the governor
is here, it's because of me. I was talking in Chicago last week about this city.
... It's well worth the investment being made."

Gordon began talking about the work of Southtown Youth Programs in the community
as the reason the committee should change the terms of the loan after members
began asking about the payment history of the loan. The $75,000 loan was made in
2003, the third Revolving Loan for Southtown Youth Programs, was extended in
2007 for an additional 17 months, and committee member Pete Bradham pointed out
payback of the loan was a problem from 2003 forward -- not the last few months
as Gordon originally presented.

"From the beginning, not just recently, payments have not been made," Bradham
said. "No one questions Southtown Youth is doing wonderful things."

City Manager and committee member Ron Neibert pointed out the Revolving Loan
started with money from the state with a charter to loan money that would create
jobs. The job creation for the Southtown Youth loan was five full time
equivalent jobs, which has not been met. Gordon said 10 people work with the
church, daycare and youth program.

"This committee is just trying to protect the assets of the loan," Neibert said.
"There have only been 33 of the 89 payments made over the life of the loan."

Committee member Eric Putney pointed out in 2008, only two of the $991 per month
payments were made on the loan -- in March and December. When the committee
asked Gordon for a personal guarantee on the loan, pointing out the Southtown
Youth Program Revolving Loan is the only one approved by the city without a
personal guarantee, Gordon said. "I will not personally guarantee this loan."

He was further asked if he would allow the city to receive direct payments from
the bank, as was done on a previous loan. Again, Gordon refused.

"I don't think the city should have to do that," Gordon said. "I know what I'm
doing for Mt. Vernon to make Mt. Vernon look good."

Gordon also criticized the board and media for being present.

"This is personal business, and shouldn't be in the newspaper," Gordon said. "I
don't want to see trash in there tomorrow."

Chairman Randy Forby told Gordon the committee, which loans taxpayer money, is a
public entity which is subject to the Open Meetings Act.

"I know how these papers operate," Gordon said, accusing the media of only being
at the meeting because Southtown Youth was on the agenda.

Gordon reversed his stance on direct payments, and a motion was made to
recommend the city council approve a modification to the Southtown Youth Program
loan to adjust the amortization schedule to equate to a monthly $500 payment on
the condition Southtown Youth sign an irrevocable payment authorization to the
city with the bank. Estimates indicated the new length of the loan will be an
additional nine years under the modification.

In other business, the committee:

--Approved a recommendation to approve a loan to LaVerne Butler in the amount of
$112,500 for the Rendezvous Grill and Bar to be located in the former Steppin'
Out Disco/Red Room building on South 10th Street. The loan would be for a 10
year term; and

--Modified the loan agreement of John Paul and Johnna Braswell to allow an extra
year for the job creation requirement on a loan; and

--Agreed to subordinate on two outstanding loans to the Braswell's to allow the
couple to refinance their bank loans at a new bank, which would place the city
in the same mortgage position as it is at this time.

own business and expertise.

LENGTH: 1048  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


Visualize the scenario when a very large section of 60 per cent of Pakistani
population i.e the youth, will become providers converting from their status of
dependents.

Quoting Maryam Nawaz, Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Programme, the
hundred-billion-rupee package announced by prime minister for youth's
empowerment and financial independence will convert the youth from dependents to
providers.



Once that dream comes true, Pakistan will definitely acquire the status of an
economic giant, free from the crutches of foreign aid. There can be no two
opinions about this turnaround that is bound to materialize in the foreseeable
future.

For sure, the youth revolution has taken roots courtesy the wise and timely
steps announced by PM Sharif. In fact, the PM has given serious thought to this
most important facet of national development. Being already blessed with one of
the biggest youth element that is not available to majority nations of the
world, Pakistan can get strengthened and grow, in leaps and bounds, provided
this most important element of national power (the youth) is given a proper
sense of direction, motivation and appropriate and timely facilitation. That has
now been done as evidenced from PM's Business Loan Scheme for Youth.

The prime minister is right in his contention that the government has opened new
vistas for the youth to become self-reliant. Previously, it was extremely
depressing to note the youth power going waste due to loss of direction and lack
of facilitation.

Those in other political parties who had been boasting of their youth power are
yet far away from formulating a working plan for youth whereas the PML-N
government has surpassed all other self-styled champions of the youth cause by
announcing the Youth Business Loan Scheme that is a total departure from such
schemes announced in the past. In the past, such schemes were either laden with
complicated procedures and formalities or had been in the grip of corruption
mafia that would disburse loans to their favourites or those paying illegal
gratification to the lending officials.

All those ugly things will not be tolerated anymore; the PM has not only
declared it unequivocally but also evolved a mechanism to plug the loopholes.
According to the PM, an effective monitoring mechanism has been put in place to
keep a check on the loan award process so that merit is ensured. In the first
phase, one hundred thousand unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot
and "no one, including me, would have the authority to influence the lending
process."

What is yet more encouraging and good news for more than half the country's
population i.e women folk, is that 50% of the loans have been allocated for the
female youth.

In the present scheme, most of the discrepancies identified in similar systems
functional in the past, have been removed and no harsh preconditions have been
attached to the youth business loan programme.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent.

The youth applying for loans will have to pay the mark-up of eight per cent
while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by the government since total
mark-up rate is 15%. Technical and business guidance will also be provided so
that the youth be guarded against possible failures of their businesses. For
this purpose 55 project pre-feasibilities have been prepared and are available
on SMEDA website, according to Maryam Nawaz. But the applicant can also
participate in the loan award process on the basis of his/her own business and
expertise.

The youth circles throughout the country especially their parents have hailed
the announcement made by the prime minister. They have also expressed their
gratitude to the prime minister for taking pains to personally supervise the
entire loan process for which a honourable figure like Maryam Nawaz has been
chosen. Maryam Nawaz, besides having a refined academic background is also known
for her leadership abilities that will definitely boost the morale of younger
generation.

The impression formed is that no official in the departments concerned will be
allowed to go for any bungling or malpractice in the youth loan scheme.

Maryam Nawaz has special interest in the youth empowerment project. She is on
record having stated, "The PM entrusted me with the responsibility of empowering
our youth and I gladly accepted because investment in youth is equal to
investment in Pakistan's development."

The same is Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's vision. The PM had pledged to himself to
ameliorate the younger generation's lot during his electioneering days.
According to the PM, "During the election campaign, I witnessed the vigour and
enthusiasm that the youth showed and I promised that the government should
empower the youth of Pakistan so that they can contribute effectively towards
development of the country."

It is a matter of delight for the entire nation that the PM's Youth Programme is
not only limited to easy loans (although this easy loan scheme is going to bring
about an economic revolution). Many other youth empowerment schemes are included
in the Programme like, for instance, Micro Interest-free loans programme, Skill
development programme, Fee reimbursement for deserving students programme and
Training programme. In all, they are six schemes that would tremendously
contribute towards the diversified capacity-building of Pakistani youth so as to
help them become builders of a strong, prosperous Pakistan. That destination is
now very much in sight, given the sagacious prioritization undertaken by the
Government of Pakistan under instructions from the prime minister.

Well-informed quarters have revealed that although input was taken from
different departments and officials, the PM's Youth Business Loan scheme is
purely the prime minister's brainchild as he was the one who first floated this
idea and then started working on it for final launching and implementation.

With this combination i.e vision and inspiration drawn from the prime minister,
the scheme is going to take off in full swing and yield the desired (positive)
results which mean economic benefits and confident, invigorated youth.

Youth loan scheme to help alleviate poverty: Nawaz

SECTION: Vol. XXXVIII No. 05

LENGTH: 465  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday the youth loan programme
would help alleviate poverty in the country.

Addressing the launching ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth Loan Programme
organized by National Bank of Pakistan (NBP)  here at Okara Sports Complex, he
said loans would help people send their children to school and become useful
members of society.

The Prime Minister said Rs 100 billion allocation for the loan scheme reflected
his trust in youth, who would put the country on the road to progress.

He said youth had immense potential and could play a positive role in the
country's progress. The youth remained deprived of their right to progress
during last 65 years and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government decided to
bring them into the mainstream by providing financial facilities through the
banking sector.

Even developed countries like Japan, Germany and Britain had provided financial
assistance to the youth to enable them set up their own businesses, he added.

"Only those countries made progress that followed the constitution in letter and
spirit. I believe the 60 percent youth population will not let us down and make
the country proud," he added.

He said he wanted to launch the youth loan scheme in 1999, but was stopped by
former dictator General Pervez Musharraf from serving the youth.

He said the loan scheme was for the whole country, including Federally
Administered Tribal Areas, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab.

The Prime Minister said he had started the loan scheme from Hyderabad and was
pleased to fulfil his promise made during the election campaign.

He said some people were opposing the loan scheme for their vested interests.
They were not ready to trust the youth.  In fact, such elements were themselves
not worthy enough to be trusted.

Nawaz Sharif said the government had decided to relax some conditions for
getting loan. Now a blood relation could become a guarantor for a loan seeker.
Government officers of Grade 15 and above were also allowed to sign a loan
guarantee.

Nawaz Sharif said half a million youth would benefit from the loan scheme in the
first phase while the facility would be extended to some 5 million in later
stages.

He said he would himself visit all divisional headquarters to monitor
transparency in the loan process.

The Prime Minister, later, mingled with the youth and asked them about the
problems in availing the loan facility. He assured them that there would be no
compromise on merit.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Board of Directors of NBP Munir Kamal said
progress in the country was not possible without uplifting small businessmen.

The Prime Minister directed SMEDA and National Bank authorities to address
problems of loan applicants.

Culture of nepotism must end: Nawaz; Country can progress tremendously by
harnessing youth talent

BYLINE:  Our Correspondent

SECTION: Vol. XXV No. 063

LENGTH: 1255  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Friday, "we need to rid Pakistan of the
culture of nepotism," adding that "sifarish is like a cancer that needs to be
treated".

Speaking here about the Youth Loan Business Scheme, the premier claimed the
process of loan approval was free of nepotism. He added that "even my own
recommendations will not influence the selection process of this scheme,"
garnering applause from the audience.

Some children are not able to get an education because of a lack of resources,
Nawaz said, adding that "the biggest obligation to facilitate [these children]
lies with the government, but society should help as well."

Addressing the scheme's applicants, Nawaz said "I want your future to be given
back to you." He said he wanted to speak to the applicants and learn more about
them and what they plan to do with the loans. Justifying the new loan scheme,
Nawaz said banks offer loans to "baray log" but the poor and needy are not given
such options.

Nawaz said those selected for this scheme will be expected to return the loan in
eight years. The first year will be a grace period in which they will not need
to return anything, he stated.

The scheme will not only benefit those who receive it, it will also increase
available jobs and perhaps increase exports from Pakistan, the premier added. "I
hope to see the positive impact of this scheme in a year's time," Nawaz said.

He said the loan scheme would help boost the country's GDP (gross development
product) and support the families of borrowers as well as of those allied with
their businesses.

The Prime Minister deplored that disadvantaged segments of the society have
remained ignored ever since independence and said it is duty of the government
to give everyone his right. He said decisions should be made on merit and
without consideration of casteâ(EURO)s creedâ(EURO)s parochialism or faith.

Nawaz lauded people of Sindh for receiving migrants at the time of independence
with open arms. He said all parts of the country demonstrated spirit of
sacrifice but this was of unique nature in Sindh.

The prime minister further said banks too have no discretion and they will have
to pen down reasons while accepting or rejecting applications for loans. He said
positive results of Business Loans will start coming out after one year. He said
economic activities generated through these loans will help increase GDP growth
and exports of the country.

The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the youth will come up to his
expectations and the expectations of the nation. He also hoped that the youth
will work hard in the businesses and return the loans in a good manner. Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said the country could achieve tremendous development by
harnessing the youth's talent and energy, who formed 60 percent of the
population.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of Youth Business Scheme here at Hyderabad
Club, he said the government had decided to empower the youth economically by
granting loans to help them launch their own businesses. This would not only
help improve the socio-economic condition of the youth, but also directly
benefit their family members, and other stakeholders engaged in different
busniess activities, he added.

A total of 40 applicants, including 18 women, whose loan applications fulfilling
codal formalities were accepted also attended the function and replied to the
queries of Prime Minister. Nawaz Sharif said the government had launched the
scheme to improve the economic condition of the youth, who would be given loans
ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 2 million.

The government realised that the country's educated and uneducated youth had no
access to financial opportunities for their economic empowerment. No development
could be achieved without active participation of the youth, he said and added
the government had decided to make the future builders financially strong.

He said youth were the major contributors to the development of any country and
the government was determined to open vistas for them, who remained neglected so
far. In the past, big loans, amounting upto Rs 20 billion were being granted to
individuals or groups, but the youth were ignored, he said.

The Prime Minister said the present government was determined to remove the
sense of deprivation among the youth by supporting them. Nawaz Sharif said a
transparent policy had been formed for granting loans to the deserving youth
purely on merit and no pressure would be tolerated.

Even he himself could not assert pressure on the authorities concerned in giving
loans, he said and added only those would avail the facility who had
comprehensive plans to start their business. The Prime Minister said the scheme
was actually conceived during his last tenure, but it could not be launched due
to unavoidable circumstances.

He said he had never forgotten the scheme and committed to the youth during his
recent election campaign. Now, the youth would soon reap its benefits. The
scheme would bring a great change in the socio- economic conditions of the
people in about a year. It would not only gear up economic activities, but also
help improve the gross domestic product, he added.

He criticised those who were trying to mislead the youth by making propaganda
against the scheme. He called upon the youth not to pay any heed to them and
work for the country's progress and prosperity by availing the opportunity.
Recalling the Yellow Cab Scheme launched during his second tenure, the Prime
Minister said it proved very successful as 99 percent recovery rate had been
achieved.

He expressed the hope that after getting loan, the youth would work hard to
promote their businesses and return their liabilities within scheduled time. The
Prime Minister said the youth through their hard work would help government
launch development projects in every nook and corner of the country.

He said the government had decided to launch Karachi Circular Railways and he
had already chaired a meeting in this regard. He said the government was
determined to serve the masses without discrimination and was making decisions
purely on merit. The time was not far when the people would enjoy the fruit of
his efforts.

He said Sindh had played a great role after the creation of Pakistan as it
welcomed all those wholeheartedly, who came here after migration from other
parts of the Sub-continent. The Prime Minister said under Youth Business Scheme,
the youth would have to repay the loan within eight years and no recovery would
be made during the first year.

Realizing the difficulties of the youth in getting guarantors, he said the
government had made some relaxation in that respect. The applicants could now
name their relatives as guarantors. They could also furnish the guarantee of
government officers of Grade-15 or above. The applicants could also produce the
guarantee of more than one person and even they could get loan against moveable
and immoveable property worth 1.5 (one point five) times more than the required
amount, he said.

He said the condition of having bank account with National Bank of Pakistan had
also been relaxed and now those having accounts with other banks could also
apply. He said that under directives of the Prime Minister and Chairperson of
the Prime Minister's Youth Development Programme, Maryam Nawaz, a transparent
policy had been framed for granting loan.

Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held direct interaction with the applicants,
who were selected for grant of loan after completion of required formalities.

Culture of nepotism must end: Nawaz; Country can progress tremendously by
harnessing youth talent

BYLINE:  Our Correspondent

SECTION: Vol. XXV No. 063

LENGTH: 1255  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Friday, "we need to rid Pakistan of the
culture of nepotism," adding that "sifarish is like a cancer that needs to be
treated".

Speaking here about the Youth Loan Business Scheme, the premier claimed the
process of loan approval was free of nepotism. He added that "even my own
recommendations will not influence the selection process of this scheme,"
garnering applause from the audience.

Some children are not able to get an education because of a lack of resources,
Nawaz said, adding that "the biggest obligation to facilitate [these children]
lies with the government, but society should help as well."

Addressing the scheme's applicants, Nawaz said "I want your future to be given
back to you." He said he wanted to speak to the applicants and learn more about
them and what they plan to do with the loans. Justifying the new loan scheme,
Nawaz said banks offer loans to "baray log" but the poor and needy are not given
such options.

Nawaz said those selected for this scheme will be expected to return the loan in
eight years. The first year will be a grace period in which they will not need
to return anything, he stated.

The scheme will not only benefit those who receive it, it will also increase
available jobs and perhaps increase exports from Pakistan, the premier added. "I
hope to see the positive impact of this scheme in a year's time," Nawaz said.

He said the loan scheme would help boost the country's GDP (gross development
product) and support the families of borrowers as well as of those allied with
their businesses.

The Prime Minister deplored that disadvantaged segments of the society have
remained ignored ever since independence and said it is duty of the government
to give everyone his right. He said decisions should be made on merit and
without consideration of casteâ(EURO)s creedâ(EURO)s parochialism or faith.

Nawaz lauded people of Sindh for receiving migrants at the time of independence
with open arms. He said all parts of the country demonstrated spirit of
sacrifice but this was of unique nature in Sindh.

The prime minister further said banks too have no discretion and they will have
to pen down reasons while accepting or rejecting applications for loans. He said
positive results of Business Loans will start coming out after one year. He said
economic activities generated through these loans will help increase GDP growth
and exports of the country.

The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the youth will come up to his
expectations and the expectations of the nation. He also hoped that the youth
will work hard in the businesses and return the loans in a good manner. Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said the country could achieve tremendous development by
harnessing the youth's talent and energy, who formed 60 percent of the
population.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of Youth Business Scheme here at Hyderabad
Club, he said the government had decided to empower the youth economically by
granting loans to help them launch their own businesses. This would not only
help improve the socio-economic condition of the youth, but also directly
benefit their family members, and other stakeholders engaged in different
busniess activities, he added.

A total of 40 applicants, including 18 women, whose loan applications fulfilling
codal formalities were accepted also attended the function and replied to the
queries of Prime Minister. Nawaz Sharif said the government had launched the
scheme to improve the economic condition of the youth, who would be given loans
ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 2 million.

The government realised that the country's educated and uneducated youth had no
access to financial opportunities for their economic empowerment. No development
could be achieved without active participation of the youth, he said and added
the government had decided to make the future builders financially strong.

He said youth were the major contributors to the development of any country and
the government was determined to open vistas for them, who remained neglected so
far. In the past, big loans, amounting upto Rs 20 billion were being granted to
individuals or groups, but the youth were ignored, he said.

The Prime Minister said the present government was determined to remove the
sense of deprivation among the youth by supporting them. Nawaz Sharif said a
transparent policy had been formed for granting loans to the deserving youth
purely on merit and no pressure would be tolerated.

Even he himself could not assert pressure on the authorities concerned in giving
loans, he said and added only those would avail the facility who had
comprehensive plans to start their business. The Prime Minister said the scheme
was actually conceived during his last tenure, but it could not be launched due
to unavoidable circumstances.

He said he had never forgotten the scheme and committed to the youth during his
recent election campaign. Now, the youth would soon reap its benefits. The
scheme would bring a great change in the socio- economic conditions of the
people in about a year. It would not only gear up economic activities, but also
help improve the gross domestic product, he added.

He criticised those who were trying to mislead the youth by making propaganda
against the scheme. He called upon the youth not to pay any heed to them and
work for the country's progress and prosperity by availing the opportunity.
Recalling the Yellow Cab Scheme launched during his second tenure, the Prime
Minister said it proved very successful as 99 percent recovery rate had been
achieved.

He expressed the hope that after getting loan, the youth would work hard to
promote their businesses and return their liabilities within scheduled time. The
Prime Minister said the youth through their hard work would help government
launch development projects in every nook and corner of the country.

He said the government had decided to launch Karachi Circular Railways and he
had already chaired a meeting in this regard. He said the government was
determined to serve the masses without discrimination and was making decisions
purely on merit. The time was not far when the people would enjoy the fruit of
his efforts.

He said Sindh had played a great role after the creation of Pakistan as it
welcomed all those wholeheartedly, who came here after migration from other
parts of the Sub-continent. The Prime Minister said under Youth Business Scheme,
the youth would have to repay the loan within eight years and no recovery would
be made during the first year.

Realizing the difficulties of the youth in getting guarantors, he said the

PM inaugurates Youth Business Loan Scheme

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 776

LENGTH: 736  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has said that the government has opened new
avenues for the youth to stand on firm footings. He said this while inaugurating
the Prime Minister's Business Loan Scheme for Youth here in Islamabad today
(Saturday).

He said that "during election campaign, I witnessed the vigor and enthusiasm
that the youth showed and I promised that the government should empower the
youth of Pakistan so that they can contribute effectively towards development of
the country". Prime Minister added that "I decided to accept the heavy
responsibility of forming government only for the youth and to solve their
problems as they are the future of Pakistan".

Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said that our government inherited huge problems including
weak economy, power shortage, terrorism and law & order situation, but we
accepted the challenge and immediately started working towards solutions.
Government started new power projects, retired circular debt, initiated targeted
operations against terrorists. However, time is required to see the results of
our efforts on ground.

While addressing the youth, Prime Minister said that there would be complete
transparency in the award of loans and an effective monitoring mechanism has
been evolved to keep a check on loan award process so that merit is ensured. He
further said that Rs. 100 billion has been allocated for this program during the
current financial year and in the first phase one hundred thousand unemployed
youth would be given loans through ballot. "No one, even myself would have the
authority to influence the loan award process" said the Prime Minister. Youth
will have 8 years payback time with first year grace period for re-payment.

Prime Minister said that Government reposes full trust on the youth of Pakistan
and expects that the loans would be utilized effectively to generate business
and employment opportunities. 50 % of the loans are allocated for the female
youth. The Government is also announcing low-cost housing scheme for the poor
very soon.

Earlier, the Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Program Ms. Maryam Nawaz said
that the most important advantage of the PM Youth Program is that the youth
would be converted from "dependents" to "providers". She said that the PM
entrusted me with the responsibility of empowering our youth and I gladly
accepted because investing in youth is equal to investing in Pakistan's
development. The PM Youth Program comprises of 6 schemes including Business
Loans Program, Micro Interest Free Loans Program, Skill Development program, Fee
Reimbursement for deserving students Program and Training Program.

Ms. Maryam Nawaz further informed that 55 project pre-feasibilities have been
prepared and are available on SMEDA website. However, if the applicant has
his/her own business plan, that too would be acceptable for participation in the
award process. The National Bank of Pakistan and the First Women's Bank have
been strictly directed to ensure complete transparency and merit.

Pakistan, Iraq to boost bilateral trade, says Nawaz: Prime Minister Muhammad
Nawaz Sharif has said that Pakistan and Iraq should fully exploit tremendous
potential for promoting bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

Talking to the Speaker of Iraqi Assembly Osama Abdul Aziz Al-Nujaifi in
Islamabad on Saturday, he said a stable and united Iraq is in the interest of
the region as well as international peace and security.

Nawaz Sharif says a stable Iraq is in interest of the region as well as
international peace and security. Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif says
Pakistan and Iraq should fully exploit tremendous potential for promoting
bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

The Iraqi Speaker hoped that parliamentary relations between the two countries
would further strengthen. Meanwhile, the Iraqi delegation of women
parliamentarians met with the members of Women's Parliamentary Caucus in
Islamabad.

The delegation was given a comprehensive presentation on conception,
achievements and contribution of the Caucus in safeguarding women rights in
Pakistan.

The meeting concluded with a joint agreement to work collaboratively on
addressing the common issues faced by women of both countries. It was proposed
that a bilateral forum of women parliamentarians from Pakistan and Iraq should
be established which will also facilitate the Iraqi women parliamentarians in
forming a body similar to WPC.

Pakistan: Youth loan scheme to help alleviate poverty: Nawaz

LENGTH: 494  words

DATELINE: OKARA


OKARA, Jan. 5 -- Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif

said on Saturday the youth loan programme would help alleviate

poverty in the country.

Addressing the launching ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth

Loan Programme, organized by National Bank of Pakistan (NBP)

here at Okara Sports Complex, he said loans would help people

send their children to school and become useful members of

society.

The Prime Minister said Rs 100 billion allocation for the

loan scheme reflected his trust in youth, who would put the

country on the road to progress.

He said youth had immense potential and could play a

positive role in the country's progress. The youth remained

deprived of their right to progress during last 65 years and

the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government decided to bring

them into the mainstream by providing financial facilities

through the banking sector.

Even developed countries like Japan, Germany and Britain

had provided financial assistance to the youth to enable them

set up their own businesses, he added.

"Only those countries made progress that followed the

constitution in letter and spirit. I believe the 60 percent youth

population will not let us down and make the country proud," he

added.

He said he wanted to launch the youth loan scheme in 1999,

but was stopped by former dictator General Pervez Musharraf

from serving the youth.

He said the loan scheme was for the whole country,

including Federally Administred Tribal Areas, Gilgit-Baltistan,

Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan

and Punjab.

The Prime Minister said he had started the loan

scheme from Hyderabad and was pleased to fulfil his promise

made during the election campaign.

He said some people were opposing the loan scheme for

their vested interests. They were not ready to trust the youth.

In fact, such elements were themselves not worthy enough to

be trusted.

Nawaz Sharif said the government had decided to relax some

conditions for getting loan. Now a blood relation could become

a guarantor for a loan seeker. Government officers of Grade 15

and above were also allowed to sign a loan guarantee.

Nawaz Sharif said half a million youth would benefit from the loan

scheme in the first phase while the facility would be extended to

some 5 million in later stages.

He said he would himself visit all divisional headquarters to

monitor transperancy in the loan process.

The Prime Minister, later, mingled with the youth and asked

them about the problems in availing the loan facility. He assured

them that there would be no compromise on merit.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Board of Directors of NBP

Munir Kamal said progress in the country was not possible without

uplifting small businessmen.

The Prime Minister directed SMEDA and National Bank

authorities to address problems of loan applicants

Entrepreneur loan scheme: youth revolution takes roots

BYLINE:  S Rahman

SECTION: Vol. IV No. 157

LENGTH: 613  words


Visualise the scenario when a very large section of 60 per cent of Pakistani
population - youth - will become providers converting from their status of
dependents.

Quoting Maryam Nawaz, Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Programme, the
hundred-billion-rupee package announced by prime minister for youth's
empowerment and financial independence will convert the youth from dependents to
providers.

Once that dream comes true, Pakistan will definitely acquire the status of an
economic giant, free from the crutches of foreign aid.

There can be no two opinions about this turnaround that is bound to materialize
in the foreseeable future. For sure, the youth revolution has taken roots
courtesy the wise and timely steps announced by PM Sharif. In fact, the PM has
given serious thought to this most important facet of national development.
Being already blessed with one of the biggest youth element that is not
available to majority nations of the world, Pakistan can get strengthened and
grow, in leaps and bounds, provided this most important element of national
power (the youth) is given a proper sense of direction, motivation and
appropriate and timely facilitation. That has now been done as evidenced from
PM's Business Loan Scheme for Youth.

The Prime Minister is right in his contention that the government has opened new
vistas for the youth to become self-reliant. Previously, it was extremely
depressing to note the youth power going waste due to loss of direction and lack
of facilitation. Those in other political parties who had been boasting of their
youth power are yet far away from formulating a working plan for youth whereas
the PML-N government has surpassed all other self-styled champions of the youth
cause by announcing the Youth Business Loan Scheme that is a total departure
from such schemes announced in the past. In the past, such schemes were either
laden with complicated procedures and formalities or had been in the grip of
corruption mafia that would disburse loans to their favourites or those paying
illegal gratification to the lending officials.

All those ugly things will not be tolerated anymore; the PM has not only
declared it unequivocally but also evolved a mechanism to plug the loopholes.
According to the PM, an effective monitoring mechanism has been put in place to
keep a check on the loan award process so that merit is ensured. In the first
phase, one hundred thousand unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot
and "no one, including me, would have the authority to influence the lending
process".

What is yet more encouraging and good news for more than half of the country's
population - women folk - is that 50 per cent of the loans allocated for the
female youth.

In the present scheme, most of the discrepancies identified in similar systems
functional in the past, have been removed and no harsh preconditions have been
attached to the youth business loan programme.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent. The youth applying for loans will have to pay
the mark-up of eight per cent while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by
the government since total mark-up rate is 15 per cent. Technical and business
guidance will also be provided so that the youth be guarded against possible
failures of their businesses. For this purpose, 55 project pre-feasibilities
have been prepared and are available on SMEDA website, according to Maryam
Nawaz. But the applicant can also participate in the loan award process on the
basis of his/her own business and expertise.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent. The youth applying for loans will have to pay
the mark-up of eight per cent while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by
the government since total mark-up rate is 15 per cent. Technical and business
guidance will also be provided so that the youth be guarded against possible
failures of their businesses. For this purpose, 55 project pre-feasibilities
have been prepared and are available on SMEDA website, according to Maryam
Nawaz. But the applicant can also participate in the loan award process on the
basis of his/her own business and expertise.

Pakistan PM says youth loan scheme to help alleviate poverty

LENGTH: 491 words


Text of report by Pakistani news agency APP

Okara, 4 Jan: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday [4 Jan] the
youth loan programme would help alleviate poverty in the country.

Addressing the launching ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth Loan Programme,
organized by National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) here at Okara Sports Complex, he
said loans would help people send their children to school and become useful
members of society.

The Prime Minister said Rs 100 billion allocation for the loan scheme reflected
his trust in youth, who would put the country on the road to progress.

He said youth had immense potential and could play a positive role in the
country's progress. The youth remained deprived of their right to progress
during last 65 years and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government decided to
bring them into the mainstream by providing financial facilities through the
banking sector. Even developed countries like Japan, Germany and Britain had
provided financial assistance to the youth to enable them set up their own
businesses, he added.

"Only those countries made progress that followed the constitution in letter and
spirit. I believe the 60 percent youth population will not let us down and make
the country proud," he added.

He said he wanted to launch the youth loan scheme in 1999, but was stopped by
former dictator General Pervez Musharraf from serving the youth.

He said the loan scheme was for the whole country, including Federally
Administred Tribal Areas, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab.

The Prime Minister said he had started the loan scheme from Hyderabad and was
pleased to fulfil his promise made during the election campaign.

He said some people were opposing the loan scheme for their vested interests.
They were not ready to trust the youth. In fact, such elements were themselves
not worthy enough to be trusted.

Nawaz Sharif said the government had decided to relax some conditions for
getting loan. Now a blood relation could become a guarantor for a loan seeker.
Government officers of Grade 15 and above were also allowed to sign a loan
guarantee. Nawaz Sharif said half a million youth would benefit from the loan
scheme in the first phase while the facility would be extended to some 5 million
in later stages.

He said he would himself visit all divisional headquarters to monitor
transperancy in the loan process.

The Prime Minister, later, mingled with the youth and asked them about the
problems in availing the loan facility. He assured them that there would be no
compromise on merit.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Board of Directors of NBP Munir Kamal said
progress in the country was not possible without uplifting small businessmen.
The Prime Minister directed SMEDA and National Bank authorities to address
problems of loan applicants.

Entrepreneur loan scheme: youth revolution takes roots

LENGTH: 613  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


Visualise the scenario when a very large section of 60 per cent of Pakistani
population - youth - will become providers converting from their status of
dependents.

Quoting Maryam Nawaz, Honorary Chairperson of the PM Youth Programme, the
hundred-billion-rupee package announced by prime minister for youth's
empowerment and financial independence will convert the youth from dependents to
providers.

Once that dream comes true, Pakistan will definitely acquire the status of an
economic giant, free from the crutches of foreign aid.

There can be no two opinions about this turnaround that is bound to materialize
in the foreseeable future. For sure, the youth revolution has taken roots
courtesy the wise and timely steps announced by PM Sharif. In fact, the PM has
given serious thought to this most important facet of national development.
Being already blessed with one of the biggest youth element that is not
available to majority nations of the world, Pakistan can get strengthened and
grow, in leaps and bounds, provided this most important element of national
power (the youth) is given a proper sense of direction, motivation and
appropriate and timely facilitation. That has now been done as evidenced from
PM's Business Loan Scheme for Youth.

The Prime Minister is right in his contention that the government has opened new
vistas for the youth to become self-reliant. Previously, it was extremely
depressing to note the youth power going waste due to loss of direction and lack
of facilitation. Those in other political parties who had been boasting of their
youth power are yet far away from formulating a working plan for youth whereas
the PML-N government has surpassed all other self-styled champions of the youth
cause by announcing the Youth Business Loan Scheme that is a total departure
from such schemes announced in the past. In the past, such schemes were either
laden with complicated procedures and formalities or had been in the grip of
corruption mafia that would disburse loans to their favourites or those paying
illegal gratification to the lending officials.

All those ugly things will not be tolerated anymore; the PM has not only
declared it unequivocally but also evolved a mechanism to plug the loopholes.
According to the PM, an effective monitoring mechanism has been put in place to
keep a check on the loan award process so that merit is ensured. In the first
phase, one hundred thousand unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot
and "no one, including me, would have the authority to influence the lending
process".

What is yet more encouraging and good news for more than half of the country's
population - women folk - is that 50 per cent of the loans allocated for the
female youth.

In the present scheme, most of the discrepancies identified in similar systems
functional in the past, have been removed and no harsh preconditions have been
attached to the youth business loan programme.

Even the repayment plan is quite easy as the loan-securing youth will be given
eight-year payback time with first year grace period for repayment at low
mark-up rate of eight per cent. The youth applying for loans will have to pay
the mark-up of eight per cent while the remaining seven per cent will be paid by
the government since total mark-up rate is 15 per cent. Technical and business
guidance will also be provided so that the youth be guarded against possible
failures of their businesses. For this purpose, 55 project pre-feasibilities
have been prepared and are available on SMEDA website, according to Maryam

Around 6,500 loans worth Rs. 5.8 bln disbursed under PM Youth Business Loans
Scheme: Chairperson

SECTION: Vol. 14 No. 346

LENGTH: 491  words


Around 6,500 business loans worth Rs. 5.8 billion have so far been disbursed
among potential entrepreneurs across the country under Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loans Scheme.

Chairperson, Prime Minister's Youth Programme, Ms Leila Khan informed a
delegation of World Bank which met with her here on Thursday.

The delegation, comprising Ms Theresa Paulelle Jones and Amjad Zafar Khan, was
apprised of various interventions of Federal Government under Prime Minister's
Youth Programme for socio-economic development of people, especially the youth.

She said under Prime Minister's Interest Free Loan Scheme around 100,000
interest free loans worth more than Rs. 2 billion have been granted to poorest
of the poor people in 44 under developed districts across Pakistan.

The Chairperson said out of the 100,000 Interest Free Loan beneficiaries, around
25,000 are those who had a poverty score of less than 16.17 and were BISP
beneficiaries.  These had graduated from BISP programme and had obtained PM
Interest Free Loan in order to become self-sustainable and start earning their
livelihood.

She said Federal Government is running six schemes under Prime Minister's Youth
Programme which include Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans Scheme, Prime
Minister's Interest Free Loan Scheme, Prime Minister's Youth Skill Development
Programme, Prime Minister's Youth Laptop Scheme, Prime Minister's Fee
Reimbursement Scheme, and Prime Minister's Youth Training Scheme.

Ms Leila Khan expressed her desire to engage international development partners
like World Bank, Asian Development Bank, USAID, IDB, Saudi Development Fund and
DFID for enhancing scope and impact of these schemes, which are already being
run successfully.

She said PM Youth Skill Development Programme has trained 25000 youth in more
than 100 demand-driven trades in Phase-I, and is currently training another
25,000 trainees under Phase-II of the Programme.

The Chairperson highlighted that skilled training is provided so that people can
use these skills and start a small level enterprise after securing loan under PM
Interest Free Loan scheme.

The Chairperson said PM Youth Laptop and PM Fee Reimbursement schemes are
focusing on promotion of higher education among youth and added under Laptop
Scheme, the government has so far distributed around 100,000 laptops to
MS/MPhil, PhD, Masters and Bachelors students enrolled in HEC-recognized public
sector universities/colleges across Pakistan.

Similarly, she said under PM Fee Reimbursement Scheme, fee of almost 100,000
students, hailing from less developed areas has been paid/reimbursed.

Above all, PM Youth Training Scheme, about to be launched very soon, will offer
150,000 ( Rs 50,000 per year for a period of three years 2015-18) paid
internships @ Rs. 12,000 per intern per month to fresh university graduates aged
up to 25 in reputed public and private sector organizations across Pakistan to
enhance their employability in the market.

Culture of nepotism must end: Nawaz

LENGTH: 1253  words

DATELINE: Hyderabad


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Friday, "we need to rid Pakistan of the
culture of nepotism," adding that "sifarish is like a cancer that needs to be
treated".

Speaking here about the Youth Loan Business Scheme, the premier claimed the
process of loan approval was free of nepotism. He added that "even my own
recommendations will not influence the selection process of this scheme,"
garnering applause from the audience.

Some children are not able to get an education because of a lack of resources,
Nawaz said, adding that "the biggest obligation to facilitate [these children]
lies with the government, but society should help as well."

Addressing the scheme's applicants, Nawaz said "I want your future to be given
back to you." He said he wanted to speak to the applicants and learn more about
them and what they plan to do with the loans. Justifying the new loan scheme,
Nawaz said banks offer loans to "baray log" but the poor and needy are not given
such options.

Nawaz said those selected for this scheme will be expected to return the loan in
eight years. The first year will be a grace period in which they will not need
to return anything, he stated.

The scheme will not only benefit those who receive it, it will also increase
available jobs and perhaps increase exports from Pakistan, the premier added. "I
hope to see the positive impact of this scheme in a year's time," Nawaz said.

He said the loan scheme would help boost the country's GDP (gross development
product) and support the families of borrowers as well as of those allied with
their businesses.

The Prime Minister deplored that disadvantaged segments of the society have
remained ignored ever since independence and said it is duty of the government
to give everyone his right. He said decisions should be made on merit and
without consideration of caste[#x201a] creed[#x201a] parochialism or faith.

Nawaz lauded people of Sindh for receiving migrants at the time of independence
with open arms. He said all parts of the country demonstrated spirit of
sacrifice but this was of unique nature in Sindh.

The prime minister further said banks too have no discretion and they will have
to pen down reasons while accepting or rejecting applications for loans. He said
positive results of Business Loans will start coming out after one year. He said
economic activities generated through these loans will help increase GDP growth
and exports of the country.

The Prime Minister expressed the hope that the youth will come up to his
expectations and the expectations of the nation. He also hoped that the youth
will work hard in the businesses and return the loans in a good manner. Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said the country could achieve tremendous development by
harnessing the youth's talent and energy, who formed 60 percent of the
population.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of Youth Business Scheme here at Hyderabad
Club, he said the government had decided to empower the youth economically by
granting loans to help them launch their own businesses. This would not only
help improve the socio-economic condition of the youth, but also directly
benefit their family members, and other stakeholders engaged in different
busniess activities, he added.

A total of 40 applicants, including 18 women, whose loan applications fulfilling
codal formalities were accepted also attended the function and replied to the
queries of Prime Minister. Nawaz Sharif said the government had launched the
scheme to improve the economic condition of the youth, who would be given loans
ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 2 million.

The government realised that the country's educated and uneducated youth had no
access to financial opportunities for their economic empowerment. No development
could be achieved without active participation of the youth, he said and added
the government had decided to make the future builders financially strong.

He said youth were the major contributors to the development of any country and
the government was determined to open vistas for them, who remained neglected so
far. In the past, big loans, amounting upto Rs 20 billion were being granted to
individuals or groups, but the youth were ignored, he said.

The Prime Minister said the present government was determined to remove the
sense of deprivation among the youth by supporting them. Nawaz Sharif said a
transparent policy had been formed for granting loans to the deserving youth
purely on merit and no pressure would be tolerated.

Even he himself could not assert pressure on the authorities concerned in giving
loans, he said and added only those would avail the facility who had
comprehensive plans to start their business. The Prime Minister said the scheme
was actually conceived during his last tenure, but it could not be launched due
to unavoidable circumstances.

He said he had never forgotten the scheme and committed to the youth during his
recent election campaign. Now, the youth would soon reap its benefits. The
scheme would bring a great change in the socio- economic conditions of the
people in about a year. It would not only gear up economic activities, but also
help improve the gross domestic product, he added.

He criticised those who were trying to mislead the youth by making propaganda
against the scheme. He called upon the youth not to pay any heed to them and
work for the country's progress and prosperity by availing the opportunity.
Recalling the Yellow Cab Scheme launched during his second tenure, the Prime
Minister said it proved very successful as 99 percent recovery rate had been
achieved.

He expressed the hope that after getting loan, the youth would work hard to
promote their businesses and return their liabilities within scheduled time. The
Prime Minister said the youth through their hard work would help government
launch development projects in every nook and corner of the country.

He said the government had decided to launch Karachi Circular Railways and he
had already chaired a meeting in this regard. He said the government was
determined to serve the masses without discrimination and was making decisions
purely on merit. The time was not far when the people would enjoy the fruit of
his efforts.

He said Sindh had played a great role after the creation of Pakistan as it
welcomed all those wholeheartedly, who came here after migration from other
parts of the Sub-continent. The Prime Minister said under Youth Business Scheme,
the youth would have to repay the loan within eight years and no recovery would
be made during the first year.

Realizing the difficulties of the youth in getting guarantors, he said the
government had made some relaxation in that respect. The applicants could now
name their relatives as guarantors. They could also furnish the guarantee of
government officers of Grade-15 or above. The applicants could also produce the
guarantee of more than one person and even they could get loan against moveable
and immoveable property worth 1.5 (one point five) times more than the required
amount, he said.

He said the condition of having bank account with National Bank of Pakistan had
also been relaxed and now those having accounts with other banks could also
apply. He said that under directives of the Prime Minister and Chairperson of
the Prime Minister's Youth Development Programme, Maryam Nawaz, a transparent
policy had been framed for granting loan.

Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held direct interaction with the applicants,
who were selected for grant of loan after completion of required formalities.

Ignorance costs women and youths cheap business funds

BYLINE: Kinuthia Mburu -1

LENGTH: 1529  words


Loans from the Women Enterprise, Youth, and Uwezo funds provide affordable and
convenient credit to entrepreneurs and groups. So why is the uptake so low?

Have you or your chama considered applying for a group loan from the Women
Enterprise Development, Youth Enterprise, or Uwezo funds?

We posed this question to many women running or seeking to start businesses in
various parts of the country:

"No," replied Mercy Rotich from Nakuru. "But I belong to an investment group of
15 members. It's called Rafiki Women's Group. We contribute Sh1,000 every month,
then cast ballots to determine who takes the whole Sh15,000."

Ms Rotich adds that the Women Fund has never been an agenda in their group
meetings. "We don't see it as a highly profitable investment booster," she says.

On the other hand, Keziah Wafula, a cereals wholesaler in Bungoma, who is a
member of Uhusiano Mwema Women's Group, quotes high interest rates charged by
banks as the reason her group cannot apply for a loan. Ironically, Ms Wafula
completed her Sh330,000 bank loan in November last year at 16 per cent interest
rate.

Although the Santa Cruz Youth Group in Siaya has applied for a Youth Enterprise
Fund loan before, they will not be putting in an application to the Uwezo Fund.

According to group member Freddy Odhiambo, the reason is the frustration they
felt on being disqualified for a Youth Enterprise Fund loan.

"We have applied for youth loans for the past four years without success. In
every application, we are told that we didn't qualify or that our documents were
not filled correctly!" he says.

Apparently, many women and youth groups remain unaware of the potential these
funds hold or are too frustrated to pursue these cheap loans.

In the past seven years, the Women Enterprise Development Fund has disbursed
Sh381.4 million to 67,799 women in various constituencies across the country.

In a growing economy where small businesses are increasingly expressing a hunger
for financial support and/or start-up capital, these figures betray an apathy to
loans among small-scale business owners.

INACCESIBLE CASH

Take the Youth Enterprise Fund. Despite the fact that this fund has been in
operation since 2006, many youths have remained out of work and unable to access
cash even though the fund provides start-up capital to applicable and promising
business proposals.

As we found out, many young people believe that only youth-owned existing
businesses are eligible for Youth Fund loans.

Moses Masai, 28, has been jobless for the past eight years that the Youth Fund
has been lending money. Over the same period, loans worth more than Sh9.3
billion have bypassed him.

In mid-February this year, the Women Development Fund released Sh3.8 billion for
disbursement to 800,000 women across the country.

According to Ms Catherine Omuya, the CEO of the Youth Enterprise Fund, strategic
partnership with the private sector has seen the fund create a Sh9.3 billion
portfolio, up from the Sh4.2 billion offered by the government.

By December 2013, Sh9.3 billion had been disbursed. This came hot on the heels
of the Sh6 billion Uwezo Fund - a distinct and independent youth and women
enterprise funding entity.

According to personal finance expert James Njenga, release of these monies
provides a cheaper alternative to funding that investment groups can use.

"The interest rates charged on women and youth funds are relatively lower than
those charged by banks. Instead of going for an expensive bank loan, women
entrepreneurs and the youth will do well to grasp these monies while they last,"
he says.

In Ol Kalou, groups of women from Karau, Rurii, and Kaimbaga locations are doing
exactly that. They formed a women's sacco called Karuka Jubilee Women Sacco in
August last year. They have contributed and disbursed loans worth Sh680,000 at
10 per cent interest rate.

"We bring together different groups of 10 members and above," says Miriam
Wanjiru, a member. "Then we pool money through individual contributions. The
minimal amount a member can contribute is Sh200. Every member gets a maximum
loan that is three times her six months' contribution."

The women's sacco hosts 152 groups. Wanjiru says that by joining a group and
registering with Karuka, she was able to access a loan of Sh30,000.

"I got an individual loan through the group and bought a cow. I now sell milk to
Brookside Dairy," she says. The loans are provided through Tower Savings and
Credit Sacco, Nyandarua County's premier teachers saving society.

Mr Stephen Kibet is one of the young entrepreneurs who have used the Youth
Enterprise Fund to expand his business. "I took a loan of Sh150,000 in 2009
under a youth group in my church and started a jua kali workshop.

"I have been building and selling ventilators and metallic boxes. My business
has grown from the Sh150,000 capital to a turnover of Sh600,000 and I have
employed two workers," says Kibet.

He says that had his group not visited one of the financing intermediaries to
understand how the loans work, they would not have applied for it. "Initially,
we thought the loans were similar to those of commercial banks since they were
being offered by banks and saccos," he says.

Currently, Kibet and his youth group are planning to reap big from the Uwezo
Fund. "These are cheap funding opportunities that no young entrepreneur can
afford to miss."

GOVERNMENT TENDERS

According to Ms Wanjiru Gathira, chairperson of Uwezo Fund, access to finance is
being tagged on the 30 per cent procurement of government tenders offered to
women and the youth.

"The fund will enable young people to become shareholders and will give them a
larger market for their products," she said. "It seeks to model an alternative
framework for funding community projects initiated by young people."

Interestingly, 40 per cent of the Sh6 billion on offer will be grants. "Sh2.4
billion is to be distributed without interest. This means that borrowers will
repay only the principal. You can't get such an offer from any bank," says
Njenga.

According to the Cabinet secretary for Devolution, Ms Ann Waiguru, beneficiaries
of the interest-free money will be determined on a needs basis and the strength
of the proposals presented.

The remaining Sh3.6 billion will be distributed to qualified groups through
constituencies at concessional interest rates.

To qualify, youths will be required to form groups of 10 people or more. Sh4.5
billion or 75 per cent of the money will be shared equally among the counties
while Sh600 million will help offer business skills.

The remaining Sh900 million will be allocated on a quota basis, with the youths
living in the poorest counties receiving more money.

Njenga explains that if you borrow from Uwezo as a group, you will be expected
to apply principles associated with table banking. The table banking programme
was launched by the government through the Poverty Eradication Commission with
the aim of helping women access start-up funds for income-generating
enterprises.

Joyful Women Organisation from Uasin Gishu is one group that is reaping the
fruits of the table banking concept. After starting with a revolving fund of Sh6
million, the group has seen its wealth increase to Sh425 million in four years,
with a membership growth of 100,000 women from 1,000 founding members.

The Uwezo Fund will offer loans starting from Sh50,000 and not exceeding
Sh500,000. In the 2013/14 financial year, the interest rate charged stands at 0
per cent.

According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Devolution late last year,
the interest rate for the fund would be reviewed annually but would not exceed 1
per cent.

Under the Youth Enterprise Fund, income generating projects are funded up to Sh3
million. "The fund charges an annual interest rate of 8 per cent," says Njenga.

Unlike Uwezo Fund, the youth fund offers loans to individual businesses or
promising business proposals.

Wanjiru (of Karuka group) explains that groups must have a working contribution
and a borrowing and repayment formula before applying for these loans.

"This will keep the money flowing and ensure that groups do not incur bad debts.
This is what we did. Now we are even considering bringing in men," she says.

MONEY MATTERS

Court to decide on Musharraf's Nov 3 actions: Nawaz

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 804

LENGTH: 650  words


Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday that the matter of Pervez
Musharraf's treason trial was sub-judice and perhaps it might be inappropriate
for him to say any thing on this matter. Talking to a private news channel, the
prime minister however said apart from merit of the case, he will like to say
that the plaintiff in the case is the state of Pakistan and the Constitution of
Pakistan.

He said the court will have to decide whether the state of Pakistan was insulted
on Nov 03, or not. He said it is up to the court to decide whether the Nov 3
step comes under the sphere of Article 6, or not. "I also want to say that this
case is not about a single person," the prime minister said.

"It must also be decided at this juncture of history that whether we are a
responsible democratic state having out own constitution, law and our system, or
not.

He said if everyone is equal before the law then every citizen should also be
answerable before the law. "It is the court's duty to decide whether he is
guilty or innocent," Nawaz said.

Youth loan scheme to help alleviate poverty: Nawaz

APP adds: Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday the youth loan
programme would help alleviate poverty in the country. Addressing the launching
ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth Loan Programme organized by National Bank of
Pakistan (NBP) here at Okara Sports Complex, he said loans would help people
send their children to school and become useful members of society. The Prime
Minister said Rs 100 billion allocation for the loan scheme reflected his trust
in youth, who would put the country on the road to progress. He said youth had
immense potential and could play a positive role in the country's progress. The
youth remained deprived of their right to progress during last 65 years and the
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government decided to bring them into the
mainstream by providing financial facilities through the banking sector.

Even developed countries like Japan, Germany and Britain had provided financial
assistance to the youth to enable them set up their own businesses, he added.

"Only those countries made progress that followed the constitution in letter and
spirit. I belive the 60 percent youth population will not let us down and make
the country proud," he added.

He said he wanted to launch the youth loan scheme in 1999, but was stopped by
former dictator General Pervez Musharraf from serving the youth.

He said the loan scheme was for the whole country, including Federally
Administred Tribal Areas, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab.

The Prime Minister said he had started the loan scheme from Hyderabad and was
pleased to fulfil his promise made during the election campaign.

He said some people were opposing the loan scheme for their vested interests.
They were not ready to trust the youth. In fact, such elements were themselves
not worthy enough to be trusted.

Nawaz Sharif said the government had decided to relax some conditions for
getting loan. Now a blood relation could become a guarantor for a loan seeker.
Government officers of Grade 15 and above were also allowed to sign a loan
guarantee.

Nawaz Sharif said half a million youth would benefit from the loan scheme in the
first phase while the facility would be extended to some 5 million in later
stages.

He said he would himself visit all divisional headquarters to monitor
transperancy in the loan process.

The Prime Minister, later, mingled with the youth and asked them about the
problems in availing the loan facility. He assured them that there would be no
compromise on merit.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairman Board of Directors of NBP Munir Kamal said
progress in the country was not possible without uplifting small businessmen.

The Prime Minister directed SMEDA and National Bank authorities to address
problems of loan applicants.

FSA Youth Operating Loan rates at 1.75 percent for October

BYLINE: Greeley Tribune, Colo.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 263 words


Oct. 02--Officials with the Weld County Farm Service Agency Farm Loan Program
announced this week that the October interest rate for the Youth Annual
Operating and Youth Term Operating loans is 1.75 percent fixed for seven years.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's FSA makes loans up to $5,000 to individual
rural youth to establish and operate income-producing projects of modest size in
connection with their participation in 4-H clubs, FFA and similar organizations.
The Youth Direct Farm Operating Loans' repayment terms may vary, but typically
will not exceed seven years for intermediate-term purposes. Annual operating
loans are generally repaid within 12 months or when the commodities produced are
sold. Youth loans may be used to buy livestock, equipment and supplies; buy,
rent, or repair tools and equipment; and pay operating expenses for running the
project.

Youth must be between 10 and 20 years old, be a citizen of the U.S. and be able
to conduct a modest income-producing project in a supervised program of work.
The youth must also be capable of planning, managing and operating the project
under guidance and assistance from a project adviser. The project adviser must
recommend the project and the loan, and also agree to provide adequate
supervision.

For more information about the Farm Service Agency loan program, contact the
local FSA office at (970) 356-8097, or visit online at www.fsa.usda.gov.

Pakistan: Even I cannot favour anyone in loan scheme: Nawaz

LENGTH: 696  words

DATELINE: HYDERABAD


HYDERABAD, Jan. 5 -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday said that the
disbursements under the Youth Business Loan Scheme would be made transparently
and violators of merit would be dealt with strictly as neither he nor any
authority in the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) could favour anyone to get loan
under this scheme and even he did not have such powers.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of the Youth Business Scheme here at the
Hyderabad Club, he said the government had decided to empower the among the
youth by supporting them.

Nawaz Sharif said that the country could achieve tremendous development by
harnessing the youth's talent and energy who formed 60 percent of the
population.

This would not only help improve the socio economic condition of the youth but
also directly benefit the members of their family and other stakeholders engaged
in different business activities, he added. A total of 40 applicants including
18 women whose loan applications fulfilling the codal formalities were accepted
also attended the function and replied to the queries of the prime minister.

Nawaz Sharif said that the government had launched the scheme to improve the
economic condition of the youth who would be given loans ranging from Rs100 000
to Rs2 million. The government realised that the country's educated and
uneducated youth had no access to financial opportunities for their economic
empowerment. No development could be achieved without active participation of
the youth, he said and added that the government had decided to make the future
builders financially strong. He said the youth were the major contributors to
the development of any country and the government was determined to open vistas
for them who remained neglected so far. In the past big loans amounting to Rs20
billion were being granted to individuals or groups but the youth were ignored,
he said.

Describing it as social cancer the prime minister expressed the government's
resolve to curb favouritism vowing to enforce the merit policy at all costs. He
said he had envisioned the loan scheme during his previous tenure but it could
not be materialised as the government could not complete its term. He said the
loan scheme would help boost the country's GDP and support the families of
borrowers as well as of those allied with their businesses.

He recalled that the recovery rate of Yellow Cab Scheme was almost 99 percent
and hoped that the youngsters would also pay back this loan honestly. The prime
minister said the conditions for guarantors in the loan scheme had been eased
keeping in view the difficulties being faced by the youth. Now anyone including
the blood relatives having net worth of 1.5 times of the loan amount could give
the guarantee. Moreover any government officer of Grade 15 with eight or more
years of remaining service could be a guarantor, he added. He said even more
than one person with cumulative net worth of more than 1.5 times of the loan
amount could give collective guarantees for a single applicant. Even the
applicant having required net worth could give his own guarantee. The applicant
could have his bank account in any bank including National Bank of Pakistan, the
prime minister said.

He said, "We have to trust the youth and give them financial independence to
play a positive role in the national economy. The prime minister said that in
the past loans were given only to influential ones and entities while the small
borrowers were neglected. "We have decided to give loans to small borrowers in
order to give benefit to the skilled youth and lower strata of the society. This
is a programme launched for the youth who are the builders of Pakistan," he
said.

Later the prime minister met the applicants and inquired about their plans after
getting the loan. The applicants enthusiastically interacted with the prime
minister and said the loan scheme would help them utilise their skills not only
for own benefit but also for families and the society

Selangor to sue youths for recovery of trust fund loan

SECTION: National; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 373 words

DATELINE: Klang


KLANG, Tues. - The Selangor Government will take legal action against
those who have failed to pay back their loans taken from the State Youth
Trust Fund.

State youth, sports and tourism committee chairman Abdul Fatah Iskandar
said warning notices would be sent to the borrowers soon. Borrowers still
owe the fund more than RM400,000.

He said drastic action had to be taken because checks showed that most
of the defaulters were already in a position to repay their loans.

Many of them, he said, were now successful entrepreneurs in various
fields.

"Many reminders have been sent to them to repay their loans but to date
many have yet to do so. By refusing to service their loans, these young
entrepreneurs have denied others from enjoying the facilities provided by
the revolving fund.

"To date, loans amounting to more than RM600,000 have been given to
youths in the State under the youth entrepreneurship programme, small
industry programme and youth in agriculture programme," he said, adding
that until June only RM118,396 had been recovered from the borrowers.

The fund with an initial grant of RM1 million was set up in 1992 by the
State Government to encourage youth participation in business and
agriculture on a big scale.

Under the three programmes, eligible youths can borrow between RM10,000
and RM50,000 to expand their activities.

Abdul Fatah said the State Government had no other recourse to recover
the loans which had been in arrears for up to 30 months except by taking
legal action against the defaulters.

"Those who are facing cash-flow problems and have difficulties in
servicing their loans should get in touch with the State Government to
discuss their problem.

"Consideration to extend the loan repayment period can be given on a
case-by-case basis, provided they make a formal appeal to the State
Government," he said.

He said the State Government would also help the Youth and Sports
Ministry recover payments from youths in the State who have taken loans
under the ministry's Youth Economic Development Trust Fund.

He said the State Government through district youth offices would liaise
with the ministry to identify those who had yet to repay their loans.

Youth Fund to Stop Dealing With Banks

BYLINE: Mathews Ndanyi

LENGTH: 337 words


THE Youth Enterprise Development Fund will directly disburse loans to youth
especially in rural areas which lack financial institutions. The fund will allow
youth to directly apply for loans instead of going through banks. Many youth
have expressed difficulty in accessing banks or financial institutions to get
the loans.

The Fund's chief executive Juma Mwatata said many youth groups wanted the
procedures used for giving out the loans to be simplified because they feel
procedures at some of the banks are lengthy and complicated for them.

However, he said they had put in place measures to ensure that the loans are
given out in a structured way for easy monitoring and repayment. Some of the
youth groups have complained that they are unable to go through the
bureaucracies of accessing the loans through banks or other financial
institutions. "That is why we will also have to look at the possibility of
directly dealing with the youth groups so that all youth in the country can
benefit from the money", said Mwatata.

The Youth Fund has so far partnered with 33 financial institutions that help in
disbursing the loans. According to the latest progress report, the fund has so
far advanced loans worthy Sh5.2 Billion to 144,000 youth enterprises. In the
report, the fund has mentioned inadequate disbursement and repayment structures
in rural areas hence the consideration for direct funding of groups.

The youth in areas where there are no financial institutions are greatly
disadvantaged and Minister for Youth Paul Otuoma says they are focusing on
identifying alternative ways of availing its products to youth in rural areas.
He says in the report that the focus is to reach as many youth as possible in
all parts of the country. But in some areas, youth have failed to form groups
through which they can access money given to constituencies as revolving funds.

For example, in Eldoret East Constituency, area MP Professor Margaret Kamar,
says only 30 per cent of the money give to the area has been loaned out to
youth.

Bui Youth Reluctant to Pay Pajer-U Gratis Loans

BYLINE: Peter Adi Fonte

LENGTH: 380 words


The National coordinator of the Urban and Rural programme support for youth
abbreviated (PAJER-U) Mr. Matongo Pierre led a team of officials of PAJER-U from
Yaounde and the North West Region to sensitize youth in Bui division who owe the
PAJER-U loans given out to them since 2010 on gratis to reimburse their loans or
face repressive recovery methods. The sensitization meeting that took place in
Kumbo on the 9th of April 2014 was presided over by the second Assistant Prefect
for Bui Mr. Meke Brice Olinga listened to reimbursement reports presented by the
sub divisional delegates of youth Affairs and civic Education for Kumbo , Jakiri
, Oku, Noni and Nkum subdivisions. In all the reports presented the youth who
owe the PAJER-U loans were very reluctant and slow to reimburse their various
loans obtained on gratis.

It was revealed during the meeting that out of a total loan of 51.5million
francs grated to the youth of Bui only a meager sum of 7.6million francs has so
far been reimburse.some of the youth are so recalcitrant that they have so far
reimburse nothing at all.

Speaking at the occasion Mr. Meke Brice Olinga said the PAJKER-U programme was
put in place to promote and empower youth to be self employed even though they
are not taking it seriously. He told the youth that by refusing to pay back the
loan they are blocking the chances of other youth as the money was meant to
revolve and assist other youth. He told the beneficiaries to be duty conscious
and repay the money before government embark on repressive recovery methods of
the money as some of them would be arrested and prosecuted. He reminded the
beneficiaries to use the loans for the purpose it was destined for.

The National coordinator of PAJER-U Mr. Matongo Pierrre in his speech made it
clear to the PAJER-U loan defaulters that it was the last time the team was
coming out to sensitize them to reimburse their delinquent loans. He told them
that the loan scheme was not for a durable project. He called on them to air out
the problems they face in reimbursing the loans. He said the next outing will be
to arrest the defaulters of the loans.

Some of them complained of their savings in the FIFA bank account and Insurance
they insured with doing nothing to pay for loss incurred in animal rearing.

Calling upon the unemployed youth to take full advantage of the PM's Youth
Business Loan Scheme, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has declared the applications
for business loans would be decided purely on merit basis regardless of the
applicant's affiliation with any political party or group. "The top government
functionaries including even the prime minister would not be able to recommend a
person seeking loan under this scheme".

Premier Nawaz Sharif announced this while addressing a gathering of the loan
seekers from Malakand division and Dir at Swat on Wednesday morning. Besides, a

inquired about their plans for business.

Nawaz Sharif said all provinces would get equitable share under the PM's Youth
Business Loan Scheme and the loans would be dispensed in accordance with the
population ratio of each province.

"If the received applicants from a province are less in number, the other
provinces would not fill the gap and instead the loans for that particular
province would be transferred to next month". Prime minister elaborated. He said
share of each province has been fixed according to the ratio of population.

Nawaz Sharif said his government was determined to give utmost support and
patronage to the youth of this country and as a prime minister it was his
responsibility to ensure the implementation of this agenda. He, however, urged
the youth to get self-reliant by prudently utilizing the business loans and
contribute to the national economy.

Prime Minster Sharif also advised the youth of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and
particularly those belonging to Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) to
take maximum benefit from PM's Youth Business Loan scheme as they had faced huge
challenges in the recent past and rendered sacrifices for ensure lasting pace
their area.

Nawaz said this was the first time that banks were catering to common people
seeking loans adding that eighty per cent people in China, America, United
Kingdom, France and Germany belonged to middle class who had a major
contribution to the economies of their countries.

He declared in categorical tone that the applications for business loans would
be decided purely on merit regardless of affiliation with any political group
and neither prime minister nor a minister could recommend a person seeking loan
under this scheme.

"I am personally monitoring the loan scheme and efforts will be made to further
expand and improve this scheme to make it a success story". Nawaz Sharif said
adding certain conditions for the loans have been relaxed while reviewing
matters relating to the loan guarantee.

Paying tributes to the people of Swat for rendering matchless sacrifices for the
revival of peace in the areaâ(EURO)s the Prime Minister said the people of
Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and tribal areas need this scheme the most to rebuild their
lives hence the youth must take full advantage of Youth Business Loans to stand
on their own feet and put their full share in the speedy development of the
country.

Youth Programme, meeting with a delegation of World Bank

SECTION: Vol. 14 No. 346

LENGTH: 446  words


Chairperson Prime Minister's Youth Programme, Ms Leila Khan Thursday held a
meeting here with a delegation of World Bank led by Ms Theresa Paulelle Jones.

According to a press release issued here on Thursday, Ms Leila Khan apprised the
delegation, Federal Government is running six (6) schemes under Prime Minister's
Youth Programme.

These schemes include Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans Scheme, Prime
Minister's Interest Free Loan Scheme, Prime Minister's Youth Skill Development
Programme, Prime Minister's Youth Laptop Scheme, Prime Minister's Fee
Reimbursement Scheme, and Prime Minister's Youth Training Scheme. She expressed
her desire to engage international development partners

like World Bank, Asian Development Bank, USAID, IDB, Saudi Development Fund and
DFID for enhancing the scope and impact of these schemes, which were already
being run successfully now.

She explained, We have so far disbursed more than 6,500 business loans worth Rs
5.8 billion in potential entrepreneurs aged 21-45 years across the country under
Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans Scheme; whereas under Prime Minister's
Interest Free Loan Scheme around 100,000 interest free loans worth more than Rs.
2 Billion have been granted to poorest of the poor people in 44 under developed
districts across Pakistan.

Moreover, out of the 100,000 Interest Free Loan beneficiaries, around 25,000
were those who had a poverty score of less than 16.17 and were BISP
beneficiaries, she added.

These people are graduated from the BISP programme and have obtained PM Interest
Free Loan in order to become self-sustainable and start earning their
livelihood.

Prime Minister's Youth Skill Development Programme has trained 25,000 youth in
more than 100 demand-driven trades in Phase-I, and is currently training another
25,000 trainees under Phase-II of the Programme,  Ms Leila Khan added, She
highlighted that skilled training was imparted to people so that they could use
these skills and start a small level enterprise after securing loan under PM
Interest Free Loan scheme.

Chairperson Prime Minister's Youth Programme highlighted that Prime Minister's
Youth Laptop and Prime Minister's Fee Reimbursement Schemes were focusing on
promotion of higher education among youth.

Under Prime Minister's Youth Laptop Scheme, the government has so far
distributed around 100,000 laptops in MS/MPhil, PhD, Masters', and Bachelors'
students enrolled in HEC-recognized public sector universities and colleges
across the country whereas under Prime Minister's Fee Reimbursement Scheme fee

Youth self-employment program falls flat

LENGTH: 387 words

DATELINE: JUMLA


JUMLA, Feb. 3 -- Implementation of the Youth Self Employment Program (YSEP)
initiated by the government to generate employment for youths in Jumla district
has failed to deliver results.

Through the Youth Self Employment Fund (YSEF), youths were given away
collateral-free loans to help them establish small businesses to generate income
for themselves. However, neither the program succeeded in creating employments
nor are there any signs of the youths paying back the easy loans provided to
them.

Under the YSEP, the Jumla branch of Agriculture Development Bank (ADB) had
issued loans ranging from Rs 30,000-40,000 to 72 youths in the district. But
only two of them turn up at the branch regularly to return the money in
installments, according to Gorakh Bahadur Budhthapa, loan executive at ADB,
Jumla.

He is disappointed with the beneficiary youths who have refused to pay back the
money even after frequent follow-ups.

"The youths were enthusiastic at the time of receiving the money. But since then
they have been acting in an indifferent manner," Budhthapa said.

According to Budhthapa, although the youths had committed in writing that they
would use the fund for income-generating ventures, most of them have misused it.
It is learnt that loans amounting to a total of Rs 11.3 million have been issued
through four cooperative organizations in Jumla district.

The loans under the YSEP were issued to those local youths who had received
self-employment certificates provided by the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (FNCCI).

But now recovering the loans is proving a difficult task, according to officials
at ADB, Jumla.

Visiting YSEF beneficiaries in person to force them to repay the loans is
difficult in Jumla due to the place's complicated geography. Moreover, there is
a belief among some youths that the loans would be waived this year, too, just
like in the past.

Meanwhile, the central office of ADB in Kathmandu has already instructed its
district office to recover the loans at any cost.

Lack of proper mechanism and monitoring rendered the program ineffective, say
ADB officials in the district.

have also benefited from the scheme. The recovery rate of the scheme is 99
percent. A milestone of reaching out to 300,000 borrowers will be achieved by
June 30, 2017.

unemployed youth of Pakistan with middle level education for acquiring
productive skills for gainful employment. So far, technical/vocational training
to 75,000 youths, both men and women, has been imparted.

However, the project will train another 100,000 people by June this year. The
PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme is focused on unemployed youths, especially the
educated ones looking for establishing or extending business enterprises.

So far, business loans to the tune of Rs. 17.043 billion have been disbursed
among 17,045 potential entrepreneurs. Recovery rate of the scheme is 94 percent.
Eighteen partner banks of the scheme are processing the loan applications as per
their established banking procedures. Loans are granted after the satisfactory
completion of all the formalities of the bank.

The PM's laptop scheme is aimed at spreading the use of computers amongst the
college/university level students for the pursuit of higher education and
research. So far, almost 200,000 laptops have been distributed among students of
PhD, MPhil, MS, masters' and bachelors' program of Higher Education Commission
(HEC) recognized universities across Pakistan. Milestone of distributing 300,000
laptops among university students will be achieved by June.

Public seems more worried than happy over PM's loan scheme

BYLINE:  Staff Report

SECTION: Vol. X No. 251

LENGTH: 983  words


Recently Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated the Business Loan Scheme for
the youth with the hope that it would open new avenues for the educated but
unsettled, unemployed and jobless youths who are looking for establishing or
extending their business enterprises.

The prime minister's scheme comprises youth business loans, youth training
scheme, youth skills development scheme, laptops scheme, and the scheme for
reimbursement of dues of students from backward areas of the country. All men
and women holding a CNIC, aged between 21 and 45 years, having entrepreneurial
potential can apply for the prime minister's Youth Business Loan scheme.

Under the loan scheme 350,000 youth will be given loans. As the first step, the
government plans to disburse Rs 100 billion among 100,000 loan-seekers who will
be able to apply for a sum between Rs 100,000 to Rs 2 million. Maryam Safdar,
elder daughter of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has been appointed as chairperson
of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme. She will be acting as focal person with
the onus to administer, coordinate, manage and supervise the implementation of
the programme.

While inaugurating the programme, the prime minister said that through the
business loan scheme he wanted to enable the youth to play a positive and active
role in the progress and prosperity of the country. Interestingly, a major focus
on women has been stressed under this scheme as some 50 percent of loans will go
to women borrowers, while 5% quota has been allocated to families of shaheeds,
widows and disabled persons.

The launch of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme has generated
excitement and is a ray of hope, particularly for the unemployed youth, as the
programme plans to help and encourage educated, energetic but poor people of
Pakistan.

The initiative has attracted a good number of loan seekers, as a spokesperson
for the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA) told Daily
Times that they had recorded around 5.5 million downloads of forms for the
scheme until now, and the number of applicants is increasing.

However, the terms and conditions of the youth scheme launched by the government
are not in favour of majority of the people, especially the poorer class. Not
only favourable conditions but transparency and easy accessibility are
essentials to the success of such a programme. Another crucial factor is the
creation of a favourable environment for loan utilisation. Both transparent
accessibility to loans and favourable environment for their utilisation are yet
to be ensured to the unskilled and unsettled youth, as corruption, favouritism
as well as terrorism have badly engulfed the whole country.

The government, however, seems striving seriously to resolve the matter of tough
conditions for the loan and might come up with a genuine solution soon, as Prime
Minister Nawaz seems very committed to the scheme. He is always in touch with
the chairperson of the scheme and conducting meetings to review the programme.
Surely, he cannot see a project headed by his daughter, Maryam, fall apart.

Initially, the aspirants download application forms from the National Bank of
Paksitan website and the website of SMEDA. The form has three pages. Two pages
require personal information while the third is about two references and one
guarantor.

The NBP has issued another form, "guarantor consent form", which requires that
the applicant provide the guarantee of some one with some solid financial
background, or a collateral of 150 percent unmovable property against the loan.

The form demands guarantee from a government servant of BPS-15. This is
definitely not possible for a common and poor man or woman to achieve. In either
case the guarantee is needed from a rich person who should have at least
one-and-a-half times the money against which the loan is sought.

It is partially possible but not easy for poor people. Besides, a guarantor is
required to undergo a strict official verification process and sign an agreement
that partially serves NBP interests.

In short, the guarantor has to accept responsibility for repayment of the loan
in case of default, and this discourages people from becoming guarantors. KD
Kalandrani, a philosophy student at FCC Lahore, suggests, "The prime minister
should consider simplification of the procedure enabling the youth to obtain
loans from banks easily. Provincial governments can stand as guarantors for such
loans."

Another student, Zaheer, insists, "The loan scheme seems more suitable for those
who are already in business as businessmen do not need to worry about finding a
guarantor; they can collateralise their loans." He adds, "They are money-bagged;
they have everything, but what do the poor guys have except a small house, with
no property." Latif Ahmed, a bachelor from Azad Jammu and Kashmir who runs a
headdress shop in Barket Market, Lahore, says, "I wanted to apply for the loan
to extend my business, but how would a poor applicant like me from a rural area
manage a guarantor under BS-15, as I neither have any employed relative nor a
friend?" With these conditions, he said, one can assume that the loan scheme is
meant to benefit only the rich class.

Not so, says Majid Baloch, a sociology student at the Punjab University.
"Finding a guarantor shouldn't be that much of a troublesome job because if a
loan seeker has a good business plan, it should not be difficult for him to
persuade someone to be his/her guarantor or else no one should have any doubt or
fear to become his/her guarantor," he added. The banks on the other hand seem
reluctant to participate in this scheme. A private bank manager told Daily
Times, "I'd rather the government spared us. But if we're forced to join it, we
will demand two things: one, the guarantors should be made liable to pay the
defaulted amount; two, the government should share losses with the banks."

role in the progress and prosperity of the country. Interestingly, a major focus
on women has been stressed under this scheme as some 50 percent of loans will go
to women borrowers, while 5% quota has been allocated to families of shaheeds,
widows and disabled persons.

The launch of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme has generated
excitement and is a ray of hope, particularly for the unemployed youth, as the
programme plans to help and encourage educated, energetic but poor people of
Pakistan.

The initiative has attracted a good number of loan seekers, as a spokesperson
for the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA) told Daily
Times that they had recorded around 5.5 million downloads of forms for the
scheme until now, and the number of applicants is increasing.

However, the terms and conditions of the youth scheme launched by the government
are not in favour of majority of the people, especially the poorer class. Not
only favourable conditions but transparency and easy accessibility are
essentials to the success of such a programme. Another crucial factor is the
creation of a favourable environment for loan utilisation. Both transparent
accessibility to loans and favourable environment for their utilisation are yet
to be ensured to the unskilled and unsettled youth, as corruption, favouritism
as well as terrorism have badly engulfed the whole country.

The government, however, seems striving seriously to resolve the matter of tough
conditions for the loan and might come up with a genuine solution soon, as Prime
Minister Nawaz seems very committed to the scheme. He is always in touch with
the chairperson of the scheme and conducting meetings to review the programme.
Surely, he cannot see a project headed by his daughter, Maryam, fall apart.

Initially, the aspirants download application forms from the National Bank of
Paksitan website and the website of SMEDA. The form has three pages. Two pages
require personal information while the third is about two references and one
guarantor.

The NBP has issued another form, "guarantor consent form", which requires that
the applicant provide the guarantee of some one with some solid financial
background, or a collateral of 150 percent unmovable property against the loan.

The form demands guarantee from a government servant of BPS-15. This is
definitely not possible for a common and poor man or woman to achieve. In either
case the guarantee is needed from a rich person who should have at least
one-and-a-half times the money against which the loan is sought.

It is partially possible but not easy for poor people. Besides, a guarantor is
required to undergo a strict official verification process and sign an agreement
that partially serves NBP interests.

In short, the guarantor has to accept responsibility for repayment of the loan
in case of default, and this discourages people from becoming guarantors. KD
Kalandrani, a philosophy student at FCC Lahore, suggests, "The prime minister
should consider simplification of the procedure enabling the youth to obtain
loans from banks easily. Provincial governments can stand as guarantors for such
loans."

Another student, Zaheer, insists, "The loan scheme seems more suitable for those
who are already in business as businessmen do not need to worry about finding a
guarantor; they can collateralise their loans." He adds, "They are money-bagged;
they have everything, but what do the poor guys have except a small house, with
no property." Latif Ahmed, a bachelor from Azad Jammu and Kashmir who runs a
headdress shop in Barket Market, Lahore, says, "I wanted to apply for the loan
to extend my business, but how would a poor applicant like me from a rural area
manage a guarantor under BS-15, as I neither have any employed relative nor a
friend?" With these conditions, he said, one can assume that the loan scheme is
meant to benefit only the rich class.

Not so, says Majid Baloch, a sociology student at the Punjab University.
"Finding a guarantor shouldn't be that much of a troublesome job because if a
loan seeker has a good business plan, it should not be difficult for him to
persuade someone to be his/her guarantor or else no one should have any doubt or
fear to become his/her guarantor," he added. The banks on the other hand seem
reluctant to participate in this scheme. A private bank manager told Daily
Times, "I'd rather the government spared us. But if we're forced to join it, we
will demand two things: one, the guarantors should be made liable to pay the
defaulted amount; two, the government should share losses with the banks."

Shocking Cabs youth fund loan results - NewsDay Zimbabwe

LENGTH: 393  words


IN what could be described as a shocking development, youths in Mashonaland East
province who benefited from the Cabs youth loan scheme, have this year paid back
only $1 523,36 of the
$680 500 distributed to the province's nine districts.

BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA

Of the 456 loans disbursed, a whopping $678 976,67 is yet to be paid back to the
detriment of other youths, who are on the waiting list.

According to a report in NewsDay's possession, that was handed to Youth and
Indigenisation minister Patrick Zhuwao when he attended a Zanu PF youth league
rally in Marondera last week, two districts have not paid back even a cent since
January this year.

The report said as of February 17, 2016, Goromonzi and Wedza districts, who owed
the scheme $156 671,17 and $31 955,74, respectively, were yet to repay anything
to the revolving fund.

Marondera District, which recorded the highest amount of $670,13 in repaying the
loans, still owed $143 913,49 to the scheme, while second-placed Chivhu District
only returned $287,78 of the $76 459,19 to be paid back to the scheme.

The $10 million Kurera-Ukondla Youth Fund was established in 2011, as part of
Old Mutual's indigenisation agreement with the government, in an effort to
improve levels of employment and act as a stimulus for growth in the country.

Disbursing institutions say about 97% of the youths, who benefited from the
fund, have not paid back.

Addressing youths at Mbuya Nehanda Hall in Marondera recently, Zhuwao pleaded
with them to repay the loans.

"I understand that the youths here need loans to start projects as required by
our indigenisation and empowerment exercise, but according to figures we have
here, a huge sum of money is yet to be repaid," he said.

"Those who are yet to repay the money should do so for the benefit of others.
You cannot expect more money from government at this time."
Most of the youths advocated for the arrest of those defaulting on the loans
repayments.
Of the 60 loans disbursed in Murewa District, only $217,66 of $93 196,75 was
repaid, while Seke District, who got 37 loans only repaid $240,84 of the
$75 200,17.
Mutoko District had this year repaid a paltry $56,95 of the
$61 823,12 from 48 loans disbursed.
Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe District, which got 36 loans, has only repaid a measly
$50 of the
$32 020,89 owed to the scheme.

Youth fund looted - NewsDay Zimbabwe

LENGTH: 665  words


ORAL evidence given before Parliament by Stanbic Bank and Allied Bank yesterday
revealed youth loan funds were looted with some beneficiaries misrepresenting
their ages and addresses, an indication that they intended to avoid paying back.

VENERANDA LANGA

Some of them, including a Zanu PF MP, got more than cut-off amounts of $10 000
per beneficiary.

The Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Parliamentary Portfolio
Committee heard that Zanu PF Mberengwa East MP Makhosini Hlongwane benefited
from a Stanbic Bank youth loan although he did not qualify.

The committee is chaired by Gokwe Nembudziya MP Justice Mayor Wadyajena (Zanu
PF).

Stanbic Bank head of business banking Patson Mahachi told the committee that the
bank had signed an agreement with the ministry to release maximum amounts of
between $5 000 and $10 000 per beneficiary from a $20 million revolving fund.

The beneficiaries of the loans were supposed to be between 21 to 35 years, he
said.

However, MDC-T Mkoba MP Moses Chibaya queried why Hlongwane on June 27 in 2012 -
when he was 38 years old - got a loan of $32 380 for a
bakery project.

"How is it possible that an MP can get a youth loan when legislators do not fall
under the category of disadvantaged youths?" Chibaya charged.

Mahachi said the loans were strictly for people aged from 21 to 35 years, but
added that at times the bank would consider funding potentially-viable projects
with the ability to create employment for other youths.

The MPs said the bank flouted their own regulations as envisaged in the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that they signed with the Indigenisation
ministry stipulating that beneficiaries must be disadvantaged youths aged
between 18 and 35 years.

Other irregularities the committee noted were that Stanbic was given false
addresses and there was double-dipping, while some beneficiaries got loans of up
to $500 000.

But Hlongwane yesterday denied looting the fund.

"I got a loan from Stanbic of $32 000, but I never applied for a youth loan. I
had submitted a loan application to the bank," Hlongwane said.

"If the bank gave me a loan from the youth fund, then that is their problem. I
am prepared to submit my application to Parliament."

Welshman Ncube's MDC MP Jasmine Toffa raised an issue over a loan of $420 000
given to a Bulawayo youth identified only as Dumisani.

She also queried an address, 1060 Lobengula Street in Bulawayo, which she said
was non-existent.

Zanu PF Vungu MP Josphat Madubeko queried why the bulk of the loans were
disbursed to Harare and Mashonaland Provinces, while Zanu PF Mberengwa North MP
Tafanana Zhou sought an explanation over a loan of $150 000 given to a person
named Mussa.

Zhou wanted to know whether the person was Mohammed Mussa, a wealthy
businessman, or another Mussa.

Mahachi said he was going to verify the facts, adding that Harare and
Mashonaland Provinces had submitted many applications.

He said of the $20 million fund, a total of $5,7 million was disbursed and
projects worth $8,7 million declined.

Mahachi said $13 million was still available for loans.

Allied Bank's head of agribusiness James Mada told the committee that in 2010,
the Ministry of Youth ordered Allied Bank to disburse $27 667 to 30 youths from
the Johanne Masowe Wechishanu Apostolic sect for poultry projects.

He, however, said the projects were a complete disaster as all the youths failed
to pay back the loans.

"We even appealed to their leader Lawrence Katsiru (Mashonaland East Zanu PF
political commissar) to force them to re-pay, but this has yielded no results.
We have managed to collect $150 only from three people. We have tried to even
use strong words and threatened them with arrests," Mada said.

Katsiru's two sons, Ignatius and Talent were said to have benefited from the
projects.

Mada said Allied Bank also distributed individual loans worth $18 700 at 10%
interest rates in 2010 and out of 21 beneficiaries, only eight paid back.

He said 13 defaulted and had been since blacklisted at all banks in Zimbabwe.

Public seems more worried than happy over PM's loan scheme

LENGTH: 1019  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Dec. 23 -- Recently Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated the Business
Loan Scheme for the youth with the hope that it would open new avenues for the
educated but unsettled, unemployed and jobless youths who are looking for
establishing or extending their business enterprises.

The prime minister's scheme comprises youth business loans, youth training
scheme, youth skills development scheme, laptops scheme, and the scheme for
reimbursement of dues of students from backward areas of the country. All men
and women holding a CNIC, aged between 21 and 45 years, having entrepreneurial
potential can apply for the prime minister's Youth Business Loan scheme.

Under the loan scheme 350,000 youth will be given loans. As the first step, the
government plans to disburse Rs 100 billion among 100,000 loan-seekers who will
be able to apply for a sum between Rs 100,000 to Rs 2 million. Maryam Safdar,
elder daughter of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has been appointed as chairperson
of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme. She will be acting as focal person with
the onus to administer, coordinate, manage and supervise the implementation of
the programme.

While inaugurating the programme, the prime minister said that through the
business loan scheme he wanted to enable the youth to play a positive and active
role in the progress and prosperity of the country. Interestingly, a major focus
on women has been stressed under this scheme as some 50 percent of loans will go

Youth fund set for overhaul in efficiency quest

BYLINE: OUMA WANZALA

LENGTH: 760  words


Mr Osumba admits that the fund can do better as much as it has registered
notable progress.


The Youth Enterprise Development Fund plans to overhaul the way it disburses
money, chairman Ronald Osumba has announced.
In a status report submitted to the government and dated September 30, Mr Osumba
said that though the fund has had substantial impact, young people are yet to
fully realise its potential.


"There is a need to tailor allocations of the loan given to the youth to
specific and profitable ends," he said in the report.
He went on: "Our youth have stood at the top of the world when called upon to
represent our nation, especially in sports and the arts. We equally owe them the
best that the world can give."
Mr Osumba said it is his desire to transform the fund into an efficient,
responsive and impactful entity that addresses current and future economic
opportunities for young people.
The report also shows that youth in Nairobi have received the lion's share of
loans disbursed by the fund since its inception 10 years ago.
Of the total Sh11.9 billion lent out to 886,313 youth countrywide over the
period, young people in Nairobi have received Sh2.3 billion in various loan
products.
Kiambu County is a distance second, having received loans worth Sh894 million,
followed by Nakuru (Sh746 million), Meru (Sh690 million), Nyandarua (Sh491
million), Uasin Gishu (Sh452 million), Murang'a (Sh427 million) and Mombasa
(Sh410 million).
Those in Samburu County received the least amount at Sh11 million, followed by
Mandera (Sh17 million), Tana River (Sh22 million), Marsabit (Sh23 million), Lamu
(Sh24 million) and Wajir Sh27 million).
The report adds that a total of Sh1.7 billion in loans have been extended to
33,714 youth groups in Nairobi through financial intermediaries, while 349
groups that won government tenders have benefited from Sh205 million in trade
financing.
Another 1,635 loans, amounting to Sh169 million, were extended to the Nairobi
youth in the form of the Constituency Youth Enterprise Scheme, 394 loans worth
Sh21 million through the Easy Youth Enterprise Scheme and another 186 loans
worth Sh123 million through Vuka, a business expansion loan for individuals,
companies, groups and partnerships.
And in what shows the endeavour by urban youth to embrace agriculture, Nairobi
received the second-highest number of loans (31) in the Agri Vijana category,
only second to Kiambu County that got 41 loans.
The fund provides greenhouses alongside certified seeds, drip irrigation systems
and agronomical support on interest-free credit.

DEFAULTS
Nairobi also ranks highly among beneficiaries of poultry incubator loans, a fund
that provides computerized poultry incubators on credit.
Interestingly, though, 18 counties have not received a single shilling in Local
Purchase Oorder financing while only five counties have so far received bid
bonds.
Counties such as Kakamega, Busia, Isiolo, Kisii, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit,
Samburu, Tana River, Wajir, Turkana and West Pokot have also not benefitted from
any greenhouse loans.
According to the youth fund status report, implementation of its programmes has
been hampered by the constant slashing of its annual allocation by the Treasury,
which has seen demand for services overwhelming resources.
Other challenges cited include the massive time and money invested in preparing
the many young people who lack entrepreneurial skills to manage loans, as well
as inadequate financial infrastructure in parts of the country, inhibiting
disbursement and repayment.
"Despite the high uptake of loans, YEDF still experiences defaults, mainly as a
result of lending to a clientele that is perceived to be risky. This eats into
the money available for lending," the report adds.
Mr Osumba admits that the fund can do better as much as it has registered
notable progress.
"We plan to streamline processes to bring in efficiency. We plan to invest in
robust and efficient systems that will lay the foundation for automation and for
availing our services on the mobile phone platform that is popular with our
youth," he says.
"We are also working at matching our turnaround time to the banking sector."

764,153 people have benefited from PM's Youth Programme

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 50

LENGTH: 414  words


Prime Minister's Youth Programme has facilitated as many as 764,153 youths so
far since its announcement by Nawaz Sharif after taking charge of the federal
government in 2013.

The programme was aimed at providing employment opportunities, trainings,
facilitation and many other things to the youths across the country.

It is offering six projects: PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme, PM's Interest Free
Loan Scheme, PM's Youth Development Programme, PM's Programme for Provision of
Laptops to Talented Students, PM's Fee Reimbursement Scheme for Less Developed
Areas and PM's Youth Training Scheme.

The schemes have facilitated around 764,153 people across the country in their
respective fields.

The PM's Interest Free Loan Scheme has provided interest free loans to poorest
of the poor segments of society with a poverty score of up to 40. So far, loans
amounting to Rs 5.815 billion have been disbursed to 261,071 borrowers. Of the
total borrowers, 162,019 are women (62%).

According to data, 54,000 BISP beneficiaries have also benefited from the
scheme. The recovery rate of the scheme is 99 percent. A milestone of reaching
out to 300,000 borrowers will be achieved by June 30, 2017. Similarly, the PM's
Youth Skill Development Programme is aimed at training unemployed youth of
Pakistan with middle level education for acquiring productive skills for gainful
employment. So far, technical/vocational training to 75,000 youths, both men and
women, has been imparted. However, the project will train another 100,000 people
by June this year. The PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme is focused on unemployed
youths, especially the educated ones looking for establishing or extending
business enterprises. So far, business loans to the tune of Rs 17.043 billion
have been disbursed among 17,045 potential entrepreneurs. Recovery rate of the
scheme is 94 percent. Eighteen partner banks of the scheme are processing the
loan applications as per their established banking procedures. Loans are granted
after the satisfactory completion of all the formalities of the bank.

The PM's laptop scheme is aimed at spreading the use of computers amongst the
college/university level students for the pursuit of higher education and
research. So far, almost 200,000 laptops have been distributed among students of
PhD, MPhil, MS, masters' and bachelors' programmes of HEC recognised
universities across Pakistan. Milestone of distributing 300,000 laptops among
university students will be achieved by June.

Youth programmes an appraisal

BYLINE: Malik M Ashraf

SECTION: Vol. 28 No. 80

LENGTH: 786  words


Being mindful of the role of the youth in the development of the country, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif launched six different schemes in September 2013 namely
Youth Business Loans Scheme, Micro Interest free Loan Scheme, Youth Training
Scheme, Youth Skill Development Programme, Scheme for provision of Lap-Tops and
Reimbursement of Fee to students from less developed areas. These schemes were
designed to tackle un-employment among youth and also enhancing their skills and
capability to engage productively in national effort to change the
socio-economic profile of country.

Under the Youth Business Loan Scheme, the PML (N) government committed to
provide loans up to Rs.5 million to the youth ensuring gender equality. The
scheme differed from the previous failed schemes in many respects. Its
implementation was entrusted to National Bank and First Women Bank, who could
take care of all aspects of loans without political interference in line with
the policies chalked out by government, based purely on commercial
considerations. Later most private banks including Sindh Bank, HBL, MCB and
Habib Metropolitan Bank, Soneri bank etc also joined the scheme.

The interest free loan scheme envisaged giving loans of up to Rs.50,000 to
individuals belonging to the poorer and underprivileged sections of society.
Paying fees of students from far-flung and comparatively less developed areas of
the country was meant to facilitate the youth of those areas to pursue their
studies unruffled by the paucity of resources, Youth Skills Development Schemes
envisaged to impart technical training to boys and girls who have studied only
up to eighth level and on the job training for the graduates with monthly
scholarship of Rs.12000. The lap top scheme targeting the deserving students
with good academic records was also a brilliant idea to encourage them to pursue
their studies with more dedication and commitment.

All these schemes have been vigorously pursued by the concerned agencies ever
since their initiation in September 2013. An incisive inquiry regarding their
implementation reveals that under the Youth Business Loan Scheme loans amounting
to Rs.2512.693 million have so far been disbursed among 17861 individuals .To
avoid delays in the processing of loans, balloting has been replaced by the
existing loan processing procedures. Under the fee reimbursement scheme the HEC
has reimbursed fees to 152798 the poor students up to March 2017 since its
inception in 2013.The number of new students registered for the scheme stands at
28592. An amount of Rs 634,983,533 has been released to different universities
for the year 2016-17

Through the interest free loan scheme Rs.6110 million have been given to 272,092
individuals. The number of lap tops distributed among students is 188188.
Reportedly another consignment of 89,499 lap-tops has been delivered to
different universities for distribution among the students. The Scheme is not
being executed in isolation; it is supplemented by other initiatives like Smart
University project; wherein all universities have availability of WiFi
throughout the Campus; Smart Class project wherein students can attend  and
study virtually , and have access to all the information being taught at
classroom; Smart Assessment project, Education TV; HEC Cloud data center, etc.

According to the official sources under the Youth Skill Development Programme
24934 students graduated in the first phase, 20392 in the second phase and in
the third phase 23880 have already completed their training courses while 25252
are still under training. The govt has made available an amount of Rs.4608
million for the three phases. Similarly under Youth Training Scheme 49637 have
been provided internship with different govt departments and entities. This
scheme is for master degree and associate diploma holders who are paid a stipend
of Rs.12,000 during their one year internship.

As is evident all the foregoing initiatives launched by the government have been
pursued with uncompromising commitment and the progress on them so far has been
indeed very encouraging. The youth are the future of the country. Engaging them
in productive pursuits and self-employment avenues is the best insurance against
poverty. and an irrefutable guarantee for economic prosperity. The country can
move forward only when there are greater employment opportunities in the private
sector. Pakistani youth are around 35-40% of the total population and any move
that ensures and guarantees their gainful employment is bound to accelerate the
process of economic progress due to its multiplier effect besides enhancing tax
revenues of the government that this newly initiated economic activity will
generate.

DATELINE: Peshawar


Peshawar, Jan. 19 -- Chief Coordinator of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Marvi Memon said the loan scheme has been extended to FATA for the economic
development and welfare of the area.

She stated this while talking to the officials of National Bank of Pakistan and
tribal elders during her visit to Khyber Agency on Saturday.

Marvi Memon said the Prime Minister desired that the FATA youth should also take
full advantage from the loan scheme. She said the people of FATA are protectors
of Pakistan and all out efforts will be made to address the problems faced by
them.

On January 9, Marvi Memon said in DI Khan that PM business loan scheme would

The main aim of this scheme is to enable unemployed youth to start their own

development of the country.

benefit after obtaining the loans and will use it for welfare of the community.
Before general election 2013, she said Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has
promised with youth that he would take solid measures to resolve the issue of
unemployment.

She said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has fulfilled the promise and now it was
the responsibility of the youth to use this money not only for their benefits
but also in development of Pakistan.

She said condition for availing the loans has been made more easier for
facilitation of youth.

She said an online system has been established for resolution of peoples'
grievances and complaints and all the coordinators of the scheme in Centre and
Provinces have been assigned the task not only to review the complaints but also
take quick actions for its resolution.

Govt Reviews Plan for Youth Fund

BYLINE: Emma Onyango

LENGTH: 567 words

DATELINE: Kampala


Government's move to remove the stringent conditions set on the youth fund has
been met with mixed reactions.

Government in a bid to reduce unemployment amongst the youth set aside Ush.25
billion ($10 million) in the 2011/2012 budget for "Youth Entrepreneurship
Venture Capital Fund", where loans will be given out to those starting new
businesses.

The loan sizes range from Ush.100,000 ($44) to Shs 5 million ($2,170), of which
a 20% injection of equity into youth investment clubs. Enterprise Uganda was
asked to lead the drive in educating the youth about the dynamics of starting
and sustaining businesses.

However, legislators and youth complained that the conditions set to access the
loans were so tight for many ordinary youths to get the money meant to help in
job creation and reducing unemployment.

They sighted conditions like having a certificate in entrepreneurship training
and O' level would make many youths miss benefiting from the fund.

Appearing before the Parliament's committee on gender, labour and social
development last week, Maria Kiwanuka, the Finance Minister said government had
revisited some of the stringent conditions to enable all intended beneficiaries
access the funds.

The minister said they had scrapped off the condition that requires
beneficiaries to present their O' level certificates of education before
accessing the money.

She also added that the ministry was in consultations with the banks responsible
for handling the loans to consider giving out loans of up to Ush.10 million
($4,340) to a group of two people rather than the five.

Some of the youth who spoke to the East African Business Week expressed their
appreciation to the government for removing the stringent conditions.

"We always met challenges when applying for this loan because the conditions
were so tight that it was only a certain class of people who could access them.
I believe with the conditions relaxed we are definitely getting this loan", one
of them said.

Charles Ocici, the Executive Director, Enterprise Uganda however warns that
softening the conditions does not mean that the youth will ultimately benefit
from the funds.

"It is welcome news that the conditions have been revised but then it wouldn't
make sense if you just sent them the money. Support them with attitude
transformation and skills. In the private sector, there are seasoned businessmen
with no loans at all and these are the people these youth will compete against.

"To me, I would maintain the requirement that one goes through financial
training not as a precondition to attaining the loan, but out of choice because
that is the most important aspect in the private sector", says Ocici.

He also adds that because the conditions have been softened, banks that are
tasked with handling the loans are going to put more emphasis on the guarantor.
This he says may pose a great danger to the guarantor should one fail to pay the
money.

"The banks will need to get back the loans which will have to be refunded by the
successful business enterprises (if one is set up in any case) which means that
that enterprise must be able to compete effectively in the private sector. If
they fail, then the other way for the bank to recover that money is through the
guarantor."

He adds, "Whoever will be guaranteeing these easily accessible funds should
therefore do his/her homework otherwise many people may end up in Luzira
(Prison)."

Nawaz unveils Rs 20bln youth uplift package

SECTION: Vol. XXXVII No. 262

LENGTH: 999  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday announced a development package worth
Rs20 billion for the country's youth comprising six projects, aimed at providing
them assistance mainly through affordable education, soft loans and skill-based
training.

The six projects include Micro Interest Free Loans Scheme, Small Business Loans
Scheme, Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme, Fee Assistance
Scheme and PM's Scheme for Laptops Provision, said Nawaz Sharif in his second
televised address to the nation.

He said the government was committed to the uplift of youth. "I am sure that a
self-reliant and prosperous youth will prove as a vanguard in the nation's
journey towards national integrity, prosperity and sovereignty."

The premier announced that the six development schemes would be applicable for
the youth of the four provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.

The federal cabinet had approved the basic features of these programmes on
September 13 and the system for their implementation was also in place.

Sharif said, however, to ensure more transparency, clarity and merit in these
schemes, it was his desire to seek guidance from general public.

He said input on these schemes could be given at the website, www.pmo.gov.pk,
being uploaded on September 23.

A special mobile phone number '80028' had also been dedicated for this purpose
to which suggestions could be sent through SMS.

The prime minister said the details of these schemes would also be circulated
through national media including newspapers and television channels.

Nawaz Sharif said the general public was welcome to send their written proposals
addressed to the Prime Minister's Office in Islamabad as well. He said 10-days
had been allocated for collection of suggestions and recommendations, and added
he would not be satisfied until receiving an ample response from youth on the
schemes meant for their prosperity.

The schemes would be launched soon after working on the proposals and giving
them a final shape.

He said Rs20 billion allocated for the schemes for youth was not a big amount;
however the limitation of resources owed to the severe economic problems of the
country.

The issues including electricity shortage, the projects about construction of
roads, motorways, hospitals and setting up of industrial units needed large
monetary resources.

He expressed hope that a time would come when the tax payers' money would be
largely spent on the welfare projects and vowed to allocate more funds for the
schemes of public importance in coming years.

About the first scheme, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the 'Micro Interest
Free Loans' is especially focused upon the financially weak segments of the
society.

Under this scheme, a total of Rs3.5 billion would be earmarked in the current
financial year, which would benefit about 250,000 people. No interest would be
charged on these loans.

He also announced 'Small Business Loan Scheme' exclusively for the educated
youth willing to initiate their private businesses.

The prime minister said 50 per cent loans would be specified for the women.
Under this scheme, skilled individuals would get loans worth Rs0.5 million to
Rs2 million each to help start their work in agriculture sector or to open
workshops.

"The markup rate on this loan would be 8 per cent as the remaining would be
borne by the government. Initially, the National Bank of Pakistan and First
Women Bank will extend this loan," said the premier, adding that the government
had allocated Rs5 billion for the scheme.

The third initiative, he said was 'Youth Training Scheme' under which the youth
having completed 16-year education from accredited educational institutes would
be provided training so that they may find suitable job opportunities locally or
abroad.

He also prayed that every citizen may get job opportunity in the country without
going abroad.

Prime Minister Sharif said during the on-job-training, the youth will be paid
Rs10,000 stipend monthly for one year and Rs4 billion have been allocated for
the scheme that would benefit around 50,000 graduates.

Under the 'Youth Skill Development Scheme,' he said youngsters would be trained
to help them earn their livelihood respectfully. The youth aged up to 25 years
and with education up to eighth grade would be entitled to avail this facility.

The premier then went on to elaborate the six schemes briefly.

1. The micro-interest free loan scheme is targeted at disadvantaged sections of
the society and will benefit two hundred and fifty thousand people. An
allocation of Rs3.5 billion has been made during the current financial year.

2. The second scheme is for small business loans for those youth who were
educated and/or skilled and wished to become entrepreneurs in their industry.
Five billion rupees have been allocated for the scheme, which will give out
loans ranging from Rs 0.5-2 million.

3. The youth training scheme will provide training for entry into the job market
to an estimated 50, 000 potential graduates who have completed 16 years or more
of education. This scheme has Rs4 billion earmarked for it.

4. The youth skilled development scheme will provide technical and vocational
training to students who have passed the eighth grade. They will be given six
months of training in different trades along with a scholarship of Rs5,000 a
month.

5. Under another scheme, the government plans to sponsor the tuition fees for
the higher studies of financially deprived students. The government will pay at
an average, forty thousand rupees of annual fees on behalf of each of the 30,000
students for MA, MSc and higher level education. This scheme is being launched
at a cost of Rs1.2 billion.

6. Another scheme was launched for the provision of laptops to 100,000 students.
This will incur a cost of Rs4 billion rupees.

The Prime Minister said the Federal Cabinet had already approved basic structure
of these schemes, but they were open to more suggestions on making these schemes
more transparent and just. News agencies

Youths Urged to Repay Loans

BYLINE: Lucas Barasa

LENGTH: 368  words

DATELINE: Nairobi


The Kenya Government has called on beneficiaries of the Youth Fund to honour
their agreement and repay the money.

Assistant minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Wavinya Ndeti said noble ideas
like the Youth Fund should not be abused.

"We are encouraging the youth to continue servicing their loans even with the
little returns they get in their business activities, we are well aware of the
challenges that come with running a business and we have been very supportive to
all that have come for loans, in that we give financial advice over and above
the grants...," she said.

"We have about 10 youth groups that have visited the youth affairs office
seeking advice after facing great challenges midway. We urge all the
beneficiaries to exercise discipline and honesty in their business practices."

The money loaned to the youths is channelled through the Youth Enterprise
Development Fund.

She, however, admitted that it is challenging to have a 100 percent success
story on such a big first-time venture.

"However we have a number of success stories too."

She said it is in the spirit of encouraging the debt defaulters to repay that
"we have brought on board various local leaders to assist with the project per
project field visits at the grass root level with a view to establishing the
difficulties being faced and we will in turn come up with a wholesome solution
to the loan servicing challenge currently being faced".

She said the government appreciates those who have been faithful in paying back
the loans.

On Thursday, the Nation reported that youth and women groups have started
defaulting on loans given to start businesses.

The default rate is at about 40 per cent and managers fear that the revolving
funds could dry out soon and deny opportunities to new borrowers.

Managers of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund and Women Enterprise Fund say
some borrowers had stopped servicing their loans.

The Youth Enterprise Development Fund has allocated Sh2.5 billion to about 8500
youth and 71,000 individual enterprises since 2007.

Statistics from the Ministry of Gender indicates that only about Sh71 million of
the Sh265 million advanced to women groups since 2007 through the Enterprise
Fund had been repaid.

Country can progress tremendously by harnessing youth talent: PM

SECTION: Vol. 13 No. 04

LENGTH: 1027  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on  Friday said the country could achieve
tremendous development by  harnessing the youth's talent and energy, who formed
60 percent of the population.

Speaking at the launching ceremony of Youth Business Scheme here at Hyderabad
Club, he said the government had decided to empower  the youth economically by
granting loans to help them launch their own businesses.

This would not only help improve the socio-economic condition of the youth, but
also directly benefit their family members, and other stakeholders engaged in
different business activities, he added.

A total of 40 applicants, including 18 women, whose loan applications fulfilling
codal formalities were accepted also attended the function and replied to the
queries of Prime Minister.

Nawaz Sharif said the government had launched the scheme to improve the economic
condition of the youth, who would be given loans ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 2
million.

The government realised that the country's educated and uneducated youth  had no
access to financial opportunities for their economic empowerment.

No development could be achieved without active participation of the youth, he
said and added the government had decided to make the future builders
financially strong.

He said youth were the major contributors to the development of any country and
the government was determined to open vistas for them,  who remained neglected
so far.

In the past, big loans, amounting upto Rs 20 billion were being granted to
individuals or groups, but the youth were ignored, he said.

The Prime Minister said the present government was determined to remove the
sense of deprivation among the youth by supporting them. Nawaz Sharif said a
transparent policy had been formed for granting loans to the deserving youth
purely on merit and no pressure would be tolerated.

Even he himself could not assert pressure on the  authorities concerned in
giving loans, he said and added only those would avail the facility who had
comprehensive plans to start their business.

The Prime Minister said the scheme was actually conceived during his last
tenure, but it could not be launched due to unavoidable circumstances. He said
he had never forgotten the scheme and committed to the youth during his recent
election campaign.  Now, the youth would soon reap its benefits.

The scheme would bring a great change in the socio- economic conditions of the
people in about a year. It would not only gear up economic activities, but also
help improve the gross domestic product, he added.

He criticised those who were trying to mislead the youth by making propaganda
against the scheme. He called upon the youth not to pay any heed to them and
work for the country's progress and prosperity by availing the opportunity.

Recalling the Yellow Cab Scheme launched during his second tenure, the Prime
Minister said it proved very successful as 99 percent recovery rate had been
achieved.

He expressed the hope that after getting loan, the youth would work hard to
promote their businesses and return their liabilities within scheduled time.

The Prime Minister said the youth through their hard work would help government
launch development projects in every nook and corner of the country.

He said the government had decided to launch Karachi Circular Railways and he
had already chaired a meeting in this regard.

He said the government was determined to serve the masses without discrimination
and was making decisions purely on merit. The time was not far when the people
would enjoy the fruit of his efforts.

He said Sindh had played a great role after the creation of Pakistan as it
welcomed all those wholeheartedly, who came here after migration from other
parts of the Sub-continent.

The Prime Minister said under Youth Business Scheme, the youth would have to
repay the loan within eight years and no recovery would be made during the first
year. Realizing the difficulties of the youth in getting guarantors, he said the
government had made some relaxation in that respect. The applicants could now
name their relatives as guarantors. They could also furnish the guarantee of
government officers of Grade-15 or above.

The applicants could also produce the guarantee of more than one person and even
they could get loan against moveable and immoveable property worth 1.5 (one
point five) times more than the required amount, he said.

He said the condition of having bank account with National Bank of Pakistan had
also been relaxed and now those having accounts with other banks could also
apply.

Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said the loan application scrutiny process was being
monitored strictly, and if any injustice was done to the applicants action would
be taken against the bank officers concerned.

President, National Bank of Pakistan, Munir Kamal said that through Youth
Business Scheme, the banking sector access would be improved. The banking sector
access in Pakistan was very little as compared to other countries.

He said that under directives of the Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Prime
Minister's Youth Development Programme, Maryam Nawaz, a transparent policy had
been framed for granting loan.

Later, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held direct interaction with the applicants,
who were selected for grant of loan after completion of required formalities.
Among the applicants, Naima Husain from Thatta, Saba Khalid from Hyderabad,
Rahila Ammad from Thatta, Gulshan from Sinjhoro district Sanghar, Osama from
Latifabad Hyderabad, Junaid Saleem from Dadu, Khurram Memon from Hala and Ramesh
Kumar from Tando Muhammad Khan briefed the Prime Minister about their business
plans.

Among others, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Federal Minister for
Information and Broadcasting Senator Pervaiz Rashid, Ameer Bakhsh Bhutto,
Minister of State for Railways Abdul Hakeem Baloch, Advisor to the Prime
Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh, Imdad Bhutto, MPA Haji Shafi Muhammad Jamote, MPA
Irfan Ullah Khan Marwat, General Secretary , Pakistan Muslim League-Sindh,
Saleem Zia, Syed Aijaz Shah Sheerazi, Shah Muhammad Shah and Chief Coordinator
Youth Business Scheme Sindh, MNA Ms. Marvi Memon were also present.

Youth Fund Viewed As Free Government Money

BYLINE: Victor Makanda

LENGTH: 936 words


Reports released last week concerning financial institution Cabs suspending its
US$10million Kurera/Ukondla Youth Fund did not come as a surprise to many.

The financial institution is reported to have taken this decision following the
very high rate of non-performing loans (NPL) which stood at 78%.

According to its senior management, who gave an update before a parliamentary
portfolio committee on Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment, Cabs had
disbursed nearly US$4,9million with NPLs amounting to US$3,7million.

Following these disappointing developments, the building society received
instructions in May from trustees of the fund to stop processing applications
for the subsequent disbursing of loans while they formulate an alternative
strategy for the fund.

Although supporting the noble cause of youth empowerment, the decision to
suspend the fund was long overdue as over 70% of the loans disbursed in the past
four years have not been repaid. The Youth Fund is run under the Ministry of
Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment and administered essentially by
three institutions; Cabs, CBZ and IDBZ. With the nature of these funds being
revolving and the high NPLs prevalent, other institutions, CBZ and IDBZ, may
possibly follow suit unless a change in strategy is formulated and implemented.

At this time when Cabs has made such a decision, it may be a good time to assess
the harsh realities concerning national youth funds. Do such programmes normally
succeed or they are just used for gaining political mileage?

What could have been the reasons for such a huge NPL ratio and are there
possible solutions? Are there other possible ways in which youths can be
assisted or should youth funds be abandoned?

Research done on youth funds in other African countries by the International
Labour Organisation and some developmental institutions show that the ways the
fund is crafted and administered have a huge bearing on its ultimate success.

Worth mentioning from the onset is the fact that loan repayments have always
been a major challenge in most nations where such exercises have been carried
out. Loan repayments in most nations have been low not because of inability to
pay.

Rather, most youths are just reluctant to repay these funds as they are viewed
as "free government money." Thus the behavior by local youths in non-repayment
of loans is in sync with peer nations. Regardless of the high risk of
non-repayment when dishing out such loans, the loan origination and evaluation
processes to a greater extent determine the success or failure of most youth
funds.

Decision makers who craft and pursue stringent measures and thorough diligence
in giving out loans are most likely to succeed compared to those who pursue lax
policies.

In as much as Zimbabwe is trapped in a liquidity crunch, the 78% NPL ratio as
revealed by Cabs leaves a lot to be desired. It highlights the hidden truth that
the process possibly was not implemented in a thorough manner.

This also cements alleged reports that some youths were using the funds for
vehicle purchases and others for paying the bride price to their in-laws.

In addition, reports alleging that there was mismanagement of funds within the
ministry could have been another factor in the high NPL ratio. With Cabs among
the few institutions with low default rates in their commercial loans, one is
also forced to conclude that had they been allowed to decide who gets the money,
the ratio could have been lower.

The view of Cabs for the formulation of an alternative strategy also points to a
situation where management too came to the realization of diversion of funds
from the intended core purpose. Such a high NPLs ratio further strengthens the
position of banks that have always been reluctant to offer loans to this group
as they regard them as "unreliable."

Going forward, key pillars must be put in place so that such programs can become
effective. Their success is measured by growth in the revolving funds which
entails relatively low non repayment rates and a high number of jobs created
(especially their quality) among other benchmarks. In light of this, proper
assessment of business plans is critical.

Reducing the diversion of funds is very critical and this can be achieved by
giving out loans to already established companies with existing track records
rather than the current method which relies on successful business plans.

This is so because nowadays with a few dollars one can produce a "feasible"
business plan even though one is not a true entrepreneur.

Furthermore, alternative ways in giving out loans such as paying suppliers
rather than handing it over to youths can possibly produce better results.Other
nations assume joint ownership of the assets acquired through youth funds.

Cabs and the respective ministry may need to consider such measures as they may
reduce abuse of such funds thereby resulting in growth of revolving funds.

Other factors or areas such as developing entrepreneurial skills within youths
through training also need attention as a way of ensuring successful schemes.

Lessons can be learnt from developed nations where entrepreneurship is supported
strongly by policymakers.

Other nations have done this by even reducing the red tape associated with
setting up and running new businesses.

Startups in other countries are funded by friends and family and angel
investors. Such channels may also need to be considered by youths rather than
rushing to national funds.

Overall, a cleansing ceremony may be required within the economy as honoring
loan obligations is proving to be difficult starting from the top.

Pakistan: PM's loan scheme to bring unemployment graph down: speakers

LENGTH: 507  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Dec. 13 -- PRIME Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme has received
encouraging response from the unemployed youth but if the scheme would be
launched with the consultation of various institutions, more people could
benefit from it and the chances of loan defaults reduced.

These views were expressed by the speakers in Jang Economic Session on 'Prime
Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme - Benefits - Concerns', here on Wednesday.
The panellists were Raja Hasnain Javed, Shabhia Zehra, Khalid Niaz, Yawar Irfan,
Tayyaba Tahir, Amir Mukhtar and Abida Shahmim while hosted by Sikandar Hameed
Lodhi.

Raja Hasnain Javed said the prime minister loan scheme was the right step
towards youth future and it was launched with easy conditions, which would be
helpful for youth to start their own business and create employment. He said, in
the past, such schemes were used for political purposes but this time government
had evolved infrastructure for it, which would help reduce unemployment in the
country.

Shabhia Zehra said the loan scheme would help the educated youth to explore new
businesses in their respective areas, which would increase country's
productivity. She believed majority of the people in our society were parasite,
who did not want to do work. She said common perception in the public was that
the loan money would not be returned as it happened in the past. She said with
this loan anyone could earn at least 8 percent profit.

Khalid Niaz said, in the past, such schemes were launched to achieve political
objectives. He said prime minister loan scheme was a good step towards the right
direction and if it would be implemented according to devised conditions, the
desired results could be achieved from it. He said small and medium enterprises
should be the priorities in the scheme, while seven million applications were
received so far, which showed its popularity among youth.

Yawar Irfan said it should be ensured that loan would be disbursed among the
educated, technically skilled and trained people. He believed quota allocated
for home-based women was a ray of hope for the cottage industry and it would be
helpful in its growth. He doubted that despite the condition of a guarantor,
loan default could be possible for which a comprehensive mechanism should be
evolved for loan returns to protect bank money.

Tayyaba Tahir said apparently the loan scheme was attractive for youth. She said
women could improve their living standard by utilising the loan money. She said
a number of jobs would be created with this loan scheme which would improve GDP
growth.

Amir Mukhtar said youth feared the scheme could not be for a specific group,
likewise in the past. He said that loan scheme should not be used for political
purpose and it should be transparent. Abida Shamim stressed the need for
transparent distribution of loans

Go for Loans, MP Tells Youth

BYLINE: Raphael Mwadime

LENGTH: 296  words


Youth in Taita district have not collected millions of shillings from the
national youth kitty allocated to them by the government in this financial year.
According to the CEO of the Youth Enterprise Fund Juma Mwatata, Sh7 million is
lying at the bank uncollected since local youth have failed to apply for loans.

Wundanyi MP Thomas Mwadeghu who was present during the function where seven
groups were awarded sh 50,000 loans and three individuals awarded sh 25,000
loans each, expressed his displeasure to the youth who lament lack of
unemployment by the government. Mwadeghu called on the youth to stop being
dependent on white-collar jobs and instead come out to seek loans to empower
themselves economically. "At a time like this when there are no opportunities in
the white-collar job industry, small-scale enterprises are the best and its
worrying to see only few groups take advantage of the youth kitty," he said.

Statistics at the local youth office show that very few youth groups had applied
for the loans in the district despite the overwhelming rate of unemployment
facing the youth in the region. "The youth should come out of their comfort
zones and work hard. It so sad that despite the rising population of jobless
youth in the region, only a few groups and people apply for loans.You have to
change your attitudes and begin taking risks to empower yourselves
economically," said the law-maker. "Some of you are qualified in fields like
economics, accounts, marketing, business administration but you don't take any
initiative to apply your skills in improving your livelihoods through this
fund,"he said. Mwadeghu challenged the youths to stop shying away from the fund
and take positive risks which can turn their lives around and end the poverty in
the region.

Youth programmes - Am engine of socio-economic change

BYLINE: Nauman Ashraf

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 957

LENGTH: 1079  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Shrif presided over the second computerized balloting for
grant of 6000 loans to the youth including women, under Prime Minister's Youth
Business loans Scheme on Wednesday.

The first balloting held recently also disbursed loans to the same number of men
and women. The Youth Business Loan Schemeinitiative differs from the previous
failed schemes in many respects.

It is being implemented through commercial banks who can take care of all
aspects of the loans without political interference in line with the policies
chalked out by the government. Another aspect is the commitment of the
government to ensure utmost transparency in advancing these loans to make sure
that the loans are given only to the really deserving individuals.

The third salient feature of the scheme is the element of gender equality
proposed for these loans. These loans will range between five hundred thousand
to two million; fair enough for starting a personal business.

This would provide excellent opportunities to skilled, qualified and
professional youth of both genders to explore and set up avenues of
self-employment in a dignified manner and add to the prosperity of their
respective families. As is evident the package of the youth programmes is an
engine of socio-economic change in the country.

The Prime Minister had announced the launch of six different schemes in
September 2013 namely Small Business Loans Scheme, Micro Interest free Scheme,
Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme, Fee Assistance Scheme and
PM Scheme for Lap Tops. Theinterest-free loan scheme for the youth announced on
13thMay will benefit one million individuals costing Rs.3.5 billion to the
exchequer. The scheme envisaging disbursement of loans up to Rs.50,000 through
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund will cover the entire countryespecially rural
and far flung areas with 50% share going to young women. The Prime Minister
during his election campaign had promised to launch schemes for the youth aimed
at helping them start their own businesses and building their capacities for
self-employment.

The launch of the interest free loan scheme alsorepresents another step towards
the fulfillment of the pledge which constitutes a significant initiative to
changethe economic situations of the youth besides triggering a process of
sustained socio-economic development in the country.

The scheme targeted at the poorer andunderprivileged sections of the society is
a very humane gesture on the part of the Prime Minister which indicates his
concern and sympathy for the down-trodden masses.

Similarly Fee Assistance Scheme for students from the far-flung and
comparatively less developed areas of the country will also not only facilitate
the youth of those areas to pursue higher studies unruffled by the paucity of
resources but would also be a tremendous help to their families as well.

The Youth Skills Development Scheme that envisages to impart technical training
to boys and girls who have studied only up to eighth level and on the job
training for the graduates with monthly scholarship of Rs.10000 are also prudent
policy initiatives. The PM lap top scheme targeting the deserving students with
good academic records is also a brilliant idea to encourage them to pursue their
studies with more dedication and commitment.

The status of the youth of a nation as architects of its future progress and
prosperity, has an unqualified universal recognition in the modern era and that
is why the nations all over the world focus considerable attention on harnessing
the potential of their young generations-their human capital---through education
and imparting of skills to ensure their productive absorption in the workforce
as well as the creation of opportunities for their self-employment to accelerate
socio-economic development of the country.

In most of the developing and poor countries, lack of education, finances and
technological skills are the biggest hindrances in their gainful employment in
whatever opportunities are available in the job-market. Thus the growing
un-employment among the youth not only affects the economic progress of that
country but also unleashes disastrous consequence for the society in the shape
of lawlessness and crimes.

The idea of targeting the youth from the less privileged classes gained currency
during the early fifties , became a wide spread phenomenon in the eighties and
now forms an integral part of any growth model evolved in the third world
countries.

The strategy adopted was to provide micro-credit to the youth for setting up
their own business, small industries, improving their technological skills for
enhancing their chances of employability or pursing their higher education. This
is regarded as a very vital ingredient of a sustained economic growth.
Bangladesh and Nepal in our region who adopted this growth model are far ahead
of us at the moment though they were far behind us to start with.

Viewed in the backdrop of the foregoing the package for the youth announced by
the PML (N) government, is an imaginative move to tackle un-employment among
youth and also enhancing their skills and capability to engage productively in
the national effort to change the socio-economic profile of the country.

Though Rs.100 billion allocated for the purpose may look pea-nuts to some in
view of the snow-balling unemployment among the youth but it still is a very
substantial leap in the right direction.

Economic recovery permitting and more resources becoming available with the
government, these allocations are surely to be enhanced and the scheme will be
made a permanent feature of the national economic strategy, as the Prime
Minister has promised. As they say it is the first step in the right direction
that really matters. The process becomes self-sustained once it is nudged on to
the right path.

The country can move forward only when there are greater employment
opportunities in the private sector. Pakistan government at present employs only
7% of the work force and with more and more people joining the labour market,
the private sector has to play a wider and more expansive role in this area.
Pakistani youth are around 35-40% of the total population and any move that
ensures and guarantees their gainful employment is bound to accelerate the
process of economic progress due to its multiplier effect besides enhancing tax
revenues of the government that this newly initiated economic activity will
generate.

The prime minister announced that the six development schemes would benefit the
youth of four provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Nawaz said that to
ensure more transparency, clarity and merit in these schemes, it was his desire
to seek guidance from the general public.

He said input on these schemes could be given at the website www.pmo.gov.pk,
which will be uploaded tomorrow (Monday), and through SMS on special mobile
number 80028. About the first scheme, Prime Minister Nawaz said the Micro
Interest-Free Loans is especially focussed on the financially weak segments of
society. Under this scheme, a total of Rs 3.5 billion would be earmarked in the
current financial year, which would benefit about 250,000 people. No interest
would be charged on these loans. He also announced Small Business Loan Scheme
exclusively for the educated youth willing to start their private businesses.

The prime minister said 50 percent loans would be specified for the women. Under
this scheme, skilled individuals would get loans worth Rs 0.5 million to Rs 2
million to help start their work in agriculture sector or to open a workshop.
"The markup rate on this loan would be 8 percent," the prime minister said,
adding that the government had allocated Rs 5 billion for the scheme.

The third initiative, Nawaz said, was Youth Training Scheme under which the
youth having completed 16-year education from accredited educational institutes
would be provided training so that they may find suitable jobs locally or
abroad. The prime minister said that during the on-job training, the youth would
be paid Rs 10,000 stipend monthly for one year, and Rs 4 billion have been
allocated for the scheme, which would benefit around 50,000 graduates.

Under the Youth Skill Development Scheme, he said youngsters would be trained to
help them earn their livelihood respectfully. The youth aged up to 25 years and
with education up to eighth grade would be entitled to avail this facility.
"These youths will be trained for six months and will be paid Rs 5,000 monthly
as stipend," he said, adding Rs 800 million have been specified for the purpose.
The fifth scheme is about providing assistance to youth of underdeveloped areas
for their tuition fees. The government would pay for the tuition fees of all
such deserving students at masters level and above. For this purpose, an amount
of Rs 1.2 billion has been allocated which would cover the expenses of some
30,000 students. Under the Prime Minister's Scheme for Provision of Laptops, one
million students would be given laptops with an amount of Rs 4 billion reserved
for the project.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday announced a development package worth Rs

The package comprises six projects, which are aimed at providing them

training. The six projects are: Micro Interest-Free Loans Scheme, Small Business
Loans Scheme, Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme, Fee
Assistance Scheme and PM's Scheme for Laptops Provision, said Nawaz Sharif in

Pakistan: PM's loan scheme to bring unemployment graph down: speakers

LENGTH: 514  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Dec. 13 -- PRIME Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme has received
encouraging response from the unemployed youth but if the scheme would be
launched with the consultation of various institutions, more people could
benefit from it and the chances of loan defaults reduced.

These views were expressed by the speakers in Jang Economic Session on 'Prime
Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme - Benefits - Concerns', here on Wednesday.

The panellists were Raja Hasnain Javed, Shabhia Zehra, Khalid Niaz, Yawar Irfan,
Tayyaba Tahir, Amir Mukhtar and Abida Shahmim while hosted by Sikandar Hameed
Lodhi.

Raja Hasnain Javed said the prime minister loan scheme was the right step
towards youth future and it was launched with easy conditions, which would be
helpful for youth to start their own business and create employment.

Raja Hasnain Javed said, in the past, such schemes were used for political
purposes but this time government had evolved infrastructure for it, which would
help reduce unemployment in the country.

Shabhia Zehra said the loan scheme would help the educated youth to explore new
businesses in their respective areas, which would increase country's
productivity.

She believed majority of the people in our society were parasite, who did not
want to do work.

Shabhia Zehra said common perception in the public was that the loan money would
not be returned as it happened in the past. She said with this loan anyone could
earn at least 8 percent profit.

Khalid Niaz said, in the past, such schemes were launched to achieve political
objectives. He said prime minister loan scheme was a good step towards the right
direction and if it would be implemented according to devised conditions, the
desired results could be achieved from it.

He said small and medium enterprises should be the priorities in the scheme,
while seven million applications were received so far, which showed its
popularity among youth.

Yawar Irfan said it should be ensured that loan would be disbursed among the
educated, technically skilled and trained people.

Yawar Irfan believed quota allocated for home-based women was a ray of hope for
the cottage industry and it would be helpful in its growth. He doubted that
despite the condition of a guarantor, loan default could be possible for which a
comprehensive mechanism should be evolved for loan returns to protect bank
money.

Tayyaba Tahir said apparently the loan scheme was attractive for youth. She said
women could improve their living standard by utilising the loan money. Tayyaba
Tahir said a number of jobs would be created with this loan scheme which would
improve GDP growth.

Amir Mukhtar said youth feared the scheme could not be for a specific group,
likewise in the past. He said that loan scheme should not be used for political
purpose and it should be transparent. Abida Shamim stressed the need for
transparent distribution of loans

Nyeri groups top borrowers from youth fund

BYLINE: MARY WAMBUI

LENGTH: 497  words


Most of the cash borrowed by the youth was used to start or grow agribusinesses.


Youth from five counties in central Kenya have borrowed more than Sh271 million
from the Youth Fund in the last four months.
Most of the cash borrowed by young people from Murang'a, Nyandarua, Nyeri,
Kirinyaga and Laikipia was used to start or grow agribusinesses.


According to Central Region Youth Enterprise Development Fund coordinator Samuel
Njue youth groups from Nyeri County are the highest borrowers from the Youth
Enterprise Development Fund in central region.
So far, youth groups in the region have borrowed over Sh57 million in the
current financial year's status report dated October 31, 2015.
Murang'a (Sh47m), Nyandarua (Sh44m) and Kirinyaga (Sh42m) counties are second,
third and fourth respectively while Laikipia County (Sh16m) closes the list.
Most of the young people in these regions engage in agricultural activities in
groups in lands donated to them by their parents.
Records show that Nyeri youth mostly borrow individual loans, dubbed Vuka, and
sector specific loans.
The Vuka loans are given to individuals to engage in start-ups or those wanting
to expand their businesses while sector specific loans are disbursed as farm
implements where the youth receive greenhouses and incubators as individuals or
groups.
BUY BUSINESS ASSETS
Central Region Youth Funds coordinator Samuel Njue said that in Nyeri alone,
over 20 youth have so far used the loans to buy assets and engage in business
activities and other income generating ventures.
"During the period between 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 financial years, youth in the
county took over Sh15 million Vuka loans which they used and are paying back in
a commendable way," said Mr Njue.
Majority of these youth hailed from Nyeri Town and Othaya constituencies, the
two regions leading in the uptake of loans in the county.
The sector-specific loans do not involve cash but farm implements to help them
engage in their chosen farming projects.
"We partner with agriculture firms like Amiran and Smart Solutions Africa to
provide the youth with all the implements they need to engage in commercial
agriculture at subsidised costs after which we allow them a grace period of four
months before they start paying us the value of the implements loaned to them
interest-free," said Mr Njue.
However, Mr Njue noted that the rate of borrowing in Mukurwe-ini Constituency
has been very low.
"So far we have only disbursed only Sh5.3 million in the constituency to groups
and none to individuals.

"There seems to be a societal problem that should be addressed," Mr Njue said.

12 youth fund loan defaulters to face music

SECTION: National; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 417 words


TWELVE young entrepreneurs in Selangor who have failed to service the
loans they took from the State Youth Economic Fund will be taken to court
starting next month.

Another eight who have also failed to pay back their loans have had
their cases referred to the Attorney-General's Chambers by the State Youth
and Sports Department for possible court action.

State Youth, Sports and Tourism chairman Datuk Abdul Fatah Iskandar said
the department had decided to take a tough stand against those who
conveniently "forget" to service or pay back their loans when their
businesses were doing well.

Prior to taking such action, the department had issued several warning
letters and given the entrepreneurs concerned enough notices reminding
them about the possible consequences if they failed to repay their loan.

"However, since they are stubborn, the department has no other recourse
but to take court action against them to recover the outstanding loans,"
he said when replying to a question by Mohamed Pauzi Abdul Murad (BN-
Sungai Panjang).

He said the loan scheme was set up to help enterprising youths set up
business. Once successful they should make an effort to repay their loans
so that other aspiring entrepreneurs could enjoy the same benefit.

He said that to date, loans amounting to RM3.2 million to finance 184
projects had been approved under the scheme, including loans totalling
RM548,000 for 22 projects approved this year.

Another 34 applications for loans totalling RM2.6 million are still
pending.

Apart from providing loans, the department also conducts courses on
entrepreneurship and business opportunities for youths, including those in
the rural areas, who are keen on such ventures.

He said special entrepreneurship courses were also held with the co-
operation of several institutes of higher learning and big organisations
in the country.

State Rural Development, Fishery and Agriculture chairman Datuk Zainal
Dahlan who later answered a question on behalf of Abdul Fatah, said a
business venture which manufactured sports clothing under the brand name
"Sidek" was financed by a State-owned company.

Responding to a supplementary question by Datuk Saidin Tamby (BN-Paya
Jaras), he said the company's business venture was not financed by loans
from the State Youth Economic Fund under the administration of the State
Youth and Sports Department.

"However, the company has since closed down because of poor management."

Gulu Youths Want Government to Relax Loan Scheme Conditions

BYLINE: Jacky Adure

LENGTH: 335 words


Youths in Gulu District have protested what they describe as unfriendly and
tough requirements the government has attached to the youth loan scheme.

The youths, in a three-paged petition to the Acholi Parliamentary Group and the
minister in-charge of the youths, said although the Shs25 billion loan scheme is
a good initiative to help the youth out of poverty, its requirements are
unfriendly and need revision.

The group particularly singled out the basic requirement of at least an O-Level
certificate for a youth to access the loan, calling it a hindrance as majority
of them did not reach Senior Four due to the two-decade Lords Resistance Army
war, among other reasons.

"A large percentage of our youths don't have O-Level certificates but are
business oriented. Leaving them out of the scheme would be unfair," reads part
of the February 15 letter.

The group's leader, Mr Samuel Oyet, said considering the long insurgency in
Northern Uganda, most youths were forced to drop out of school at a tender age.

"Let government revise the requirements that do not cater for the interests of
the youths on recovery process to ensure that all youths in the country benefit
from the scheme," Mr Oyet added.

Meanwhile, the Gulu Youth Officer, Mr Michael Oyat, also said some of the
requirements are unrealistic to realise the required reconstruction of the
region, adding that "those requirements will leave out a bigger percentage of
youths in rural areas who urgently need loans."

Statistics from the district's planning unit indicate that Gulu has about
150,000 youths, three quarters of them are semi-illiterates and live below the
poverty line.

In February this year, the Finance Minister, Ms Maria Kiwanuka, allocated Shs25
billion to three banks-- Stanbic, DFCU and Centenary Bank-- for the youth loan
scheme as a response to check the soaring unemployment problem in the country.

Other requirements for the loan scheme include, age bracket of between 18 and 35
years and having a registered company with formal business.

should be Pakistani[#x201a] holder of valid Computerized National Identity Card
(CNIC) and should have a guarantor.

other details of the Youth Business Loans.
The chairperson said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the loans.

PM's loan scheme to bring unemployment graph down: speakers

LENGTH: 477  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


PRIME Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme has received encouraging response from
the unemployed youth but if the scheme would be launched with the consultation
of various institutions, more people could benefit from it and the chances of
loan defaults reduced.



These views were expressed by the speakers in Jang Economic Session on 'Prime
Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme - Benefits - Concerns', here on Wednesday.

The panellists were Raja Hasnain Javed, Shabhia Zehra, Khalid Niaz, Yawar Irfan,
Tayyaba Tahir, Amir Mukhtar and Abida Shahmim while hosted by Sikandar Hameed
Lodhi.

Raja Hasnain Javed said the prime minister loan scheme was the right step
towards youth future and it was launched with easy conditions, which would be
helpful for youth to start their own business and create employment.

Raja Hasnain Javed said, in the past, such schemes were used for political
purposes but this time government had evolved infrastructure for it, which would
help reduce unemployment in the country.

Shabhia Zehra said the loan scheme would help the educated youth to explore new
businesses in their respective areas, which would increase country's
productivity.

She believed majority of the people in our society were parasite, who did not
want to do work.

Shabhia Zehra said common perception in the public was that the loan money would
not be returned as it happened in the past. She said with this loan anyone could
earn at least 8 percent profit.

Khalid Niaz said, in the past, such schemes were launched to achieve political
objectives. He said prime minister loan scheme was a good step towards the right
direction and if it would be implemented according to devised conditions, the
desired results could be achieved from it.

He said small and medium enterprises should be the priorities in the scheme,
while seven million applications were received so far, which showed its
popularity among youth.

Yawar Irfan said it should be ensured that loan would be disbursed among the
educated, technically skilled and trained people.

Yawar Irfan believed quota allocated for home-based women was a ray of hope for
the cottage industry and it would be helpful in its growth. He doubted that
despite the condition of a guarantor, loan default could be possible for which a
comprehensive mechanism should be evolved for loan returns to protect bank
money.

Tayyaba Tahir said apparently the loan scheme was attractive for youth. She said
women could improve their living standard by utilising the loan money. Tayyaba
Tahir said a number of jobs would be created with this loan scheme which would
improve GDP growth.

Amir Mukhtar said youth feared the scheme could not be for a specific group,
likewise in the past. He said that loan scheme should not be used for political
purpose and it should be transparent. Abida Shamim stressed the need for
transparent distribution of loans.

PM loan scheme & Chitralis

BYLINE: Nasir Mehmood - Chitral

SECTION: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Vol. 16 No. 146

LENGTH: 229  words


PM Nawaz Sharif's youth business loans scheme has many complicated requirements
which are to be fulfilled before submission of the loan application, like
business plan, guarantors etc. People and especially youth community fulfilled
all the conditionalities and applied for the loan with the hope that the amount
of loan will be disbursed within one or two months. It is extremely regretted
that not a single loan has been disbursed in District Chitral after passage of
five to six months.

It is requested to PM and his team to do homework before announcing haphazard
plans as such-like schemes bring embarrassment to the government. If government
has no provision to finance the loans then why they have made fool of the people
especially youth? The same case is also attached with provincial government's
self employment loans.

Disbursement of the loans by the provincial government is awaited for the last
one year.

Both provincial and federal governments badly failed in their promises of giving
employment to youth through business and employment loans. There is frustration
among youth over the delay in disbursing loans for youth employment and
responsible government officials and especially PM Nawaz Sharif and CM Pervez
Khattak are requested to take notice of the delay in disbursing of the loans for
the purpose of giving employment and business opportunities to youth.

Youth fund plans to raise loan limit to Rs 500k

LENGTH: 488 words

DATELINE: KATHMANDU


KATHMANDU, March 20 -- Despite the controversy surrounding the Youth
Self-Employment Programme (YSEP) that its loans are being misused, its
implementing agency the Youth and Small Entrepreneur Self-Employment Fund
(YSESEF) has been working to stretch the upper limit to Rs 500,000.The YSESEF is
restricted to providing loans of up to Rs 200,000 to an individual and up to Rs
5 million to a group of 25. The actual loans are provided by banks, financial
institutions and cooperatives which obtain wholesale credit from the YSESEF at
minimum interest rates.

The ambitious government programme, designed to create jobs for unemployed young
people by providing subsidized loans to start small business es, was launched in
2009.

YSESEF Executive Director Binod Guragain said they were working to hike the
maximum limit of loans due to growing complaints from aspirant youths that the
money was too little compared to their requirement. "We have started talks with
the stakeholders over the possibility of increasing the size of the loans," he
said. The fund will have to revise its regulation for this purpose.

Guragain said that bigger loans could help youths wishing to be self-employed to
start larger business es. According to him, they would need another Rs 20
billion to increase the upper limit of the potential loans to Rs 500,000 for an
individual.

The YSESEF has been considering launching the third phase of its programme under
which Rs 400 million will be distributed to create jobs for 9,000 more youths.
Its plan to increase the grant amount comes at a time when controversy has been
raging that the fund has been misused due to the influence of some political
parties.

Guragain refused to comment on the charges on the telephone. He said that
increasing the loan amount had become necessary to enable youths to start their
dream projects which might need more capital.

Meanwhile, the YSESEF has been asking Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to make a
provision that one-third of the deprived sector lending of BFIs should go to the
programme under the YSEP. "We have been holding talks with the central bank in
this regard," he added. NRB has categorised such loans under the category of
deprived sector lending, and they are provided without collateral.

The YSESEF has so far invested Rs 2.50 billion under the programme which it
claims to have provided employment to 22,000 youths. According to the fund, 60
percent of these youths are engaged in the production business .

The youth self-employment programme under the YSESEF is being run through 1,122
cooperatives in 73 districts. A total of Rs 12.3 million is being mobilized
through these cooperatives while the rest of the investment is made through
banks and financial institutions.

Materializing PM's youth schemes

BYLINE:  Prof. Dr. Asmatullah Khan

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 720

LENGTH: 2345  words


It is certainly commendable that the Prime Minister of Pakistan Mian Mohammad
Nawaz Sharif realizing the immediate need of the discouraged, deprived and
disappointed pauperized youth, on September 21st, 2013 announced allocation of
Rs. 20 billions, initially for the potential utilization and self reliant of the
Pakistani youth.

The Schemes announced comprise of; Micro Interest Free loans, Small Business
Loans, Youth Training/ Internship Programme, Youth Skill Development, Free
Assistance or Educational Support Scheme and the P.M's Laptop provision
programme. The schemes announced are indeed essential and significant for the
productive utilization of the Pakistani youth, specifically in the circumstances
prevailing today in the country.

The country is socio -economically at the verge of collapse and the general poor
masses and the youth in particular have been pushed for every disobedience,
dishonesty, illegality and crime on account of growing inflation, low per capita
income and increasing unemployment and poverty in the country. The reason of
this debilitating and deteriorating economic situation is the open corruption,
injustices, embezzlements, exploitation of the poor's and out flow of the
Pakistani capital in countries like; Middle East, USA, U.K, Malaysia, Turkey
etc', by the elite class and politicians of the country. Frankly speaking,
almost all the political ring leaders, bureaucrats and generals of this country
have foreign accounts, foreign businesses and investments in the countries
mentioned above.

The debts and debt services burden, obtained in the name of welfare and
productive socio -economic use are almost spent unchecked on the luxurious life
style of the rulers, bureaucrats and generals, while, the pay back is expected
by crushing the poor masses of the country. In addition, the non-technical and
irrelevant Finance Ministers deputed on account of their loyalty to their
political pundits have further made the country worse in all respect.

The hyper inflation, low per capita income, energy crisis, regular devaluation
of the local currency, and debilitating economy on account of non-technical and
unprofessional fiscal and monetary policies have further highly frustrated the
poor and low income masses in general. But the deprived and unemployed youth in
particular is in a great state of disappointment and deprivation. Today our
youth is wandering aimlessly in utter darkness having no future prospects, boom
and prosperity. In the circumstances prevailing in the country under such
deteriorating socio -economic conditions, the Prime Minister's development
oriented youth schemes are indeed a ray of hope to uplift the youth for national
integrity, prosperity and sovereignty. Let the announcement made may not be only
a mare promises and rosy pictures as politician always do during their election
campaign but let it may bring change in the real sense in the life style of the
Pakistani deprived youth, to make them productive segment of the society.

Today, the general poor masses and the youth of Pakistan is anxiously waiting
for a leader like Imam Khomeini of Iran, Mahathir Mohammad of Malaysia, General
Ayub Khan of Pakistan and Abdullah Gul of Turkey to bring back the looted money
and businesses opened in abroad by the corrupt politicians and other elites, on
the tax money of the poor Pakistanis. The youth is waiting for the "ONE", Who
may bring revolutionary reforms and provide them comfort, and ease in the form
of free education, comfortable shelter, sure bright future, appropriate health
care, potable water, cheap energy and transportation and appropriate employment
and living security.

Human Resource Development in the form of appropriate utilization and
mobilization of the maximum youth is a key indicator of socio -economic
development and prosperity. The announced development schemes will be successful
only if transparency, clarity, honesty, justice and merit were ensured during
its implementation and execution. In Pakistan, well decorated developmental
schemes with exaggerated rosy pictures are always floated without doing proper
homework and having proper real viable foundation and framework. Hence such
schemes floated really need to undergo critical review for its actual success.
Therefore, considering the Youth Development Packages one by one in the light of
the previous hardships and obstacles, may take us to its practicability and
success.

Micro Interest Free Educational Loans Programme: In the past, whenever, such
Micro Interest Free Loans had been offered to the unemployed young men and
women, the Bank loaning procedure was not only made complicated but remained
time consuming as well. In addition, even the Bank Loan Application Form
availability was another tedious issue, which was not freely available for the
poor students without the under the table transactions. Furthermore, the fee of
the application form was kept so high, that ordinary poor youth were even unable
to bear the cost of the loan form. Provision of guarantors and surety bonds were
another complicated and tedious procedure. Several well deserving poor students
failed even to apply due to these complicated bank procedural mechanisms.
Maturity and releases of the loans and final approval of the said bank loans for
end user was another big deal.

Providing guidelines to the inexperienced youth about the utilization of the
bank loans, in a more productive way is another task, which needs proper
counselling of the relevant authorities. In the past FATA students were also
ignored in providing educational loan facilities. Therefore, to make the scheme
successful, the government must enforce prudential regulations specifically for
easing banking procedural requirements without causing any additional cost and
efforts. It seems appropriate to open a separate cell in the Prime Minister
House under the command and control of an honest economist/ educationist to look
into such activities minutely and facilitate the recipients of the schemes
regularly. All the students be equally treated for such facilities and FATA
students in particular be given priority.

Youth Sponsored Training Scheme: The second scheme announced is the financially
supported youth training programme. It is quite an obvious known fact that the
unplanned and unjustified openings of the educational institutions only on
political grounds without providing adequate funding and relevant staff have not
only adversely affected the educational quality and standards, but have made the
youth further unproductive and unprofessional. Furthermore, our educational
system is already full of weaknesses and flaws and is not market oriented,
because our educational system is mostly theoretical rather than practical and
innovative. Consequently, our youth is mostly unsuccessful in their professional
career and practical real life.

The mushroom growths of private educational institutions without having any
appropriate check and balance, quality control and monitoring system, have
further made our educational institutions non-technical and unproductive and
have further deteriorated and derailed the youth. Open violations of merit,
corruption and political interference in educational institutions regarding
appointments of near and dears have further made our youth disappointed. Perhaps
it is the prime reason that today, mostly our youth is keen to have this simple
page of paper mentioning that the bearer is a certificate/ degree holder without
having any real knowledge, skill and professionalism.

Therefore, such public supported youth training or internships programmes could
be another revolutionary step to train the youth for future responsibilities and
professionalism. It has been observed in the past that mostly such sponsored
training schemes not only flourish and polish the youth but honestly speaking,
provide appropriate opportunities to absorb the youth in their respective
relevant institutions on the basis of their overall performance and skill, they
have developed during this internship period. Such training programmes certainly
induce more utility, potentialities and expertise amongst the educated youth
having no practical experience, skill and vision. But the success of this scheme
depends upon close coordination, faire evaluation and full support of the
training institutions as a national goal.

It will certainly be more appropriate and beneficial to make this sponsored
skill developing training essential for every youth in each discipline for all
the graduated and master students before joining any regular appointment. Such
potential inducing efforts will make our youth more productive, explorative and
constructive.

Small Business Loans Scheme: This scheme is indeed another revolutionary steep
keeping the under graduate unemployed youth engaged in small scale business
activities. Today the increasing unbearable price hikes of the daily essential
consumer goods in the country have made the low income class further deprived
and poorer. Therefore, increased poverty, growing unemployment and low per
capita income have not only deprived our youth from getting education and
initiating small scale businesses but have further pushed them to get involved
in terrorist and unlawful criminal activities. The crime rate in Pakistan has
been increased hundred times and mostly the unemployed youth is involved in
these unlawful criminal activities for the survival of their families.
Therefore, any such small business loan scheme would be a good omen in this
regard to enable the youth to earn their livelihood in a more dignified, lawful
and self-reliant ways.

But fairly speaking, the proposed 8% interest rate on the proposed provided loan
is much higher in the current deteriorating economic situation and economic
stagnation. All the businesses in Pakistan have almost been either stopped,
shifted abroad or are stagnant due to the growing expenses of the raw materials,
labour, transportation and energy costs, increasing rent and higher withholding
taxes and such other charges. The cost involved in business activities have been
almost increased more than 50%. Therefore, success of any newly established
small business in the current deteriorating economic circumstances on such a
high interest rate is not feasible. In addition, to keep the loan invested in a
more productive business, youth will require some advisory board/ counselling
system to provide significant ideas and skill about any such small productive
businesses to start, as, in our educational system, we are not having such
advisory facilities.

Furthermore, keeping close eye to avoid any misuse of such given loans would
further require complete monitoring system as well in the Prime Minister house.
Therefore, a monetary and evaluating cell need to be established to avoid misuse
of such loans and to really provide it to the needy youth without any
discrimination and bias.

Fee Assistance Scheme: Tuition Fee concession and such financial assistance
scheme for the poor students is another vital and most significant programme, to
keep the youth of the low income classes in the circle of education. Today, on
account of growing poverty, inflationary spiral and higher fee structure
prevailing in the educational institutions, specifically at private sectors,
have deprived millions of highly talented poor people out of the educational
circle. The only reason is that they cannot afford the growing high cost of
education including tuition fee, books, transportation and hostels requirements.
Therefore, the scheme announced by the Prime Minister would certainly enable the
poor's as well, to get education and to improve their skill and talent. Again
clarity, justice and honesty are required in implementing the said proposed
scheme without discrimination.

Youth Skill Development Scheme: Almost in all the developed countries, youth is
provided professional training in developing skill of the youth in different
areas. In Japan, China and Korea, training in repairing mobile phones, watches,
computer, radio, T.V, refrigerators' and electrical equipment is quite common
even at school level beside regular education. In Pakistan, we have such skill
development technical centers but their performance is worse and their role in
developing youth skill is quite negligible and nominal. Therefore, if youth
skill is developed in real terms on strong footings with proper home-work and in
real sense, the youth could be made more productive and a source of income
generation and job creation. It is suggested that Youth Skill Development Board
be constituted at national level to provide such facilities to the unemployed
youth without any bias and discrimination.

PM's Laptop Provision Programme: Computer technology is an essential tool in
education and research and today almost all the Provinces have started giving
Laptops to the outstanding students only. The Prime Minister Laptop scheme must
cover not only the outstanding students but the poor talented students must also
be awarded their genuine share in the Laptop Provision Scheme. The scheme must
be initiated to equip the real deserving students but making illegally money
through such educational schemes be avoided, as is done in some parts of the
country. It is indeed shameful, that in one Province a Laptop was purchased at
Rs. 40,000.00 but from government exchequer price per Laptop was claimed Rs. 1,
40,000.00.

It is therefore, requested that quality Laptops be purchased with honesty and
fair dealings to avoid any such losses to the government treasury. In addition,
at several places, the distribution of Laptop was not fair. Hence, complete
honesty and justice need to be observed in its distribution amongst the end
users. Further brain storming would help us to develop some patent criteria for
its distribution more justifiably, to avoid doubling, duplication, corruption
and injustices. FATA deserving students may also be considered on priority in
the Laptop Supply Scheme to keep them a brace with the information technology.

SECTION: Vol. 16 No. 10

LENGTH: 490  words


Coordinator Prime Minister Youth Loans Scheme, Marvi Memon said Thursday that PM
business loan scheme would guide youth towards self-reliance and enable them to
play constructive role in process of national development.

Talking to media persons here at the residence of PML-N District President Rehan
Malik advocate after visiting National Bank of Pakistan office, she said this
goal oriented scheme is for the youth of the whole of country and not for a
specific region. She said loans would be strictly given on merit irrespective of
political affiliation. Marvi Memon said she came here on the directives of Prime
Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif to oversee and monitor the scheme on the spot.

The main aim of this scheme is to enable unemployed youth to start their own
businesses and play constructive role in process of national development besides
strengthening of the economy.

She said youth of Fata and backwards areas of KP would be largely benefited from
this scheme, urging tribal youth to get full advantage of it as such
opportunities rarely comes and support their families on financial fronts. Also,
she expressed the hope that disabled youth would take full advantage from this
scheme. She said five percent quota of the loan was allocated for disabled
persons to help minimize their sufferings.

Marvi Memon said 50 percent of the total funds allocated for PM Youth Business
Loan Programme would be given to women to launch their own business, adding that
women of Fata and KP could also take benefit of it. She urged women of KP and
Fata to take full advantage of the scheme and  play their role in economic
development of the country.

Marvi Memon said youth would establish their own enterprises for their own
benefit after obtaining the loans and will use it for welfare of the community.
Before general election 2013, she said Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has
promised with youth that he would take solid measures to resolve the issue of
unemployment.

She said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has fulfilled the promise and now it was
the responsibility of the youth to use this money not only for their benefits
but also in development of Pakistan.

She said condition for availing the loans has been made more easier for
facilitation of youth. She said an online system has been established for
resolution of peoples' grievances and complaints and all the coordinators of the
scheme in Centre and Provinces have been assigned the task not only to review
the complaints but also take quick actions for its resolution.

Earlier, the Zonal Chief of National Bank, Muhammad Naeem Jan informed that more
than 17000 forms have been obtained from the 45 branches of NBP in DI Khan,
Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Karak, Kohat, North and South Waziristan, Hangu and Kurram
Agencies and the process of submission of forms are gaining momentum in KP and
Fata. Coordinator PM Loan Scheme for KP, Mian Rashid Ali Khan were also present
on the occasion.

CM announces self-employment project for youth

LENGTH: 654 words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Aug. 25 -- Punjab Chief Minister (CM) Shahbaz Sharif has said that the
Punjab government has evolved a revolutionary project of self-employment under
which loans worth Rs 1 billion will be given to the youth to help them stand on
their own feet.

He said this on Wednesday while presiding over a meeting for the provision of
loans to the youth under the self-employment scheme. He said that skilled youth
would be given preference under the scheme and the upper limit of loans would be
Rs 50,000. He said that the self-employment scheme would result in generation of
job opportunities as well as promotion of economic activities across the
province. The CM also issued instructions for setting up a committee which would
devise a strategy at the earliest in the light of which the scheme would be
initiated across 36 districts of the province.

He said that the Punjab government was implementing a comprehensive policy for
the generation of job opportunities in the province which included projects like
Yellow Cab Scheme, distribution of one lakh laptops among talented students and
self-employment scheme for the youth.

He said that the youth formed the majority of the province's population and
provision of loans to them under self-employment scheme would help them stand on
their own feet as well as eliminate unemployment. He said that loans of Rs 1
billion would be offered during the first year while this amount would gradually
be increased each year.

He said that the self-employment scheme would prove to be a milestone in the
elimination of unemployment and provision of job opportunities for the youth.

He said that self-employment scheme for the welfare of the youth would be
continued forever and setting up of a permanent institution for the project
should also be considered. The CM also issued instructions for selecting an
audit-company of international repute for self-employment scheme and said that
the Punjab Small Industries Corporation would distribute these loans through
Akhuwat, an organisation that offers marginalised families interest-free micro
finance. He said that Akhuwat had a wide experience of public service and
provision of loans and would execute this welfare project in a transparent
manner. He said that loans would be given to the youth under self-employment
scheme in all districts of the province and special committees comprising
experts and persons enjoying good repute would also be formed at the district
level for monitoring the loans.

He said that such youth should be given preference in the provision of loans
that was experienced in various skills and trades so that they could set up such
businesses that not only leave a positive impact on economy but also generate
further employment opportunities. He said that the guiding policy for the
provision of loans and other matters should soon be given a final shape so that
the scheme could be started at the earliest.

He said that the Akhuwat should further enhance its capacity and submit a plan
within seven days for the distribution of loans under the self-employment
scheme. MNA Khawaja Saad Rafiq, chief secretary, chairman Planning and
Development, secretaries of Finance, Law and Social Welfare, TEVTA and Punjab
Vocational Training Council chairmen, Akhuwat executive director and experts
also attended the meeting.

Later, while heading to another meeting, the CM gave approval in principle to
the setting up of a modern fruit and vegetable market at Kacha on Ferozepur Road
and constituted a committee to take all possible measures for the completion of
the project within a year. He also issued instructions for provision of
necessary facilities as soon as possible in the vegetable market shifted from
Kot Lakhpat. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Times. For

Young entrepreneurs bag banks' backing: Loans, advice, online programs to
unearth Canada's 'hidden deficit' in unemployed youth, says director of new
federation: Applicants must apply to committees

BYLINE: SOUTHAM NEWS; CANADIAN PRESS

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 635 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


CIBC and Royal Bank announced Tuesday they have put up $ 5.5 million to back a
new youth business foundation.

The Canadian Youth Business Foundation will lend up to $ 15,000 to individuals,
find volunteer mentors to provide guidance, and will soon establish an Internet
service for small businesses.

The non-profit foundation opens in May to Canadians aged 18-29. Its sponsors
expect it to create more than 5,000 new businesses during the next five years.

"Unemployed youth are Canada's hidden deficit," said Lucie Bohac Konrad,
executive-director of the Canadian Youth Federation.

Youth unemployment now hovers at 15.6 per cent, much higher than the national
rate of 9.5 per cent. Many young Canadians are stuck with part-time or
short-term work, Konrad said, while many drop out of the workforce altogether.

Two years ago, Konrad approached CIBC with an idea patterned after the Prince's
Youth Business Trust, a U.K. foundation with more than 10 years' experience in
Britain and Ireland.

The idea was to help unemployed youth become entrepreneurs. Unlike the Prince's
Trust, the Canadian foundation would be privately funded.

The banks agreed. CIBC is putting up a $ 7-million line of credit -- at cost --
to cover loans, on top of its $ 3-million startup contribution. The Royal is
putting up the other $ 2.5 million.

The Canadian foundation is to provide up to 150 loans from its Vision Fund
during its first year, increasing this number each year. The pilot project
begins next month in London, Ont., with sites in Halifax, Scarborough, Ont., and
Calgary to follow.

Loan applicants must apply to local volunteer committees for the funds. A
maximum of $ 15,000 would be lent at prime rates; only the interest is payable
for the first year. Interest from the loans would be channelled back into the
foundation.

While applicants need a solid business plan, they don't need collateral. To
qualify, they must not be eligible for normal loans or funding programs.

The banks are lending this money through a foundation because they believe many
of the loans are too risky for traditional bank credit.

"We expect about 25 per cent of these businesses will fail," said Holger Kluge,
president of CIBC's Personal and Commercial Bank.

If that seems optimistic, Kluge points out the British success rate of the
businesses helped by the Prince's Youth Business Trust is 70 per cent; in
Ireland, it's 78 per cent. The key to the success in the U.K. was getting
volunteer mentors with business experience involved.

"When the trust began in Ireland, without mentors, the success rate was only 40
per cent," Kluge said.

Konrad said hundreds of experienced business people, many retired, have
expressed interest in volunteering a few hours a week.

Other foundation sponsors include Air Canada, IBM Canada, the Bank of Montreal,
George Weston Ltd., Baton Broadcasting Inc., Price Waterhouse Canada, Husky Oil
Ltd. and Canadian Business Media Ltd.

Later this month, the foundation will launch a World Wide Web site,
(http://www.cybf.ca) to provide young entrepreneurs with a place to advertise,
share information and discuss concerns.

Getting the program

How the youth entrepreneurship program would work:

Ideas sought: Entrepreneurs aged 18-29 with good idea backed by a business plan
can apply.

Goal: Foundation wants to write 5,000 loans of up to $ 15,000 over five years.
Average loan will be $ 7,500. Expected to create up to five jobs for each
venture.

Backup advice: Volunteer mentoring program will help with assistance and advice.
The foundation is looking for a 75-per-cent success rate for the loans.

Online: Information, advice, networking, and discussions will also be available
on the foundation's web site site by the end of April.

Engines of socio-economic change

BYLINE: Nauman Ashraf

SECTION: Vol. XXVIII No. 102

LENGTH: 833  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif presided over the second computerised balloting for
a grant of 6000 loans to youth including women, under the Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loans Scheme on Wednesday.

The first balloting held recently also disbursed loans to the same number of men
and women. The Youth Business Loan Scheme initiative differs from the previously
failed schemes because it is being implemented through commercial banks who can
take care of all aspects of the loans without political interference in line
with the policies chalked out by the government.

Another aspect is government commitment to ensure the utmost transparency in
advancing these loans to make sure that they are given only to the most
deserving. The third salient feature of the scheme is the element of gender
equality. These loans will range between five hundred thousand to two million
rupees; a fair amount for starting a personal business, and providing excellent
opportunities to skilled, qualified and professional men and women to explore
and set up avenues of self-employment in a dignified way.

The Prime Minister announced the launch of six different schemes in September
2013, namely the Small Business Loans Scheme, Micro Interest free Scheme, Youth
Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme, Fee Assistance Scheme and the
PM Scheme for Laptops. The interest-free loan scheme for youth announced on 13th
May will benefit one million individuals, costing Rs.3.5 billion to the
exchequer. The scheme envisaging the disbursement of loans up to Rs.50,000
through Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund will cover the entire country,
especially rural and far flung areas with 50% of the share going to young women.

The launch of the interest free loan scheme targets the poor and underprivileged
sections of society.

Similarly, the Fee Assistance Scheme for students from far-flung and
comparatively less developed areas of the country aims not only to facilitate
the youth of those areas to pursue higher studies unfazed by the paucity of
resources, but will be a tremendous help to the concerned families as well. The
Youth Skills Development Scheme that envisages the imparting of technical
training to boys and girls who have studied up to the eighth level and on the
job training for graduates with a monthly scholarship of Rs.10,000 are also
prudent policy initiatives.

The status of the youth of a nation as architects of its future progress and
prosperity, has unqualified universal recognition and that is why nations all
over the world focus considerable attention on harnessing the potential of their
young generations-their human capital--through imparting education and skill.

In most developing and poor countries, a lack of education, finances and
technological skills are the biggest hindrances to gainful employment. Thus,
growing un-employment amongst the youth not only affects the economic progress
of that country but also unleashes disastrous consequences for the society in
the shape of lawlessness and crimes.

The idea of targeting the youth from less privileged classes gained currency
during the early 50's and became a wide spread phenomenon in the 80's. Now, it
forms an integral part of any growth model in the developing world. The strategy
adopted was to provide micro-credit to the youth for setting up their own
businesses, small industries, improving their technological skills for enhancing
their chances of employability, or pursing higher education. This is regarded as
a very vital ingredient of sustained economic growth. Bangladesh and Nepal in
our region, who adopted this growth model are far ahead of us at the moment
though they were far behind us to start with.

The package for the youth announced by the PML (N) government, is an imaginative
move to tackle unemployment amongst the youth and enhances their skills and
capability to engage productively in a national effort to change the
socio-economic landscape of the country.

Though Rs.100 billion allocated for the purpose may seem like peanuts to some in
view of snowballing unemployment amongst the youth, it is still a very
substantial leap in the right direction. Economic recovery permitting and by
more resources becoming available within the government, these allocations are
sure to be enhanced and the scheme will be made a permanent feature of the
national economic strategy.

The country can move forward only when there are greater employment
opportunities in the private sector. Pakistan's government at present, employs
only 7% of the work force and with more and more people joining the labour
market, the private sector has to play a wider and more expansive role in this
area. Pakistani youth are around 35-40% of the total population, and any move
that ensures and guarantees their gainful employment is bound to accelerate the
process of economic progress due to its multiplier effect, besides of course,
enhancing the tax revenues of the government that this newly initiated economic
activity will generate.

Keiyo DC Warns Youth of Stiff Action for Abusing Loan Cash

BYLINE: Mathews Ndanyi

LENGTH: 275  words


A large percentage of money disbursed under the youth fund has been misused by
youth groups, a district commissioner said yesetrday. Some of the youth leaders
have misused the money to engage in immorality and marry instead of investing in
business and create jobs. Keiyo North DC Abbas Mohammed says some of the youth
could be arrested if they do not account for the loan money. He says the money
was meant to empower the youth economically but most youth groups failed to
invest it as planned.

Mohammed warned the beneficiaries against diverting the funds to unplanned
projects stating that they would be compelled to repay the same to enable others
to benefit from the revolving kitty. He expressed dismay over some of the
leaders of youth groups whom misused the money, yet the loans were meant to
empower them economically and socially. "It is discouraging to note that a
section of the leaders who are heading a number of youths groups were spending
the money on immorality while others spend it to marry more wives," Mohammed
said

The DC made the remarks outside his office in Iten town where he presided over
the disbursement of Sh3 million cheque to youth groups and individuals who had
applied for loans from the Ministry of Youth Affairs.

Mohammed, who was accompanied by the district youth affair officer Isaac
Nabibia, said some of youth groups were doing well in loan repayment in the

benefit more from the kitty.

Nabibia advised the youth to identify income generating projects that would
bring them good returns and enable them repay the loans without any hassle.

Tough conditions keep youth from PM's loan scheme

BYLINE: Irfan Haider

SECTION: Vol. LXVIII No. 144

LENGTH: 857  words


With a master's degree in agriculture, Awad Shah, 24, has been searching for a
job for the last two years.

"During my study at the Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, I never expected
that I would have to wait for such a long time to get a job," Shah told Dawn.

He said after failing to get a job, he tried to start his own business but could
not launch it due to lack of resources.

Shah said the initiation of the prime minister's youth business loan scheme had
given him a ray of hope to start his own business.

Since December 2013, only 5,414 youth have obtained the loans across the country

"I was interested in getting a loan to start a fertilizer business but could not
meet the terms and conditions of the scheme."

He said initially he faced difficulty in finding a guarantor but later one of
his relatives agreed to stand guarantee for me.

But the bank's tough conditions forced him to withdraw from the
process.According to the requirements, it is the guarantor, not the borrower,
who has to enter into an agreement with the bank on a specified format.

"It is illogical to transfer the burden of the loan to the guarantor," he added.

Zafar Bangash, 27, of Sector G-9 also wanted to start his own business of
poultry farm in his native town of Kohat.

"I completed my master's degree in business administration from Quaid-i-Azam
University in 2010 but still remain unemployed."

He said the agreement should be between the applicant and the bank. It seems the
government is going to give loans to the guarantors, not the unemployed youth.

He suggested that the loan should be provided against the applicants' own or
their parents' property.

The government should review the terms and conditions of the loan if it wants to
benefit the youth.

"I have been working in a medical store in Islamabad for seven years and wanted
to start my own business but the government announced the business loan with an
eight per cent mark-up which is unjustified," said 35-year-old Raja Murad of
Bhara Kahu.

Naeema Iqbal, 26, who lives in Satellite Town in Rawalpindi, said she wanted to
open an embroidery and sewing centre in her native district of Gilgit.

"My area is famous for different designs of embroidery on clothes. I wanted to
open a centre and engage the local women artisans and provide them better
wages."

She said it was difficult for her to initiate any business without getting an
interest-free loan.

"I do not think that I will be able to earn profits from the business after
paying the interest on the loan," she added.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the loan scheme on December 7, 2013.

It was decided that citizens aged between 21 and 45 with entrepreneurial
potential would be eligible for the scheme with 50 per cent quota reserved for
women.

Under the Rs100 billion scheme, 100,000 loans would be given to young
entrepreneurs to launch small businesses. The loans will range from Rs100,000 to
a maximum of Rs2 million.

The borrower would pay an eight per cent annual interest rate, whereas the
lending institutions will charge approximately 15 per cent in annual interest.

The government will subsidise the loans by covering the borrowing cost for the
difference between the rates charged by lenders and the eight per cent paid by
the borrowers.

Officials in the ministry of finance said around 5,414 youth - 348 from Sindh,
76 from Balochistan, 4,128 from Punjab, 675 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven from
Gilgit-Biltistan, 75 from Azad Kashmir and 105 from the federal capital - had so
far obtained loans under the scheme.

The officials said the government was considering excluding the condition of a
guarantor but the banks were reluctant to accept it.

Former caretaker finance minister Dr Salman Shah said it was a good initiative
of the government but for the applicants it was also not easy to find a
guarantor.

But he also said it would be difficult for the banks to provide loans without a
guarantor.

He said the government should reduce the rate of interest or provide
interest-free loans to the youth.

When contacted, Finance Secretary Dr Waqar Masood Khan acknowledged that the
applicants were facing problems in finding guarantors. But it is also difficult
for the banks to provide loans without a guarantor, he added.

"Who will return the loans to the banks if the loan seekers did not provide a
guarantor," he asked.

Riphah International University Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Anis Ahmad said the
youth were suffering due to the unemployment and extremist groups always tried
to get advantage of the situation.

"Under such circumstances, any scheme that engages the youth in productive
activities must be welcomed. But there is no concept of Riba or interest in
Islam."

He said the government should introduce interest-free loan schemes for the
youth.

When contacted, PPP leader Fawad Chaudhry said the government initiated the loan
scheme without proper planning.

"Unsuspecting individuals will end up borrowing huge sums for projects they will
not be able to plan or execute while the defaulted amounts will be added to the
ever-growing public debt," he said.

Chairperson of the youth scheme Maryam Nawaz could not be contacted for
comments.

potential will be eligible for the scheme with 50 per cent quota reserved for
women.

First Women Bank will execute the scheme while  other banks may join in after
approval of their respective business-plans.

Loans will range from Rs. 0.5 to 2.0 million with average loan size of Rs 1.25
million. The debt-equity ratio for these schemes will be 90:10 with tenure of
seven years.

Jobless Youths Engage in Farming to Raise Collateral for Bank Loans

BYLINE: Mwangi Muiruri

LENGTH: 653 words


Investment groups dealing in farming activities are helping the youth get round
the problem of raising collateral for bank loans, a key hindrance for them to
start small enterprises.

Through dairy, horticulture and coffee farming groups, financial institutions
are advancing money to youth groups on the strength of cashflow from their
produce.

This has seen the youths collectively accumulate wealth through farming, an
occupation that has for long been regarded a preserve of pensioners or the
uneducated.

In the Kangocho area of Nyeri County, for instance, youths have formed coffee
farming self-help groups that are helping them get credit.

One group - Big River Revolving Fund - has 15 members who are reaping gains from
565 coffee stems.

"Our coffee accounts have enabled us to qualify for bank loans, which we in turn
use to diversify our activities," said Geoffrey Mwangi, 26, a member of the
group.

A well tended coffee stem produces 30kg of cherry in a season.

With the latest payment for coffee at Sh133 a kilogramme the group earned more
than Sh2.2 million from which each member received Sh150,000.

Their initial capital was raised from proceeds of casual labour.

The group started four years ago opened a bank account soon after they began
coffee deliveries.

With the help of experts, they developed a business plan and negotiated a credit
of Sh91,000.

"They helped us gather the financial data that persuaded lenders we were worth
the risk," says Mr Mwangi. Kangocho Tea factory chairman Joseph Wachira says:
"They have been accessing bank loans and investing in boda boda (motorcycle
taxi) transport as well as using the credit to buy dairy cows."

The youths get loans of up to Sh70,000 each in turns.

"Youths are getting frustrated in accessing the Youth Enterprise Development
Fund. Rather than wait for the fund to be streamlined, they have set out to
explore their own means of accessing credit," says parliamentary Budget
Committee chairman Elias Mbau.

Mr Joseph Ngumi, a small medium enterprise and technological transfer expert,
says that the Big River Revolving Fund model should be emulated by other young
investors.

"Banks will always favour an established person with a solid credit rating and
business plans that show the ability to repay the loans.

If you are not the one, then you have to contend with frustrations in accessing
personal development loans," he says.

Mr Ngumi, who works with the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, blames the education
system for not exposing the youth to the basics of entrepreneurship. This he
adds is to blame for the high level of youth unemployment as graduates flock
urban areas seeking formal employment.

"Youths should cease looking forward to being formally employed, and pursue
empowerment through credit and expert advice on credit sourcing and
investments," he says, adding that many youths walk into a bank without the
slightest idea of how much they want to borrow or how they would repay the loan.

Mary Kamuyu, 24, the owner of Drop Lake Dispenser Services and Solutions, says
she operated a boutique business for more than two years before she could borrow
Sh200,000.

The water dispenser cleaning company she started five months ago, while repaying
the loan from her boutique business, is tending towards breaking even.

"I had to start from scratch when I established the boutique in Nairobi," she
says.

However, she expressed fears that the escalating interest rates may lock out
many youths seeking to raise capital for business.

"I was charged an interest rate of 18 per cent besides the Sh5,000 loan
application fee. Fortunately, my new company is doing well and I am almost
through with repayment," she says.

Her next stop, says Ms Kamunyu, is the Women Enterprise Development Fund where
she intends to borrow Sh300,000 to buy a small truck to help her cut on hired
transport costs.

"Adding value to my business will guarantee me collateral for more credit," she
says.

Govt to provide loan from basket fund

BYLINE: HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE

LENGTH: 333  words


KATHMANDU: The government is planning to provide self-reliant loan to youth from
a basket fund that was created for employment in 2008-09.

"The fund has around Rs 5 billion that will be distributed to start small
businesses," said vice-chairman of National Planning Commission Diprendra
Bahadur Chhetri.

"In the beginning, banks and financial institutions will issue loans to youth
against project collateral and that will be reimbursed later," he said, adding
that banks and financial institutions should not loose their investment from
participating in youth self-reliant programme.

The government is also thinking to insure loan issued under self-reliant
programme. "We are exploring possibility of reducing burden from financial
institutions and the government," he said, adding that the procedure will be
finalised within two weeks.

Prime Minister Dr Baburam Bhattarai aimed at providing soft loan to 50,000
youths to make them self-reliant through his relief package announced last week.

The programme is a duplication of Small Business and Youth Self-reliant
programme of Maoist government introduced three years ago. Youth applied last
time will get priority in getting loan to start their projects. "We call them to
participate in the programme soon," he said, adding that some 50,000 youth will
get jobs under the programme.

According to him, the programme is alternate to foreign job dependency. About
1,500 Nepali youths are leaving the country to join foreign jobs every day due
to lack of opportunities back home.

According to an estimate, about 450,000 Nepalis enter the job market every year
and around 300,000 join foreign jobs, around 50,000 get jobs in the country and
equal number of youths are unemployed.

Youths having business skills will get soft loan of up to Rs 200,000 for their
project and the government will provide 60 per cent subsidy on interest.

However, the programme had failed in 2008-09 as banks and financial institutions
were reluctance to float loans to youth projects.

Youth loan scheme launched

BYLINE:  ZAHEER ABBASI

SECTION: Vol. XLIX No. 336

LENGTH: 742  words


The government on Saturday launched Prime Minister''s ''Youth Loan Scheme'' to
provide Rs 100 billion loans to one hundred thousand youth through balloting in
the next seven months of the current fiscal year. Speaking at the launch
ceremony, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said application forms would be available
from designated branches of banks from Monday. He said the government would also
launch a low-cost housing scheme for the poor.

He vehemently criticised the nationalisation policy of 1970, saying that
nationalisation proved disastrous for the economy. The Prime Minister added that
Pakistan has remained far behind in the economic development as compared to
other regional countries and even some African countries were far ahead of
Pakistan in terms of economic development. He said the government has decided to
privatise loss making public sector enterprises, including Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA), so that these could be turned into profit-making
units. Nawaz Sharif stated that the government''s primary duty is to provide
security to the people, to solve the problems of terrorism and sectarianism and
lack of businesses. He said that the volume of corruption has decreased during
the last six months and the prices of essential commodities, which have been on
the rise due to price hike of fuel and other commodities in the international
markets, have declined. He complained that media was critical of the government
when the prices of tomatoes and other vegetables were rising due to shortage;
but has not acknowledged government''s efforts towards bringing the rates of
these items down. The Prime Minister said that loadshedding has been
significantly reduced but the problems would remain in the next four to five
years. He said the government intends to add 15000 MW to the system by
constructing Diamer-Basha, Dasu and other dams.

He said the loans would be provided to 15000 youths every month through ballot
at eight percent mark-up through National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank.
The remaining 7 percent mark-up would be paid by the government and youth
between 21 to 45 years would be eligible for the loan from 0.1 million to 2
million. The loan tenor would be seven years plus one year grace period for the
youth across country including Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and Fata.

He said that during his election campaign, he was distressed to see the
unemployed educated youth in his public meeting and wanted to do something about
them. Nawaz Sharif said that influential people have been taking billions of
rupees loans from the banks but no one is ready to give loan to the 60 percent
of the youth who could make great contribution to the economy. The Prime
Minister said the chief of Standard Chartered Bank was ready to provide support
to his youth loan scheme.

Earlier, chairperson of Prime Minister''s Youth Business Loans Maryam Nawaz said
the government has fulfilled election promise by launching the loan scheme for
the youth despite financial problems. She said there are only three conditions
for the applicants; (i) they should be Pakistani; (ii) holder of valid
Computerised National Identity Card and (iii) should have a guarantor. There
would be no cost for the form, however, processing fee Rs 100 per applicant
would be charged. She said that special counters have been set up at banks and
SMEDA offices to facilitate applicants and guide them. Application form would be
available from Monday at 1400 branches of banks across the country and 50
percent loan would be provided to women and five per cent quota has been for
widows. She said that application process time has been fixed from 15 to 25
days.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the government has inherited a broken economy
and adopted austerity in all the ministries and division and reduced their
expenditures by 30 per cent and discretionary fund of Prime Minister was also
abolished. He said that despite financial problems the government is going to
implement one point of the election manifesto. He said the number of foreign
missions is also being slashed to save Rs 3.5 billion. Dar stated that banks
required fulfilling their social responsibility as well in line with the State
Bank of Pakistan''s circular 9, dated 29th November 2013 and now it is
obligatory upon all the banks to contribute to Prime Minister''s initiative. He
expressed the hope that other banks would also join NBP and First Women Bank
from Tuesday.

Banks disburse Rs8bln to unemployed youth

BYLINE: Erum Zaidi

SECTION: Vol. 26 No. 189

LENGTH: 341  words


Banks extended Rs8.145 billion in credit to the unemployed youth under the Prime
Minister Youth Business Loans (PMYBL) scheme during the second quarter (April to
June) of the current calendar year, registering 10 percent growth over the
previous quarter, the central bank said on Friday.

Banks lent Rs7.429 billion in loans to the youth in January-March 2016, said the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in its quarterly review on Prime Minister Youth
Business Loans. Total number of Prime Minister Youth Business Loansbeneficiaries
stood at 8,472 in the second quarter as against 7,816 in the first quarter.

Analysts said the low-cost lending to jobless youth is rising as more banks are
joining the scheme for creating start-ups and extending the business enterprises
for the young people. Terms for the repayments of the loans are also generous,
they said.

Some analysts, however, said though the credit availability for the youth is
better than a year ago banks are still reluctant to increase their exposures due
to the risks in such loans. The SBP said the National Bank of Pakistan lent
Rs7.775 billion to the youth and followed by the First Women Bank (Rs157
million).

However, the private lenders, working as executive agents, provided the credit
worth Rs214 million. Under the scheme, the banking system is providing a loan of
up to two million rupees to the unemployed youth for setting up or expanding a
business at a six percent service charge per annum.

The rate of return for banks is one year Karachi Interbank Offered Rate plus 500
basis points with the rate to be reset every year. Portfolio risk coverage of up
to five percent is also available under the scheme for the banks.

In Apr-Jun quarter, the number of PMYBL executing agencies increased to 18.
Prime Minister Youth Business Loans data indicated that the participating banks
received 7,679 applications under the scheme during the quarter under review.
Total numbers of applicants rose to 71,644; of that, shares of male and female
applications are 86 and 14 percent, respectively.

PM unveils youth empowerment plan

BYLINE:  Our Staff Reporter

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 206

LENGTH: 716  words


Announcing a Rs20 billion youth assistance and development programme, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that it is time to make the youth of this country
self-reliant through affordable education, soft loans and skill-based training.

The programme comprises six schemes: Micro Interest Free Loans Scheme, Small
Business Loans Scheme, Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme,
Fee Assistance Scheme and PM's Scheme for Laptops Provision.

In his televised address to the nation Saturday night, Premier Sharif said, "I
am sure that a self-reliant and prosperous youth will prove as a vanguard in the
nation's journey towards national integrity, prosperity and sovereignty."

The prime minister announced that the youth of all the four provinces, Azad
Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan could benefit from these development programmes. PM
Nawaz urged the general public to send their written proposals on these schemes
over 10 days.

About 'Micro Interest Free Loans', the PM said it is especially focussed upon
the financially weak segments of society. Under it, a total of Rs3.5 billion
would be earmarked this financial year which would benefit about 250,000 people.

He also announced Small Business Loan Scheme for the educated youth willing to
start their own businesses. Skilled individuals would get loans worth Rs0.5 to
Rs2 million each to help start their work in agriculture sector or set up a
workshop, and 50 percent loans under this Rs5 billion scheme would be specified
for the women. "The markup rate on this loan would be 8 percent as the remaining
markup amount would be borne by the government.

The third initiative, he said was Youth Training Scheme under which the youth
having completed 16-year education would be provided training so they may find
suitable jobs. The prime minister said during the on-job training, the youth
will be paid Rs10,000 stipend per month for one year. He said this Rs4 billion
scheme would benefit around 50,000 graduates.

Under the Youth Skill Development Scheme, he said, youngsters would be trained
to help them earn their livelihood. The youth aged up to 25 years and with
education up to eighth grade would be entitled to avail this facility under this
Rs800 million scheme. "These youths will be trained for six months and will be
paid Rs5,000 a month as stipend. However, the fee of the training institutes
will be borne by the government," he said.

The fifth scheme is for providing assistance to youth of underdeveloped areas
for their tuition fees. The PM said government would pay for the tuition fees of
all deserving students at masters level and above. For this purpose, Rs1.2
billion has been allocated which would cover the expenses of some 30,000
students with an average of Rs40,000 yearly.

Under the Prime Minister's Scheme for Provision of Laptops, one million students
would be given laptops with an amount of Rs4 billion. The scheme, which was
first introduced in Punjab, had been extended to the whole country in view of
the importance of information technology.

"The main idea behind the programme is to increase the self-dependency of the
youth and provide them job opportunities. Globally the job opportunities in
government sector have been shrinking continuously and in Pakistan too these
opportunities are on the wane when seen in the perspective of the fast growing
population," he said.

Making a case for privatisation of sick national entities, the prime minister
lamented that they were eating up Rs500 billion each year. The money being
wasted here should be spent on public welfare instead, he said.

He said that one of the reasons for malfunctioning of the government run
institutes was the unnecessary inductions done on the political basis. The
examples of PIA, Pakistan Steel Mills and Pakistan Railways were before the
nation, he added. The PM said in presence of a strong private sector, the people
especially the youth would get better job opportunities.

Economy of Pakistan should be strengthened in such a way that it did not require
loan or foreign aid. He said his government has a strong will and they were
confident that Pakistan would soon overcome the problems. He said these were the
promises PML-N made during election campaign and it wanted a system in which
youth could earn by itself and help others.

laundry facilities at IBA Sukkur and COMSATS Islamabad.

Nawaz launches youth business loans programme

SECTION: Vol. IV No. 152

LENGTH: 626  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has launched 'Youth Business Loans' to help
young entrepreneurs to initiate their own businesses.

It is designed to provide subsidized financing at eight percent mark-up per
annum for one hundred thousand beneficiaries through National Bank of Pakistan
and First Women Bank.

The total mark up rate would be fifteen percent but the Government would pay the
remaining seven percent on behalf of applicants.

Those falling in the age group of 21 and 45 years are eligible to apply for
loans from one hundred thousand to two million rupees.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years plus one year grace period
and a debt-equity ratio of 90:10 will be disbursed across the country including
four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas.

SMEDA has been tasked with an advisory role in the implementation of Prime
Minister's scheme. Nawaz has said he is fulfilling the commitments made with the
youth during election campaign.

Speaking at the launching ceremony, he said it is a big contradiction that loans
worth billions of rupees are doled out to influential and resourceful people but
underprivileged segments of the population are deprived of the opportunities.

The PM said youth in other countries are backbone of their economies and there
is no reason that youth who constitutes sixty percent of our population should
not take us to zenith of progress and development. Nawaz said in the past
nationalization of industries and banks destroyed the national economy.

He said our previous government denationalised and privatized the banks and now
they are earning billions of rupees and paying taxes to the government. He said
now the present government is going towards privatization of the entities.

Nawaz said it is not job of the government to run factories rather it should
concentrate on improving law and order situation, weeding out terrorism,
addressing sectarianism, and improving image of the country.

The PM said during his recent visit to the United States President Obama and
senior members of his administration repeatedly asked one question as to what
the United States can do to help Pakistan. Mian Nawaz Sharif said he told them
that Pakistan needs more access to your markets and not any financial aid.

Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans Chairwoman
Maryam Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of the Nawaz Sharif's
election commitments.

She said others only made pledges but the PML-N government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.

Maryam said there are only three conditions for the applicants - they should be
Pakistani, holder of valid computerised national identity card and should have a
guarantor.

She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free. Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA
offices to facilitate applicants and guide them.

She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans. The chairwoman said necessary checks have
been put in place to ensure transparency of the loans.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current year's budget are practically being implemented.

He said Nawaz abolished his discretionary fund and the government slashed
expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other ministries and divisions
by 30 percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also being slashed to
save 3.5 billion rupees.

He pointed out that Pakistan's position improved by twelve points in corruption
index prepared by Transparency International.

Youth aid debuts in Scarborough Foundation offers low loan rates, up to $15,000

   Angelita Elliot played hard ball with her bankers on gain financing for her
business.

"I decided to use reverse psychology on them," said Elliot, 29, who imports and
distributes all-natural herbal products, such as soap and shampoo, made in the
United States.

Convinced she would be a success, Elliot told her bank she would leave if it
wouldn't support her, even though she had only $30 in her bank account at the
time and had used up all her embryonic business's start-up funds.

The bank balked, and Elliot kept her word, taking her business to another
lender.

The gutsy Elliot was on hand yesterday to hear of a program being launched in
Scarborough to help young entrepreneurs and fight youth unemployment.

The Canadian Youth Business Foundation will provide low-interest loans of up to
$15,000 to 18- to 29-year-olds with business plans, and will offer business
advice and support. The average loan is expected to be about $7,500.

From an estimated 150 loans in the first year, Canadian Youth Business
Foundation aims to help launch more than 5,000 businesses by the year 2000. The
venture plans to expand to six sites by April and open 50 to 70 sites around the
country within five years.

Launched in April, the Canadian Youth Business Foundation is sponsored entirely
by the private sector and has raised $6.8 million to date. The founding
partners, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the Royal Bank of Canada,
are down for more than $5 million of the total.

Yesterday, Leslie Dan, chairman and chief executive officer of Novopharm Ltd.,
said his company will kick in $250,000 over the next five years.

Joan Mohammed, the foundation's regional director for central Canada, said the
goal is to raise $12 million within five years.

The first loan office opened in London, Ont. Of 17 business plans submitted to
the loan-approval committee, six got funding.

The loan-approval committee, drawn from volunteers in the banking, business and
academic fields, meets to discuss business plans about every six weeks.

Youth Business officials are expecting demand for the program to be much higher
in Scarborough than in London, due to higher unemployment among Scarborough's
youth.

"I think we're going to be inundated," Mohammed said.

"We're anticipating putting out 40 to 50 loans in the first year," said Mitch
Lenko, director of the Centre for Entrepreneurship at the Progress Campus of
Centennial College.

"This is going to fill a real vacuum that we've had in the past," he said.

The banks are reluctant to handle such small loans through branches. The loans
are unlikely to produce a profit, since about 25 per cent of the new ventures
are expected to fail.

Youth loan scheme to be relaunched

DATELINE: Ipoh


IPOH, Mon. - The National Youth Economic Trust Fund, which was frozen last
year pending revision of its structure, will be relaunched on Thursday.

The revised loan scheme, will among others, provide a more flexible
repayment period and is expected to cater to a wider group of young
entrepreneurs.

Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, in disclosing this
today, said the fund was expected to service some 2,000 young
entrepreneurs per year for the next five years.

Previously, the scheme catered to about 700 youths.

First launched in 1988, the trust fund is operated under the Youth-in-
Business Programme, started in 1974.

"The old repayment period of six months was regarded as too rigid. The
present repayment period will give youths a more flexible repayment period
depending on the viability of their venture.

"This includes the time frame of returns in profit," he told reporters
after briefing State youth leaders on the Premier Youth Development Agenda
Programme.

Muhyiddin said only those in the 18 to 30 age group who are identified
through entrepreneur development courses conducted by the ministry were
entitled to apply for loans.

"The maximum loan is RM50,000 which is meant to help them start off in
their business. For bigger loans, youths are advised to approach financial
institutions," he said.

A service charge of two per cent is charged per annum, he added.

He added that to date loans totalling about RM17 million had been given
out.

"We are negotiating with the Treasury for a RM50 million revolving fund,
with about RM10 million to be given out annually for the next five years.
We hope to give out loans to about 2,000 young entrepreneurs every year,"
he said.

Muhyiddin said the revised scheme was expected to overcome some of the
earlier problems encountered, including the inability of some youths to
repay the loans within the stipulated time.

Muhyiddin also said that while the young entrepreneurs were divided into
categories such as businessmen, farmers and planters before, the present
scheme will lump them under a single banner.

He also said a report on the status of some 9,000 youth organisations in
the country would be ready soon.

"With the data, we will be able to deal with issues such as activating
dormant organisations and also help overcome some of the problems
encountered by them," he said.

On the Rakan Muda programme, Muhyiddin said RM170 million would be
sought under the Seventh Malaysia Plan to help set up at least one Rakan
Muda centre in each of the 165 districts in the country.

Youth Business Loans process based on merit: PM

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 803

LENGTH: 519  words


Prime Minister, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has said that the conditions for the
guarantors in the Youth Business Loan Scheme have been eased keeping in view the
difficulties faced by the youth.

He said that now any person including blood relatives / family member having net
worth of 1.5 times the loan can give the guarantee. Further, any Grade-15 or
above Government officer with 8 or more years of remaining service can be a
guarantor. More than one person with cumulative net worth of more than 1.5 times
the loan can give collective guarantees on single loan application. Anyone with
net worth more than 1.5 times the loan can give his own guarantee. Moreover,
applicant's bank account can be in any bank including National Bank of Pakistan,
the Prime Minister said.

Prime Minister said this in his address to the applicants of Youth Business loan
scheme at Hyderabad, Sind.

Prime Minister said that we have to trust our youth and want to give them
financial independence so that they can play their positive role in economy of
the country. He told that the recovery in the Yellow cab scheme in our last
government was around 99% and we have complete trust in our youth and have
confidence that they will utilize this loan amount productively.

Prime Minister said that previously the loans were given only to big
personalities & entities and the small loan borrowers were neglected. We have
decided to award loans to small borrowers in order to give benefit to the
skilled youth and lower strata of the society. This will not only benefit the
small borrowers but their families and people who will get employed in these
projects. The number of the beneficiaries will run into hundreds of thousands,
PM added. Prime Minister said that this is a programme launched for the youth
who are the builders of Pakistan.

Prime Minister further said that we have ensured transparency at every level in
the process of awarding loans. "Not even my "Safarish" (preferential
recommendation) will be accepted in it", PM said. He said that the culture of
favoritism and nepotism is a cancer which has eaten up our society and we want
to ensure transparency and merit at every level in the government. Later, the
Prime Minister met the applicants and inquired from each of them about their
plans after getting the loan. The applicants were enthusiastic to find Prime
Minister amongst them and said that the loan scheme would help them to utilize
their skills not only for the benefit of their own selves but their families and
society at large too.

Speaking about infrastructure projects in Sind, the Prime Minister said that we
have a comprehensive plan to build road network in Hyderabad and Karachi, adding
that the Japanese Government has shown interest in Karachi Circular Railway
Project and the project would be initiated soon. Federal Minister for
Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage Senator Pervaiz Rashid and Chief
Minister Sind Mr. Qaim Ali Shah and other senior government officials were also
present at the occasion.

Earlier upon his arrival Prime Minister was received by Chief Minister Sindh,
Mr. Qaim Ali Shah.

Youths Blast Banks

BYLINE: Albert Chavhunduka

LENGTH: 286 words


Zanu-PF's Department of Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment has castigated
local banks for failing to disburse funds for youth programmes.

At a media conference in Harare last week, Zanu-PF director of indigenisation
and economic empowerment Cde Prosper Masenyama said the failure by banks to
disburse loans on time made it difficult for youths to start their businesses
and contribute to the national economy.

"There are a number of factors occasioned by the disbursing institutions like
the time-lag between application and receipt of funds, cumbersome application
and vetting process and token loan approvals in some cases that have also
impacted on the repayment rates," said Cde Masenyama.

"We thus call on the banks and responsible authorities to interrogate
holistically the issue of non-performing youth loans and take appropriate
remedial action."

Cde Masenyama noted that some youths were failing to pay back their loans due to
challenges in the economy.

"While we acknowledge that some youths are failing to repay the loans, we
believe it is unfair to squarely blame the young people for the non-performance
of the loans," he said.

"We have an economy heavily affected by sanctions making it difficult for youth
-driven businesses and start-ups to operate and compete meaningfully with
established enterprises."

Cde Masenyama urged beneficiaries to repay the loans.

"We advise those youths with operational challenges to approach the relevant
banks and agree to practical repayment plans," he said.

The Youth Development, Indigenisation and Empowerment Ministry set up a
revolving fund through various financial institutions, with Old Mutual
administering the bulk of it to the tune of US$10 million through CABS.

Busia Youths Urged to Take Loans

BYLINE: Gilbert Ochieng

LENGTH: 123 words


YOUTHS in Busia County have been urged to take loans from microfinance
institutions that charge low interest rates.

Uzima Foundation coordinator Fredrick Were said the loans will enable the youth
undertake income generating activities and improve their livelihood.

Addressing a stakeholders' Forum at the Busia Agricultural Training Centre, Were
expressed concerns over the youth's negative attitude towards loans.

He appealed to MFIs in the district to lower interest rates so that the youth in
the county can get affordable loans.

"High interest rates being charged by various MFIs in the country has also
contributed to failure by the youth to apply for loans.

The youths can't improve their living standards without taking loans," Were
said.

Youth Fund Suspension a Big Blow

BYLINE: Kudzai Kuwaza

LENGTH: 676 words


THE suspension of the Youth Development Fund (YDF) by the Central African
Building Society (Cabs) will severely dampen and undermine efforts to curb
unemployment and delinquency among youths, analysts have said.

Cabs MD Kevin Terry told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Youth,
Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment last week that the fund which targets
youths between 18 and 35 years, has underperformed with a 78% default rate.

Cabs, a subsidiary of Old Mutual, is the disbursing agent of the US$10 million
YDF which the parent firm availed as part of its compliance with the
indigenisation and empowerment laws.

Terry said lack of business management skills was the main reason for the high
default rate as most youths were allocated funds without having undergone any
capacity building programmes.

The fund was launched two years ago and had disbursed US$5 million to fund 3 600
projects.

Cabs was not the only financial institution to reveal the shortcomings of the
fund for youths. CBZ Holdings Ltd CEO Never Nyemudzo said the default rate for
its youth facility was 45%.

Defaults were mainly by beneficiaries in the cross border, manufacturing and
poultry business, Nyemudzo revealed.

Indigenisation minister Francis Nhema condemned youths who have defaulted on
loans at a youth seminar in Bulawayo last year.

"All those who have not paid back these loans, we are watching you. What kind of
youths are you, to run away after accessing the loans is not a wise thing to
do," said Nhema at the seminar.

At the same gathering Nhema's deputy Mathias Tongofa told youths that the fund
was not a donation but a bank loan which should be repaid.

In an interview with this paper in May, Tongofa revealed that the ministry was
working with its monitoring and evaluation team to recover debts owed by youths
to the Cabs for empowerment projects.

Economist Godfrey Kanyenze said there was need to review the Doing Business
indicators first before embarking on the funding of youths.

"It is not just a matter of funding away the problems," Kanyenze said. "It is a
structural problem and we need to undertake Doing Business reform. You cannot
have company closures and then help set up tuckshops in the same environment."

He said the high default rate was a damning indictment on the selection process
of the youths to benefit from the fund.

Kanyenze said there was need for proper records of beneficiaries as well as
avoiding being partisan in giving out loans.

He pointed out that one "can't just pick someone from the streets" and give them
funding to start a business.

Kanyenze added that the YDF should be handled by relevant stakeholders and not
involve politicians. He said economic recovery was crucial if the programme to
fund youths is to bear fruit.

He said: "there is no substitute to economic recovery. You cannot deal with
youth challenges before you deal with the constraints of doing business."

Zimbabwe Youth Council executive director Livingstone Dzikira is one of the
stakeholders in the establishment of the YDF .

He said the suspension of YDF is necessary as it would allow them to
"stocktake."

"We have some of our members who sit in the trust and participated in making the
decision (to suspend the fund)," Dzikira told businessdigest on Tuesday. "The
idea was to take stock. We need to restrategise to make the fund grow."

He refused to call the high default rate alarming.

"It is not alarming. Youths have just shown what happens when you do not give
them skills, when you do not monitor them," Dzikira said. "It should be not be
interpreted as failure to do business."

He added that the process of stock taking would be finalised by the end of this
month with the fund back in operation next month.

Dzikira said they are working on models that will not only help them supervise
loans given to youths, but attract other banks to inject money into the fund.

The youth fund was set up to support income generating programmes to help buffer
youths against the country's economic constraints charecterised by a severe
liquidity crunch and high unemployment rate.

Ministry Decries Non-Repayment of Youth Fund Loans

BYLINE: Samuel Otieno

LENGTH: 414 words


THE Government has so far spent over Sh4.5 billion towards reducing unemployment
among the youths, youths and sports minister Paul Otuoma Otuoma has revealed.
The minister said, out of the total funds, Sh99.8 million has been distributed
to youths in Nyanza Province.

However, the minister said, low uptake and defaults was hampering the fund's
efforts towards reducing the gap of unemployment among the youth one of the key
pillars why the kitty was founded. Otuoma said, most of the youth shy away from
taking the money from the youth kitty and those who take do not refund for
others to benefit.

However, youths said, the money given to financial institution was very
difficult to access since they need more stringent measures that some of the
youths do not have. The Minister said the ministry will look into ways of
increasing uptake of the fund. "The main reason why the youth kitty was
initiated is to reduce the rate of unemployment among our youths, it will be
very disastrous if we don't get to that goal and we have the money in the banks
and Kitty lying uncollected", said the minister.

The fund's chief executive, Mwatata Mwangala, however blamed the poor recovery
of loans given out under the Youth Development Enterprise Fund as one of its
stumbling block. Mwangala said the fund should be revolving to allow other youth
to apply for their well being but non-repayment by the first beneficiaries is
putting the funds objective on hold since other cannot access funds.

Mwangala said the recovery has been at its lowest noting that there are many
youth who are eager to apply for the loan to assist them initiate business
oriented developments. He said they have engaged in entrepreneurship training of
the youth to enhance their capacity on enterprise development thus the need for
the loan.

He revealed that the national loan recovery currently stand below 25 percent out
of the total money disbursed to the youths for the four years the programme has
been in place. Mwangala urged stakeholders in the country to assist the
government in sensitizing the youth on the benefits of repaying the loan.

He said that they have started streamlining operations of the fund to assist the
youth in addressing unemployment in the country. He said, there was high
recovery in money disbursed through financial institutions and slow increase of
recovery in money disbursed lately through the kitty but very poor recovery on
the money which were initially disbursed when the programme began.

PM unveils Rs 20bln youth uplift packagePoliticians, businessmen laud PM's
address

SECTION: Vol. V No. 261

LENGTH: 908  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Saturday announced a development package
worth Rs 20 billion for the country's youth comprising six projects,aimed at
providing them assistance mainly through affordable education, soft loans and
skill-based training. The six projects include Micro Interest Free Loans Scheme,
Small Business Loans Scheme, Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development
Scheme, Fee Assistance Scheme and PM's Scheme for Laptops Provision, said Nawaz
Sharif in his televised address to the nation. He aid the government was
committed to the uplift of youth. "I am sure that a self-reliant and prosperous
youth will prove as a vanguard in the nation's journey towards national
integrity, prosperity and sovereignty." Political, business and social circles
have welcomed the speech of Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.

As I have told before, that every year we spend approximately Rupees 500 billion
on the government institutions which are run in losses. These 500 billion, if
available to the government, can be utilized on such financial initiatives, that
could bring a revolution in the lives of underprivileged classes and youngsters.

One of the reasons behind the weakening state institutions is over staffing due
to rampant nepotism and political appointments. Unable to support such a burden,
these institutions have fallen in to rubble. Institutions like PIA, Steel Mills
and Railways are just a few examples of nepotism, favoritism and financial
mismanagement.

It is in the interest of the nation and the state to strengthen private sector,
and to provide the people with opportunities of self reliance. So that instead
of running after jobs, they could stand on their own feet to provide a
livelihood to their families.

For this purpose, the government is launching SIX programmes for the youth.

1- MICRO INTEREST FREE LOANS

The first programme is Micro Interest Free Loans, which will be focused on those
segments of society who are financially weak. 3 billion rupees have been
allocated for this scheme. 250 thousand people will benefit from this scheme.
These loans would be interest free.

2- SMALL BUSINESS LOANS SCHEME

The second scheme is Small Business Loans Scheme. This scheme is for those
educated youngsters, who wish to start their own business. 50 per cent of these
loans will be provided to women. These loans ranging from 500 thousand to 2
million rupees, will be given with a discounted interest rate of 8 percent. The
rest will be paid by the government. Initially these loans will be provided
through the National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank. Five billion rupees
have been allocated for this scheme.

3- YOUTH TRAINING SCHEME

It is the third programme, being initiated by the government for educated
youngsters. Under this programme, young educated people having acquired 16 years
of education from recognized institutions will be provided on-the-job- training,
so that they could get job opportunities in the country or abroad. During the
training a monthly stippned of rupees 10 thousand will be given to the worker
for a training period of 6 months. 4 billion rupees have been allocated for the
purpose and 50 thousand graduates will benefit from the scheme.

4- YOUTH SKILL DEVELOPMENT SCHEME

The youth skill development scheme is aimed at providing vocational training to
such youngsters who are jobless. Boys and girls up to 25 years of age will be
able to benefit from the scheme, who have gained middle level education (8th
Grade). These youngsters will be given a monthly stippned worth 3-5 thousand
rupees, for a period of 6 months. The government will bear their fee. 800
million rupees have been allocated for this programme.

5- FEE PAYMENT FOR UNDER PREVILIGED AREAS

The fifth scheme is for (male & female) students who come from far flung areas
of the country, and want to acquire higher education. Any talented student
should not be deprived of educational opportunities, only because his or her
parents cannot afford the academic expenses. Government will bear the fee for
youngsters aiming for a post graduate programme for MA, MSc or higher level. 1.2
billion rupees have been allocated for this scheme and 30 thousand students will
benefit from this initiative.

6- PM SCHEME FOR PROVISION OF LAPTOPS

This is the age of Information Technology, in the current time, it is impossible
to acquire quality education and research without information technology. IT is
key to access the treasure of knowledge globally available.

The government of Punjab had initiated a laptop scheme for the purpose. The
federal government has decided to launch this scheme nationwide. 100 thousand
students will be provided laptops in accordance with the programme. An amount of
4 billion rupees has been allocated for the PM Laptop scheme.

These schemes will be placed on a special website www.pmo.gov.pk from Monday the
23rd of September. You can  give your feedback on the website  or you can send
an SMS to 80028.

You can also post your suggestions and proposals to the Prime Minister Office
Islamabad.

We want to resolve all issues like energy crisis, loadshedding, health and
education. We want to spend taxpayers money on the development of industries and
trade, for the creation of jobs for the people of Pakistan.

Get ready to benefit from these programmes, I believe that youngsters can play
the main role in steering Pakistan on the path of self reliance. Stand up with
the aim to rewrite your destiny.

BYLINE: Reuben Olita

LENGTH: 207  words


THE government yesterday urged Teso youth to apply for Youth Fund loans. More
than Sh4 million allocated to Amagoro constituency in the last financial year
under the Youth Fund is still unused as the youth shun the loans.

This prompted officials from the fund's national office to convene a one-day
workshop to educate the youth in Teso on the need to apply for the loans.

Teso North DO Richard Ajwang' said it is strange that the youth are declining to
take loans that do not attract any interest yet they are struggling to make ends
meet. "Sh4 million is not small money. I urge you to secure the loans, get right
businesses, repay and obtain others," the DO told more than 150 youth from Teso
North and South at Teso County Council hall.

Ajwang' said white collar jobs are dwindling and challenged the youth to
diversify their careers and venture into self employment. "Kenya has become very
competitive. If you don't measure up to employers' expectations, you will remain
behind economically as the country advances" the DO said.

Teso county council chairman, Moses Ote urged the Youth Fund officials to be
fair when giving out loans to the youth. "Only deserving cases should be
considered, and on a first-come-first service basis," he said.

Alarm over Loan Default Rate

BYLINE: Dave Opiyo

LENGTH: 399  words

DATELINE: Nairobi


Youth and women groups have started defaulting on loans given to start
businesses. The default rate is at about 40 per cent and managers fear that the
revolving funds could dry out soon and deny opportunities to new borrowers.

Managers of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund and the Women Enterprise Fund
say some borrowers had stopped servicing their loans.

"Because this being a revolving fund, failure to pay or any default means that
money that should have been used to lend to other youth groups is unavailable,"
Mr Evans Gor, the director of the Youth Enterprise Development Fund told the
Business Daily, our sister newspaper.

The Youth Enterprise Development Fund has allocated Sh2.5 billion to about 8,500
youth and 71,000 individual enterprises since 2007. Each constituency is
allocated Sh1 million every year in the budget and youth groups can borrow up to
Sh50,000.

Statistics from the ministry of Gender indicates that only about Sh71 million of
the Sh265 million advanced to women's groups since 2007 through the Enterprise
Fund had been repaid.

However, Gender minister Esther Murugi denied that most of their borrowers were
not servicing their debts. She told the Nation that the repayment of loans given
out under the Women's Enterprise Fund was "good", placing it at an impressive 75
per cent.

"It is only in a few cases that we have witnessed default in the repayments of
these loans. This we can attribute to bad politics," she said. Her sentiments
were echoed by Mr Gor, who said that politics had played a key role in
increasing the default rates.

"Politicians tell the borrowers that this is free government money and should
not be repaid. This message came out clearly during the 2007 election
campaigns," he said. Efforts to get comments from Youth Assistant minister
Wavinya Ndeti were fruitless as her phone went unanswered.

The Women Enterprise Fund was established in 2007 to give women affordable loans
and has since been allocated Sh1.8 billion in the budget, with Sh1.4 billion
released to women across the country. Every year, constituencies are allocated
Sh2 million each with women borrowing up to Sh500,000. The loans should be
repaid within 12 months.

Youth groups in Gwasi constituency in Nyanza, Fafi and Ijara constituencies in
North Eastern Province top the list of defaulters. Key loan defaulters for the
Women's Enterprise Fund are mainly from northern Kenya.

East Youth Loan Defaulters Worry State

BYLINE: Julius Phiri

LENGTH: 155 words


Government has expressed disappointment with youths who are defaulting repayment
of Youth Empowerment Fund loans.

Chipata District Commissioner Kalunga Zulu said in Chipata on Friday that he was
disappointed that a number of youths had defaulted the repayment of the loans to
the Government.

Mr Zulu said reminders had been sent to the affected youths but nothing had been
done towards the payment.

"Several attempts have been made to remind the youth over the repayment of the
loan to the Government but surprisingly no youth is willing to make payment," he
said.

Mr Zulu said the non-payment of the loan by the youth was disadvantaging others
who wanted the money.

Meanwhile, the Chipata District Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit has
distributed 50 tonnes of relief food to the needy areas.

Mr Zulu said despite the distribution of the relief maize, some people in the
district were looking for more support to cushion the hunger.

'Low-Interest Loans Answer for Youth Empowerment'

BYLINE: Kennedy Mupeseni

LENGTH: 327 words


PEOPLE'S Process on Housing and Poverty in Zambia (PPHPZ) has said the only way
Zambian youths could be empowered is by providing them with low-interest loans
and entrepreneurial skills.

PPHPZ youth networking officer Chabala Chibelo said his organisation had
embarked on empowering the youth in urban areas with various skills and working
capital, among others. Mr Chibelo said the only solution to the challenges the
youth were facing was to give them training in various skills and working
capital.

"The only way the youths will be empowered is by giving them necessary skills
and working capital for them to embark on various business ventures," Mr Chibelo
said.

He said the organisation was encouraging the youth to venture into agriculture
because it had realised that there was economic potential in the sector. Mr
Chibelo said to date, the organisation had supported youth groups, especially on
the Copperbelt, which are rearing chickens by providing cheaper loans under the
small scheme loan initiative.

The loans were given after the youth formed groups and contribute some money
which enable them qualify for the loans. Mr Chibelo also said his organisation
was supporting the youth by buying pay phones and giving them working capital,
which he said was working well.

He appealed to other stakeholders to partner with his organisation in its quest
to improve the well-being of the youth, especially in the urban parts of the
country. Mr Chibelo further said his organisation was sensitising the youth on
the need to change their mindset towards work.

He said the youth should look at coming up with something that could sustain
their livelihood rather than depending on getting employment alone.

Mr Chibelo called on the Government to implement policies aimed at helping the
youth in the country.

"Government has good policies but the way they are being implemented leaves much
to be desired.

"I hope this time around things will be done differently," he said.

Nawaz launches youth business loans programme

LENGTH: 626  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has launched andamp;#8216;Youth Business
Loans to help young entrepreneurs to initiate their own businesses.
It is designed to provide subsidized financing at eight percent mark-up per
annum for one hundred thousand beneficiaries through National Bank of Pakistan
and First Women Bank.


The total mark up rate would be fifteen percent but the Government would pay the
remaining seven percent on behalf of applicants.
Those falling in the age group of 21 and 45 years are eligible to apply for
loans from one hundred thousand to two million rupees.
Small business loans with tenure up to seven years plus one year grace period
and a debt-equity ratio of 90:10 will be disbursed across the country including
four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas.
SMEDA has been tasked with an advisory role in the implementation of Prime
Ministers scheme.
Nawaz has said he is fulfilling the commitments made with the youth during
election campaign.
Speaking at the launching ceremony, he said it is a big contradiction that loans
worth billions of rupees are doled out to influential and resourceful people but
underprivileged segments of the population are deprived of the opportunities.
The PM said youth in other countries are backbone of their economies and there
is no reason that youth who constitutes sixty percent of our population should
not take us to zenith of progress and development.
Nawaz said in the past nationalization of industries and banks destroyed the
national economy.
He said our previous government denationalised and privatized the banks and now
they are earning billions of rupees and paying taxes to the government. He said
now the present government is going towards privatization of the entities.
Nawaz said it is not job of the government to run factories rather it should
concentrate on improving law and order situation, weeding out terrorism,
addressing sectarianism, and improving image of the country.
The PM said during his recent visit to the United States President Obama and
senior members of his administration repeatedly asked one question as to what
the United States can do to help Pakistan. Mian Nawaz Sharif said he told them
that Pakistan needs more access to your markets and not any financial aid.
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Ministers Youth Business Loans Chairwoman Maryam
Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of the Nawaz Sharifs election
commitments.
She said others only made pledges but the PML-N government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.
Maryam said there are only three conditions for the applicants - they should be
Pakistani, holder of valid computerised national identity card and should have a
guarantor.
She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free.
Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA offices to facilitate
applicants and guide them.
She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans.
The chairwoman said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the loans.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current years budget are practically being implemented.
He said Nawaz abolished his discretionary fund and the government slashed
expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other ministries and divisions
by 30 percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also being slashed to
save 3.5 billion rupees.
He pointed out that Pakistans position improved by twelve points in corruption
index prepared by Transparency International.

PM's Small Business Loan Scheme attracts millions of youth

LENGTH: 725  words


Prime Minister's Small Business Loan Scheme on first day of its commencement
attracted millions of youth, who rushed to the designated bank branches as well
as the SMEDA offices in the city to get the scheme forms on Monday. While, a
large number of unemployed youth used the online facility, as about 1.5 million
individuals downloaded the forms from the SMEDA's (Small and Medium Enterprise
Development Authority) website alone. There was a great deal of rush of young
males and females outside the designated branches of National Bank of Pakistan
(NBP), and The First Women Bank Limited in the provincial capital city.

PM's Small Business Loans Scheme is designed to provide subsidized financing at
8 per cent mark-up per annum for 100,000 beneficiaries.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years and a debt: equity of 90:10
would be disbursed to SME beneficiaries across Pakistan, covering Punjab, Sindh,
KPK, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Youth Programme
encompassing loans for small business, tuition fee, skills development, laptop
scheme, youth training and interest-free loans, is a great initiative for the
youth empowerment what Pakistan needed at present, this was crux of enthusiastic
young men, who talked to reporter in a random survey here.

Since youth is an integral part of Pakistan and the country's bulging youth is
desperate for education and jobs these days, these schemes would not only
increase their confidence in the PML-N government but also enable them to earn
livelihood in a respectable manner, said  M. Nadeem Syed, an intending young
entrepreneur. He said that youth disorientation and disappointment was also one
of the major factors raising the crimes rate, and the PM's Small Business Loan
Scheme would definitely play an effective role in control crimes and elimination
of other social evils.

Another young man outside the NBP, Kamran Hussain Jatt said that the youth must
apply for these vital schemes to become self-sustained in their lives and ensure
their contribution towards the national economy. He, however, urged the
government to increase the funds and scope of the youth programme across
Pakistan, while maintaining strict merit and transparency in the distribution of
loans.

For facilitation of the intended young entrepreneurs, the SMEDA has already
completed 50 fresh pre-feasibility studies for the scheme with an allocated
budget of Rs 5 billion for 2013-14. All of these pre-feasibility studies are
available free of cost on SMEDA website: www.smeda.org.pk
<http://www.smeda.org.pk>.

The SMEDA's pre-feasibility studies covered 15 major and potential business
areas including agri-processing, chemical, construction, dairy and livestock,
energy, fisheries, food, furniture, gems & jewellery, horticulture, leather,
marble, mineral, services and textile.

rose water, honey production, processing, packing and marketing, injection
moulding plastic products, light

weight roof tile manufacturing unit, interior designing and landscaping, goat
fattening farm, sheep fattening farm, calf fattening farm, camel farming, dairy
farm, layer farming, meat shop, poultry farm, veterinary clinic, fodder
production & trading company, UPS & stabiliser assembling unit, inland fish

systematic implementation, its Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said
today.

He said the manual would outline the format to be followed by bodies
involved in organising the Rakan Muda activities to ensure they did not
deviate from the objectives of the programme.

"We have found that States participating in the programme had approached
the activities differently while some had given priority to certain
activities only," he said.

Speaking after opening the Malaysian Youth Council (MBM) annual general
meeting and convention here, he said the introduction of the manual was
necessary to enable organisations nationwide to follow a standard format
when organising Rakan Muda programmes.

Present were MBM president Suhaimi Ibrahim and Negri Sembilan executive
councillor Datuk Lilah Yassin. About 250 participants from 50
organisations are attending the three-day meeting.

Generally, he said, the ministry was satisfied with the implementation
of the programme but more needed to be done to ensure its success in
developing responsible youths of the future.

"We want to make sure activities under the programme are given equal
treatment and priority so that it will attract greater participation by
all youths," he said.

Muhyiddin said the ministry would be organising a workshop session
attended by organisers of the programme soon to enable it to evaluate its
performance since it was implemented eight months ago.

He said the feedback received from participants of the workshop would
enable the ministry to formulate inputs to make the activities more
concrete while enhancing the programme.

Furthermore, he said, there was a need for society and corporate
organisations to participate actively in the programme.

"The programme should not be viewed as only for youths. Society and the
corporate sector can also participate in making it an important agenda for
nation building," he added.

Meanwhile, Muhyiddin said the ministry planned to increase the loan
scheme under its Tabung Ekonomi Belia (youth economic fund) programme to
encourage more youths, especially rural youths, to participate in business
ventures.

He said the ministry planned to provide two types of loans - small
business loans of up to RM10,000 and the entrepreneurial loan of up to
RM50,000.

Under the present scheme launched seven years ago, small business loan
applicants are given a maximum of RM2,000 while entrepreneurial loan
applicants are given a maximum of RM30,000 to start a business.

He said during that period, the ministry had spent RM8 million out of
the RM17 million allocated for the fund.

Muhyiddin said the ministry had given out loans to 1,675 applicants of
which only one-third had paid up.

However, he said, the scheme was suspended last year to enable the
ministry to revise it. The scheme will be continued soon.

He said the present payment system had, among others, resulted in
applicants not being able to settle the loans obtained.

"We feel the existing loans under the programme are inadequate due to
the country's rapid economic development," he said.

Under the revised scheme, he said applicants would be allowed to start
paying the loans after one or two years compared with the current
procedure where they have to start payment after six months.

He said the ministry would draw up guidelines to prevent successful
applicants from not paying the loans given to them.

Muhyiddin said the longer duration given for recipients to start paying
the loans would enable them to make payments without much problems.

He said the ministry had submitted an application to Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim to provide a RM10
million annual allocation for the fund for five years beginning next year.

"Anwar responded positively towards the proposal as it was aimed at
developing more youth entrepreneurs," Muhyiddin added.

From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja

Members of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who have good entrepreneurial
skills can now access N2.5 billion loans provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN).
The loan  is part of the N220 billion set aside for the Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs), which has been lying fallow since it was released in 2012.
Making this known at a flag-off of the training of the first batch of applicants
under the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP)  in Abuja, CBN
Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said that each corps member is entitled to a
maximum of N3 million, adding that their degree certificates and their NYSC
discharge certificates would serve as their collaterals.
He, however, was optimistic that the youths will exhibit the highest level of
probity and responsibility in paying back the loan as no youth would like to toy
with his degree certificate or NYSC discharge  certificate.
"We are very optimistic and that is why we are saying that what is important is
that our youths display the highest level of probity. Character must remain
sound to the extent that they take the loan and they pay the loan. It is very
important that this is emphasised and that is why I am saying that it is not a
grant; it is a loan that must be repaid.
"We are determined to give support to the youths and I truly must thank the NYSC
who has helped us to put together the first set of NYSC, both present and past
ones, so that we can nurture them as young entrepreneurs not as people who go
into the world looking for jobs, but  nurture them as people who are developing
the entrepreneurial spirit, entrepreneurial skills, not only for their good but
also for the good of  the country.
"We do not anticipate that any of them fails. The reason is because Nigeria is
not the only country where SME loans have been granted. It has been successful
in different countries.  In South East Asian economies it has been successful.
Indeed, the  highest rate  of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) that we have seen in
these economies have been a maximum of three per cent. So, what we are saying is
that if we lend money to 100 people, 97 people pay, which is a very commendable
feat and that is what we expect here.
"However,  we have as collateral their NYSC certificate as well as their degree
certificate. We know that our youths know the importance of their degree
certificates as well as  their NYSC certificate as collateral for this loan. I
don't think somebody who has got a degree certificate or HND certificate to
attain a gainful employment or a gainful life will abandon his certificate or
his NYSC discharge certificate just because he wants to take a loan and not pay.
I want to enjoin everyone who has accessed  this loan to please pay," the
governor pleaded.

Earlier, the NYSC Director General, Brigadier General Sule Zakari Kazaure,
thanked CBN for initiating such a training programme for corps members.
According to him, about 1,500 corps members are participating in the
entrepreneurship training, which is taking place simultaneously all over the
country.
In Abuja, he said there are 180 participants; Plateau, 130; Katsina State, 208;
Enugu State,160; Akwa Ibom State, 227; Osun State, 271; Lagos State, 179.
He disclosed that the purpose of the training is to provide skills to  the corps
members  so as to enable them achieve their goals in life. This, he explained,
will help to reduce the unemployment rate in the country.

Pakistan: PM's Small Business Loan Scheme attracts millions of youth

LENGTH: 750  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Dec. 10 -- Prime Minister's Small Business Loan Scheme

on first day of its commencement attracted millions of youth, who

rushed to the designated bank branches as well as the SMEDA offices

in the city to get the scheme forms on Monday.

While, a large number of unemployed youth used the online facility,

as about 1.5 million individuals downloaded the forms from the SMEDA's (Small
and Medium Enterprise Development Authority) website alone.

There was a great deal of rush of young males and females outside

the designated branches of National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), and The

First Women Bank Limited in the provincial capital city.

PM's Small Business Loans Scheme is designed to provide subsidized financing at
8 per cent mark-up per annum for 100,000 beneficiaries.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years and a debt: equity

of 90:10 would be disbursed to SME beneficiaries across Pakistan,

covering Punjab, Sindh, KPK, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad

Jammu & Kashmir and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Youth Programme encompassing loans

for small business, tuition fee, skills development, laptop scheme,

youth training and interest-free loans, is a great initiative for

the youth empowerment what Pakistan needed at present, this was crux

of enthusiastic young men, who talked to media in a random survey here.

Since youth is an integral part of Pakistan and the country's

bulging youth is desperate for education and jobs these days, these

schemes would not only increase their confidence in the PML-N government but
also enable them to earn livelihood in a respectable manner, said

M. Nadeem Syed, an intending young entrepreneur.

He said that youth disorientation and disappointment was also one

of the major factors raising the crimes rate, and the PM's Small Business Loan
Scheme would definitely play an effective role in control crimes

and elimination of other social evils.

Another young man outside the NBP, Kamran Hussain Jatt said that

the youth must apply for these vital schemes to become self-sustained

in their lives and ensure their contribution towards the national economy. He,
however, urged the government to increase the funds and scope of

the youth programme across Pakistan, while maintaining strict merit

and transparency in the distribution of loans.

For facilitation of the intended young entrepreneurs, the SMEDA

has already completed 50 fresh pre-feasibility studies for the scheme

with an allocated budget of Rs 5 billion for 2013-14. All of these
pre-feasibility studies are available free of cost on SMEDA website:
www.smeda.org.pk.

The SMEDA's pre-feasibility studies covered 15 major and potential business
areas including agri-processing, chemical, construction,

dairy and livestock, energy, fisheries, food, furniture, gems &

jewellery, horticulture, leather, marble, mineral, services and

textile.

According to SMEDA, around 50 businesses, which have been developed/transformed
into pre-feasibility studies included seed oil extraction unit (cotton seed),
rose water, honey production, processing, packing and marketing, injection
moulding plastic products, light

weight roof tile manufacturing unit, interior designing and landscaping, goat
fattening farm, sheep fattening farm, calf fattening farm, camel farming, dairy

A federal plan to spend $ 684 million on projects to train and help young people
find jobs was greeted by mixed reaction Friday.

While new initiatives to offer planning, support services and financing to young
entrepreneurs were welcomed, one group dedicated to getting youth off the street
said the idea of a national youth service corps is dated.

"The problem is that the bureaucrats are so out of touch with the clientele that
they'll create a program and say, 'Here's the program guys, now jump on board',"
said Carl DeLine, director of The Back Door, a local youth employment society.

The service corps is open to unemployed youth aged 18 to 24. Participants will
work in community projects such as reforestation, health and child care, and
safety and crime prevention.

DeLine said it's fine for the Liberals to talk about providing six-month social
and community work projects for 2,500 youth, but they're failing to realize that
many of the young people in greatest need won't have the "pre-entry" skills to
qualify.

The local Canada Employment Centres for Students wouldn't comment on how the
plan will affect Calgary before receiving more details.

Human Resources Minister Lloyd Axworthy also announced plans for an internship
project that will involve 8,500 youths this year in learn-as-you-work programs,
with an emphasis on technical/vocational areas. The plan is to train 60,000
youths over three years.

There will also be more money spent for student summer jobs and student loans,
Axworthy said, adding that he's paying for the projects with money already
assigned to his department by streamlining inefficient programs and eliminating
others.

The summer job program will allocate almost $ 120 million to cover 60,000 jobs,
a 20-per-cent increase from last year. Ceilings on student loans will be raised
by up to 40 per cent to $ 5,610 a year. Axworthy expects 280,000 students to
take part in the $ 479-million program.

But University of Calgary students' union president Naheed Nenshi said while
students are pleased the government is tackling youth unemployment, the changes
are a Band-Aid solution.

"The Canada student loan program serves the needs of students 30 years ago," he
said. "We really need to rework the entire system. They're fixing the plumbing
when it really needs to be replaced."

University students also say they weren't consulted about the changes, and are
worried about the increasing influence of banks through loan risk-sharing
agreements.

"Neither the province nor the federal government seem to understand by giving
more power to the banks, you're ensuring bank profit at the expense of taxpayers
and students," Nenshi said.

In Alberta, the provincial government has said giving the loan system over to
the banks will save the province millions in default costs.

More than 23 per cent of students defaulted on their loans this year, costing
provincial taxpayers $ 15.3 million - up from 22 per cent and $ 12.3 million in
1992-93.

Advanced Education Minister Jack Ady believes banks will provide good service
because they see students as potential longtime customers after they finish
school.

However, another U of C group, the local chapter of the Association of
Collegiate Entrepreneurs, was pleased with at least one component of the federal
plan.

In addition to expanding services for young entrepreneurs, the government is
pumping $ 1.1 million into interest-free loans of up to $ 3,000 to students
interested in running their own summer businesses.

"That's a big boost to young entrepreneurs seeking financing," said chapter
president Steve Kamajian. "It shows that the government is recognizing this
activity as legitimate."

He said the federal money is a nice compliment to the $ 3,000 loans already
available to provincial entrepreneurs through the Alberta Opportunity Company.

Meanwhile, both the Reform party and Bloc Quebecois lashed out at the government
plan Friday, the former claiming it's a recycled version of former programs that
didn't work, and the latter saying the apprenticeship portions encroach on
provincial jurisdiction.

Reform MP Monte Solberg said the government is giving false hopes to youth
looking for meaningful work. "We feel they're really nibbling around the edges
of the jobless problem."

Youth Groups Servicing Their Loans Well, Says CEO

BYLINE: Ramadhan Rajab

LENGTH: 434 words


THE youth enterprise fund has disbursed over Sh5.2 billion loans to young people
in the country since its inception, a fund's report states. The loans were
advanced to over 144,000 youth enterprises with 80 to 90 per cent enterprises
confirmed to have serviced their loans.

Out of the total money disbursed Sh545.3 million was given to 12,407 group
projects, and Sh54.2 million to 2,111 individual enterprises at the constituency
level. Through financial intermediaries the report reveals the fund has financed
129, 385 group and individual enterprises to the tune of Sh4.6 billion.

"The fund has further trained over 200,000 youth in entrepreneurship and
assisted 1,800 to market their products and services. A further 6,000 youths
have been facilitated to obtain employment abroad," the funds status report as
at September 30, 2011 reads in part.

According to Juma Mwangale the funds CEO said because the fund is revolving the
cumulative amount advanced as loans is more than what fund has received from
Treasury. This financial year Treasury gave the fund Sh550 million making the
total allocation from Treasury since 2006 to Sh3.3 billion.

Mwangale also dismissed fears that rising lending rates may discourage uptake of
the youth funds loans, saying the lending rates had been fixed on a flat rate of
5 per cent of those got from constituency committees, and those seeking loans
through banks attracts an 8 per cent interest rate.

"We have not reviewed our lending rate and we don't intend to revise it any time
soon, the flat rate is meant to shield the Kenya youths from vagaries of
economic trends," he said as the local banks were pegging their interest rates
between 20 and 30 per cent in the wake of falling shilling value against the
dollar. The status report also showed 90 per cent appropriate utilisation of the
money with attestation that those who took loans are still in business.

However there notable regional disparities in loan uptake, with Western, Nyanza,
parts of Rift Valley and North Eastern regions recording low uptake. "These
disparities may be attributed to population sizes, entrepreneurial readiness of
the population, financial infrastructure, levels of economic activity, and
entrepreneurial opportunity," Youths minister Paul Otuoma said during the launch
of the report.

Among the measures the ministry is taking Otuoma said were training
entrepreneurs to increase upkeep, introduction of sector specific products,
enhanced sensitization and stakeholder engagement. "Indeed we have launched
county stakeholder forums to help identify the unique needs of each region," he
said.

Govt urged to simplify loan scheme process

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 281

LENGTH: 677  words


While appreciating business loan scheme for youth, a number of youth seeking
support from Prime Minister Loan Scheme Sunday demanded of the government to
make procedure and criteria simple of the scheme to enable a large number of
people to take benefit from it.

The programme has broad canvas of schemes enabling youth and poor segments of
population to get good opportunities of employment, economic empowerment,
acquiring skills needed for gainful employment, spreading use of computers and
imparting on-the-job training for young graduates to improve the probability of
getting a productive job.

Under the Prime Minister's Youth Programme, a loan ranging from Rs 0.1 million
to Rs 2 million has been offered to youth with age from 21 years to 45 years at
the mark-up rate of 8 per cent. The loan would be recovered in a period of eight
years in equal monthly instalments.

The fund would be disbursed among the youth on soft terms and conditions and
instead of employees it would help turn make them employers. The youth are
jubilant and taking keen interest in the scheme and the visiting of the large
number of youth for seeking information is ample proof of that tremendous
response. Dozens of youth have been witnessed visiting the special desk
established in the Regional Office, Small & Medium Enterprise Development
Authority (Smeda).

Talking to this scribe, a youth Mohammad Imran appreciated the scheme for
empowering the youth. However, he called for the creation of awareness in the
people and further softening of the terms and conditions of the scheme.

He complained that the criterion of the scheme is not clear that who can take
benefit from the scheme while the residents of the far-flung areas are totally
ignorant of it. He urged the government for the devolution of the scheme from
provincial level to district level and removal of the doubts among youth.

Ahmad Gul, another youth, said that he is anxiously desirous for taking benefit
of the scheme but he has no gazetted officer in his family. He said that due to
such difficult terms and conditions potential youth would failed in taking
benefit from the scheme. He also stressed need for the softening of the
criterion to enable the youth of poor and middle class families to take benefit
of it.

A young woman entrepreneur also complained of the strict terms and conditions
for the guarantors in the scheme. She said that as compared to men, women would
face more difficulties in finding guarantors for obtaining the loan from the
scheme.

Meanwhile, tribal elders, politicians and traders have welcomed extending Youth
Business loan programme to Fata and said that it would not only curb
unemployment among the youths but it will also help eliminate trend of militancy
and extremism in the entire tribal areas.

Talking to reporters, the tribal elders and political leaders, including senior
leader of PML-N and MNA Shahabuddin Khan, Senator Hidayatullah Khan, PML-N
Bajaur President Haji Rahat yousaf, Dr Mohammad Gull pechawal, Malik Mohammad
Yar Khan, Malik Abdul Aziz Khan and Abdul Manan Janbaz, lauded the Prime
Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif for extended the youth business programme to the
tribal areas.

They said expansion of youth business programme to the tribal areas was the
right way to provide opportunity to the tribesmen for showing their talent and
ability for the economic development of the area. They said the programme would
not only help the youth of the tribal areas start their own business but it will
also boost the socio-economic condition of the region.

They said that the launching of youth business programme showed that the Prime
Minister was devoted to fulfil his election commitments. The elders said that
the expansion of youth business programme to Fata would not only curb the
unemployment among the youths but it will also help eliminate militancy and
extremism in tribal areas.

The elders also demanded of the Prime Minister to launch special development
programme for the tribal areas because the areas had been affected by the
militancy and war on terrorism.

satisfactory evaluation of borrower's business feasibility by bank. Similarly,
under PM's Interest Free Loan Scheme more than 250,000 interest free loans
amounting to Rs. 5.6 billion have been awarded to poorest of the poor in 427
Union Councils of 44 districts across Pakistan. Around 62 per cent of loan
beneficiaries are female, and recovery rate of scheme is 99 per cent, she said
in an exclusive interview with media.

Leila Khan shared statistics of youth schemes under the programme which she
termed as a remarkable initiative of the PML-N government for socio-economic
development of youth in a bid to combat soaring unemployment in the country.

She said this programme has broad canvas of schemes enabling youth and poor
segments of population to get good opportunities of employment, economic
empowerment, acquiring skills needed for gainful employment, access to IT and
imparting on-the-job training for young graduates to improve probability of
getting a productive job.

Leila Khan said Prime Minister's Youth Programme includes six schemes - PM's
Youth Business Loan Scheme, PM's Interest Free Loan Scheme, PM's Youth Skill
Development Programme, PM's (National) Programme for Provision of Laptops to
Talented Students, PM's Fee Reimbursement Scheme for Less Developed Areas, and
PM's Youth Training Scheme.

She said PM's Youth Skill Development Scheme has so far trained 75,000 youth
both male and female in more than 100 demand-driven traded across Pakistan as
per NFC award quotas. Training classes of another 25,000 trainees under Phase
III (Batch- II) has commenced on January 2, 2017.

The chairperson said 33 percent of total training slots are reserved for female
trainees. Madaris graduates and disabled youth are also catered to under this
scheme.

She said under PM's (National) Programme for Provision of Laptops to Talented
Students Phase-I & II, so far more than 182,000 laptops have been distributed

Commission (HEC) recognized universities across Pakistan. The distribution of
remaining 17,000 to 18,000 laptops will be completed by January 15. Moreover,
the process of delivery of laptops to universities under Phase-III of the scheme
has been initiated, and HEC has planned to distribute another 100,000 laptops
among eligible university students by March. The HEC has also initiated

manufacturing industry, and contribute significantly in country's GDP, first
time in the history of Pakistan, MS Haier Pakistan, the vendor of the scheme,
has set up a state-of-the-art Laptop Assembly Plant under the scheme. The
initial capacity of staff is about 60 at the plant which will be increased
gradually. Around 150,000/200,000 laptops have been assembled locally at the
above plant.

She said under PM's Fee Reimbursement Scheme, so far tuition fee of almost
150,000 students of less developed areas across Pakistan has been
reimbursed/paid upfront. Due to this valuable intervention, 100 per cent
enrollment has been witnessed in some universities of Balochistan.

Moreover, she said under Phase-I of PM's Youth Training Scheme, around 44,000
fresh graduates, degree/diploma holders, have been granted 12-month paid
internship @ Rs. 12000/month based on their matching demand in reputed public

Youths scupper loan scheme

BYLINE: Edgar Gweshe

LENGTH: 259  words


Youths linked to senior Zanu (PF) politicians are using their connections to
avoid repaying loans they were given under the Old Mutual Youth Empowerment
Fund.

The Zimbabwe Youth Council Director, Livingstone Dzikira, told The Zimbabwean
that they were battling to recover the money lent to the youths. Some had even
changed their contact details in a bid to evade repaying the loans. $5 million
is still outstanding. In 2011, Old Mutual made available $11 million for youth
empowerment projects. The fund is being administered by the Central African
Building Society (CABS).

"We are having a torrid time tracking down some of the youths who have not
repaid the loans. Some are boasting of political connections saying that they
are untouchable," said Dzikira. In 2012, it was found that 70 percent of youths
who had benefited from the empowerment fund had diverted the money away from the
projects it was intended to fund. Some used it to pay lobola.

Dzikira vowed that they would track down the defaulters, saying it was
unacceptable that youths would use political muscle to avoid repaying a loan. He
said the abuse of political links by the youths went against the spirit of
empowerment.

"We are saying that there is no need for them to go into hiding or try to use
unorthodox means to avoid repaying the loans. They should come forward and
explain their situation to us. It is not a crime for one to fail to repay, but
of major concern is the fact that we have some who are running away or want to
use some form of cover to avoid repaying the loans," he said.

Finance Division asks FBR to exempt youth loans from three percent WHT

SECTION: Vol. 52 No. 276

LENGTH: 468  words


The Finance Division has asked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to exempt
financing to unemployed youth under the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
(PMYBL) Scheme from payment of 3 percent withholding tax under section 231 B(1A)
of Income Tax Ordinance 2001. Sources told Business Recorder on Wednesday that
the Finance Division has approached the FBR regarding exemption of section
231B(1A) of Finance Bill 2016-17 for financing under PMYBL scheme.

According to the Finance Division, Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans (PMYBL)
Scheme was launched by the Prime Minister in December 2013 with the prime
objective of providing subsidised loans to unemployed youth aged between 21 and
45 years for establishing or extending business enterprises. Terms and
conditions of the scheme are annexed. A new Section 231B (1A) has been inserted
in the Finance Bill, 2016-17which reads as under:-

"Every leasing company or a scheduled bank or an investment bank or a
development finance institution or a Modaraba shall, at the time of leasing of a
motor vehicle to a non-filer, collect advance tax at the rate of three per cent
of the value of the motor vehicle." Executing Agencies (EAs) of Prime Minister's
Youth Business Loan (PMYBL) Scheme offering loans for purchase of light
commercial vehicles (LCVs) have requested for the exemption from Section
231B(1A) for financing under PMYBL Scheme in view of the following:

PMYBL Scheme was launched by the Prime Minister under which subsidised loans are
creation of self employed youth for setting up of small businesses. Thus, the
scheme supports creation of self employment opportunities for youth and also
plays a role in government's efforts for reducing unemployment level in the
country. Under PMYBL, applicants are required to arrange 10 percent equity
either in the form of cash or movable property. In case of LCV financing, PMYBL
borrowers deposit 10 percent equity in cash, which as per EAs is arranged by the
applicants with great difficulty by borrowing through family and friends.

According to EAs, most of the unemployed youth applying for loans under PMYBL
are non-filers. Hence, burdening them with additional cost in the form of 3
percent advance tax under Section 231 B (1A) for getting financing for LCVs will
discourage them for applying under the Scheme. This will serve as an impediment
in smooth and successful implementation of the Scheme.

The State Bank of Pakistan has endorsed the request of the Executing Agencies.
In view of the justifications given by EAs and endorsement thereto by the SBP,
FBR is requested to consider exemption from Section 231B (1A) of Finance Bill
2016-17 for financing under PMYBL Scheme and furnish views/comments in this
regard. An early response in the matter would be highly appreciated, Finance
Division added.

       She said PM's Youth Skill Development Scheme has so far

 Moreover, the process of delivery of laptops to universities under Phase-III of
the scheme has been initiated, and HEC has planned to distribute another 100,000

        The HEC has also initiated procurement process for Phase-IV of
 the scheme simultaneously.
 It is worth mentioning that under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
component of Youth Laptop Scheme Phase-I, HEC has established e-class rooms and
laundry facilities at IBA Sukkur and COMSATS Islamabad.
       Leila Khan said in order to promote IT manufacturing
 industry, and contribute significantly in country's GDP, first time
 in the history of Pakistan, MS Haier Pakistan, the vendor of the

Youth in twin cities hail Prime Minister's incentives

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 262

LENGTH: 403  words


Youth in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have hailed the
announcement of various schemes by Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's for
the welfare of country's youth.

Soon after Prime Minister's speech to the nation, they said that the provision
of loans to the youth would engage them in entrepreneurship and give boost to
economic activities.

"Pakistan is witnessing a youth bulge and allocation of loans will help them
involve in entrepreneurship. This besides harnessing their potential will lead
to higher productivity and fast economic growth of the country," said Iram, a
student of M.Phil Economics at Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi.

She was optimistic that the incentives such as provision of interest free loans,
small business loans, youth training scheme and youth skilled development scheme
would encourage small business that would help better growth of SMEs in the
country.

She said that the allocation of 50 per cent loans for the women in small
business loan scheme was commendable as the women would now be in a position to
start their own business and contribute in the nation building.

Masood Azeem, a student of MBA Agriculture in the same university said that the
country was passing through a phase of slow economic growth and engaging youth
in business activity would accelerate the pace of economic development.

"It is not possible for government to provide jobs to all youngsters and the
government's decision to focus on youth entrepreneurship development is the best
solution to reduce unemployment," he said.

Aabid Mumtaz, a student of a commerce college in Islamabad said that the steps
announced by the Prime Minister would boost economic activity, create new jobs
and improve tax revenue of the government.

He said realizing the importance of SMEs for economic development, the developed
nations had adopted various policies and established institutions to facilitate
small businesses adding that the youth development scheme announced by the PM
was first step towards that direction.

Shakeel Ahmed, a 23-year-old mechanic at an auto workshop in Islamabad was happy
that now he could apply for a loan under youth skilled development scheme to run
his own business. "For the last two years I have been planning to start my own
business but was not in a position to do that due to my financial problems. Now
I think my dream to have my own business will be materialized," he said.

Host of loan-programs aimed at reducing youth unemployment

LENGTH: 701 words

DATELINE: Nepal


Nepal, May 9 -- The government Sunday introduced a host of concessional and
easy-to-access loan schemes aimed at giving the unemployed youth a leg up by
helping them start businesses as well as pursue higher education and vocational
training.

Unveiling its Policies and Programs for Fiscal Year 2016/17, the government said
the loans would be provided against academic certificates.

However, Sunday's ann-ouncement did not explain who would provide the loans, how
they would be financed and who would bear the risk arising from possible
defaults.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP LOANS

The, it Sunday's announcement, said unemployed youths would be provided
concessional loans on the strength of their project proposals. Such loans would
be easy-to-access and be extended by accepting the applicants' academic
certificates as loan guarantees.

While the bank and financial institutions (BFIs) require some sort of comparable
collateral -- usually fixed assets -- to be put up before sanctioning any loan,
the government's new program aims to give loans to unemployed youth upon
pledging just their academic certificates as the loan guarantee.

Also, before going forward with the loan process, BFIs have to be convinced
about the capacity of the applicant -- their qualification, experience, staff
and partners, among others -- to implement their project as well as whether the
project itself is doable. But government's announcement has not explained if all
this will be a part of the process when it says loans will be handed 'based on
the project proposal'.

Bankers say that floating loans just on the basis of the project proposal and
academic certificate by the BFIs is a bit risky.

"BFIs extend loans based on the viability of a project. It might be risky
providing loans to the unemployed youths without considering this. In some
countries BFIs do provide loans to the youth based on their proposals.

However, the tendency of not repaying loans is rampant here in Nepal," Bhuvan
Dahal, CEO of Sanima Bank Ltd, says. "What happens to the banks' money if the
borrowers do not repay the loans as they have not put up any collateral? Such
projects can be financed by venture capitals or any other funds created by the
government," he said.

Similarly, the government has also announced that it will provide interest-free
educational loans to students for acquiring higher education in scientific,
technical and employment-oriented vocational areas based on educational
certificate.

The policy and programs, however, does not make it clear whether all the youth
-targeted loans announced Sunday will be provided by the government through
refinancing or through subsidies.

INFRASTRUCTURE BANK

The government has reiterated its commitment to open an infrastructure bank in
order to finance larger infrastructure projects.

While the proposed bank has been featuring in policies and programs of the last
few years, the establishment of such a bank is yet to materialize. The
government has also provisioned such bank through an amendment to the Bank and
Financial Institution Act.

LOANS FOR FARMERS

According to the policy and program unveiled Sunday, farmers will be provided
concessional loans under livestock development programs for employment and
income generation.

Last fiscal year, the government had introduced six-percent-subsidy loans to
those involved or looking to get into farming and other agriculture-related
businesses.

"Financial means and resources will be mobilized in agriculture, energy, tourism
and physical infrastructure sectors," read the policy and program, highlighting
the government's priority.

BANK ACCOUNTS FOR ALL

Akin to last year's 'one-household-one bank account' campaign, the current
policy and program stated that a provision would be made for all Nepalis to have
bank accounts.

The government, in its policy and program, also expressed commitment to develop
a 'modern and reliable capital market to attract national and international
savings and investment and important mechanism of country's economic
development'.

Silatech, Ibdaa Lebanon support entrepreneurs

LENGTH: 480  words


11:45 PM 4 September 2015


Qatar-based Silatech and Ibdaa Lebanon have announced the launch of two new loan
products specially developed to help young entrepreneurs start and expand
businesses in Lebanon.
Expected to create over 2,000 additional employment opportunities for Lebanese
youth over a three-year period, both loans will be phased in gradually at six
Ibdaa branches.


While Silatech is a regional social initiative that works to create jobs and
expand economic opportunities for young Arabs, Ibdaa is a leading Lebanese
microfinance institution.
Through the Mashroui (My Project) loan product, Silatech and Ibdaa will provide
an early-phase loan to help young entrepreneurs finance their startup
businesses. The Shabab (Youth) micro loan product is designed to help finance
the expansion of already-existing businesses. Both products target
18-35-year-old Lebanese entrepreneurs who have businesses in operation for less
than six months.
The launch of Mashroui and Shabab follows the signing of an agreement (in April)
between Silatech and Ibdaa Lebanon to jointly finance a Youth Loan Fund and
collaborate on financial and non-financial products and services for Lebanese
youth.
In addition to providing loan capital through Shabab and Mashroui, Silatech and
Ibdaa are delivering enterprise training and financial literacy education to
help young entrepreneurs sustain and grow their businesses.
Earlier in 2015, Silatech conducted a two-day "training of trainers" workshop
for Ibdaa Lebanon credit officers, outlining effective communication and
marketing techniques for Ibdaa to attract younger clients, as well as relevant
criteria to consider when assessing risk among prospective youth clients.
Access to finance is a major stumbling block for young, would-be entrepreneurs
in the Arab world. According to the World Bank, young people in the Middle East
and North Africa region have the world's lowest levels of financial access. The
region also has the world's highest rate of youth unemployment, topping 30% in
2015.
While lower than the regional average, Lebanon's youth unemployment rate of 21%
is still markedly higher than the global average of 13%.
Silatech acting CEO Mohamed al-Naimi said, "Specially-designed loan products
such as Mashroui and Shabab provide much-needed access to new financing and
business support services for young entrepreneurs who are important job creators
of the future, while also opening profitable new markets for financial
institutions." "The Youth Loan Fund will aim at answering the needs of both
existing business owners through the Shabab loan and startups through the
Mashroui loan," said Bachar Kouwatly, CEO of Ibdaa Lebanon, adding that the
partnership with Silatech is part of a global youth-focused co-operation between
Silatech and the Arab Gulf Fund for Development's affiliates in the region.

Loan shark runners are getting younger;
Some seduced into making an easy buck, others paying off their debts

BYLINE: Teh Joo Lin & Ben Nadarajan

LENGTH: 878 words


IF THE 'O$P$' scrawls on the walls look more childish nowadays, it may be
because they are the handiwork of loan shark runners barely out of their teens.

Those caught harassing debtors to pay up seem to be getting younger, with at
least one as young as 12.

Police nabbed 63 youth last year for doing the dirty work for loan sharks when
debtors default on repayment. In 2007, 59 youth were arrested.

Police did not release figures for this year, but The Straits Times did its own
count based on police releases. Of 124 loan sharks and runners arrested, 31 - or
one in four - were aged 19 and below. The youngest was a 12-year-old boy caught
last month as part of a group of five youth who were harassing debtors in Bedok
and Ang Mo Kio.

Rather surprisingly, there were seven girls among the young people arrested.

In May, four girls aged 15 and 16 were caught in the act with the help of a
Hougang resident. Two of them were spotted at a corridor armed with a blue
marker and bags of paint. The girls fled but were pursued by the resident and
his father, who caught one of them at the void deck of a nearby block. The other
three were later arrested by the police.

The cases have led the police to warn youngsters against being made used of by
loan sharks.

A police spokesman said many young people were referred by friends to work for
these syndicates for a quick buck.

Youth recruitment reflects the changing modus operandi of loan shark syndicates,
according to those familiar with their operations.

To reduce the risk of getting busted, syndicate members are staying behind the
scenes, preferring to hire runners to harass debtors for small fees.

Those taken on board have included debtors unable to pay off their loans,
foreign workers and youth who know too little to yield any leads about the
masterminds if they are nabbed.

A loan shark said he used youth because they are more daring. Harassment is a
ready outlet for them to vent their teenage angst and pent-up frustrations.

But since they can get out of hand, these youngsters are often 'teamed' with
older runners who guide them along, he added.

Counsellors such as Ain Society's Mohd Yusof Ismail, who has counselled a few
such youth, compared it to when youth were used to hawk pirated VCDs in public.
'But these kids don't realise what they're getting into and they're biting off
more than they can chew.'

The police have been clamping down hard on loan shark activities, with harsher
penalties added in late 2005.

But the youth, lured by what they see as easy money for deceptively simple work,
seldom think that far, said counsellors. They can get paid about $50 per job by
just splashing paint on doors and scribbling threatening notes on walls.

Lawyer Amolat Singh recently handled a case involving a 17-year-old boy who was
promised $100 for delivering a letter at 2am to a debtor. But he never got to
pick up his pay because he was caught. He is now under probation.

In addition to vandalism, youth have also been known to lock gates with bicycle
chains and smash flowerpots and windows before running away.

A teenage boy and girl, among four youth caught in June, allegedly even set fire
to items outside units in Hougang, Woodlands and West Coast.

Interviews with some youth revealed two ways in which they fall in with loan
sharks: while they are trying to secure loans and when they join gangs.

A 17-year-old boy said a friend introduced him to an 'Ah Long' at a Geylang
coffee shop when he had to pay off $800 in soccer-betting debts.

He was offered a job on the spot: Work for the syndicate rather than borrow
money and be saddled with a 20 per cent interest rate. He would earn $800
upfront for 20 assignments. 'I thought this would be much better than owing them
because what if I can't pay and they beat me?'

Now midway through his 'bond', he said his first job at a Lengkok Bahru flat was
'quite easy'. All he did was shout loudly, bang on the door and ring the
doorbell for 10 minutes, with two 'seniors' look-outs. He said he has pushed
debtors around but never beaten anyone.

Mr Yusof reckons these youth are being exploited. 'They've to continue working
until they pay off their loan or until they are caught. That's why they are
being exploited.'

While some youth are hired while trying to borrow money, others are told to
become runners after they join gangs.

New gang members find it hard to turn down assignments as they feel the need to
prove their allegiance. 'It isn't a must, but they 'bully' new people into doing
it,' said a source close to such gangs.

While they are supposed to just knock on doors, deliver warnings and spray on
walls, they may do 'additionals' on their own such as smashing flowerpots.

If the debtor pays up, the youth get a cut of between 3 per cent and 5 per cent
of the debt, which is typically about $2,000.But over time, many runners drop
out of the job after it dawns on them that the risks outweigh the spoils.

Apart from the fear of being caught by the police, some find themselves getting
beaten up by irritated debtors, who can turn out to be gangsters themselves.

The source said: 'A friend got bashed up and was bleeding all over. They're
afraid of getting beaten up because if they have to go to the hospital, the
police will know.'

Youth Fund Favours Agric Sector

BYLINE: Tawanda Musarurwa

LENGTH: 353 words


THE agricultural sector received the largest allocation of funds under the Youth
Development Fund. In a joint statement, the Ministry of Youth Development,
Indigenisation and Empowerment and CABS said agriculture received the highest
percentage of the grant at 34 percent. Distribution took 31 percent,
manufacturing 23 percent, service 11 percent and mining 1 percent.

The YDF partners said to date 866 individuals had benefited from the fund.

CABS and the Ministry of Youth Development, Indigenisation and Empowerment had
so far approved loans amounting US$1,7 million.

"As at 28 September 2012 we have approved a combined total of US$1 709 620,"
reads part of the statement.

According to the ministry, the funds are distributed in tranches of a minimum of
US$500 up to a maximum of US$5 000, depending on the size and type of project.

The youth empowerment facility provides funds for capital expenditure loans and
project finance, and working capital finance, including short-term loans, debt
factoring, order finance, invoice discounting and guarantees.

The funds are essentially bank loans at an annual interest rate of 10 percent
and are repaid as per loan disbursement agreement.

With the formal employment rate standing at lower than 20 percent of the total
population, the funds are critical in creating opportunities and reducing
poverty among the youths.

The Ministry of Youth Development, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment has
been distributing the funds to youth since 2009 as part of the Government's
empowerment programme with each beneficiary getting a minimum of US$1 000 up to
a maximum of US$5 000 depending on the size and type of their project.

Recently 45 youths from Mbire District, Mashonaland Central Province --
representing 45 different youth-led projects -- recently received funding from
the CABS Kurera/Ukondla Youth Fund.

The youths who are largely into agriculture and the distribution sectors
recently signed their loan offer letters to the tune of over US$40 000.

Other youths that have also benefited from the fund are in Nyanga District,
Mutare, Macheke, Bulawayo Masvingo, Hwange and Gweru.

Monitor Disbursement of Youth Development Loans [analysis]

LENGTH: 365 words


The cost of loans has increased in part due to Central Bank of Kenya's decision
to raise its key lending rate.

Although the move is meant to stabilise the shilling, it will most likely reduce
uptake of loans.

That is why the decision by the Sports and Youth Affairs Ministry to maintain
the interest rates it charges youth groups and young entrepreneurs for its loans
is welcome since the government is primarily not in the lending market to make
money but to improve the welfare.

Loans given under the Youth Enterprise Development Fund have been attracting a
concessionary interest of between five and eight per cent at a time the average
for regular loans is more than 20 per cent.

By maintaining the friendly rates, the ministry will not only encourage young
borrowers to take up loans to start small businesses but, more importantly,
ensure that defaulters are few and far between.

It is, therefore, important for various players -- including the ministry, its
partner banks and youth organisations -- to spread the information to potential
borrowers to create demand. Unless this is done, there is a danger that
misinformation could keep the youth from borrowing.

Over the years, Kenyans have generally been afraid of borrowing for fear that
they might lose their investments and family property if they defaulted. But
when the interest is affordable then it would be advisable for organisations
involved in empowering the youth, especially in rural areas and poor urban
neighbourhoods, to be encouraged to take up the loans and invest either as
individuals or as groups.

The government would be well-advised to keep a close eye on the banks disbursing
the money to ensure that they do not exploit the ignorance of youthful
borrowers. There is a need to check against either abuse of the loan terms or
hoarding of the money even when there is demand. A system to report anomalies or
lodge complaints should also be in place.

The organisations need to bear in mind that even as they insist on compliance
with the rules for disbursement of the money, they do not lose sight of the fact
that the overriding goal of the fund is to help young people create jobs as one
way to keep them away from crime.

Silatech and Vitas Lebanon launch loans for businesses run by youths

LENGTH: 554  words


11:58 PM 11 September 2015


Qatar-based regional social initiative Silatech and Lebanese microfinance
company Vitas Lebanon have launched a new initiative designed to help finance
youth-run businesses.
The initiative includes the introduction of a new dedicated youth startup loan
product called Taasis as well as an outreach effort to finance more existing
youth enterprises.


It is expected to create or sustain 2,400 youth jobs over a three-year period.

The Taasis (founding or establishment) loan provides young entrepreneurs with
loans averaging $5,000 for financing for their startup businesses. In addition,
Vitas Lebanon will seek to provide existing youth enterprises with loans
averaging $2,000 to finance their expansion.
In parallel with providing financing, Vitas - with the support of Silatech -
will provide business skills training to the youth and launch a business plan
competition to raise awareness of entrepreneurship and generate successful
business ideas, which they can then finance.
In June, Silatech conducted a two-day "training of trainers" workshop in Beirut
for Vitas Lebanon credit officers, outlining approaches and communication
techniques for effectively targeting youth clients, and advising on more
accurate and relevant criteria to use when screening loan applicants.
At 30%, unemployment among young Arab men and women is the highest in the world.
Youth unemployment in Lebanon is somewhat lower, at 21%, though still markedly
higher than the global average of 13%.
Silatech's support to Vitas Lebanon is part of a broader programme across the
region, which includes the design and launch of youth-friendly financial
products with microfinance institutions (MFIs) in multiple countries.
2015 will see new youth-focused products and initiatives launched by MFIs in
Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Tunisia, Sudan and Morocco.
Two examples of these are MicroCred Tunisia, which recently launched Irada,
while Jordan's Tamweelcom announced Amal Al Shabab, both in partnership with
Silatech and designed especially for young startup entrepreneurs.
These products are designed to help youth create jobs not only for themselves,
but also for other youth as their businesses succeed and grow.
Silatech works to expand access to finance for young Arab entrepreneurs, working
with banks and financial institutions throughout the region to develop youth
-friendly loan products and business support services.
Innovative financial institutions such as Vitas stand to gain from targeting the
youth enterprise market, as younger clients can offer substantial lifetime value
and institutions can gain significant positive visibility by implementing
meaningful solutions in the fight against youth unemployment.

Mohamed al-Naimi, acting CEO of Silatech, said: "Working with established and
experienced partners such as Vitas Lebanon is essential in order to understand
the needs of young people and design interventions that enable them to start and
grow businesses that create jobs for themselves and others.
Ziad Halaby, general manager of Vitas Lebanon, added: "This co-operation between
Vitas and Silatech comes at a critical time, as Lebanon's unemployment rate has
been increasing drastically over the past couple of years."

 business feasibility plans.
       It is worth-mentioning that Meezan Bank, Al-Baraka Bank, Dubai

PPP MPA moves court against youth festival

LENGTH: 406  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


PPP MPA Shaukat Basra has filed a petition in the Lahore High Court against the
Punjab government accusing it of making fake records of Guinness Book of World
Records during the ongoing Punjab Youth Festival.



Basra in his petition submitted that the Punjab government claimed various
records during the ongoing youth festival contrary to the facts.

He said this act of the government brought bad name to Pakistan all over the
world and on the other hand, national exchequer was also wasted. He said as
claimed by the government, there was no contract between the administration of
the Guinness Book and the government and none of their representatives reached
here to observe the activities.

He said he would prove this in the court that this was all 'fraud'. He said the
government made fool of thousands of youth of the country.

He prayed the court to direct the government to provide record of the festival
and money spent on these activities. He requested the court to stop the
activities of the festival till disposal of this petition.

PTI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Youth Wing President Ali Bukhari has asked
the Punjab government to give complete audit of billions of rupees spent on the
youth festival and youth loan scheme within 10 days.

He warned if the government did not make public the complete audit record of
those two projects, court would be moved.

Addressing a press conference at PTI Punjab Secretariat with PTI Punjab
office-bearers on Friday, Bukhari alleged that the Punjab government had been
deceiving the masses in the name of youth festival and youth loan scheme,
swindling billions of rupees from the public exchequer.

He said Guinness World Records had exposed the big lies told in the name of
creating world records in Punjab youth festival.

He said none of the loans approved under youth loan scheme were paid to the
youth since the banks had refused to make any payments on behalf of the Punjab
government. PTI Punjab President Ijaz Chaudhri said the PML-N government of
Punjab had defrauded the innocent people of Punjab in the name of youth festival
and youth loan scheme, adding that the rulers would not be allowed to fool the
youth in future.

Talking about the youth loan scheme, Andleeb Abbas said the government move was
aimed at political point-scoring and promoting interest based economy and
business in the country. She said the PTI would strongly oppose these policies
of the government.

PM unveils Rs 20bln youth uplift package

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 262

LENGTH: 1277  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Saturday announced a development package
worth Rs 20 billion for the country's youth comprising six projects, aimed at
providing them assistance mainly through affordable education, soft loans and
skill-based training.

The six projects include Micro Interest Free Loans Scheme, Small Business Loans
Scheme, Youth Training Scheme, Youth Skill Development Scheme, Fee Assistance
Scheme and PM's Scheme for

Laptops Provision, said Nawaz Sharif in his televised address to the nation. He
said the government was committed to the uplift of youth.

"I am sure that a self-reliant and prosperous youth will prove as a vanguard in
the nation's journey towards national integrity, prosperity and sovereignty."

The Prime Minister announced that the six development schemes would be
applicable for the youth of four provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan.

The federal cabinet had approved the basic features of these programmes and the
system for their implementation was also in place.

He said,however,to ensure more transparency, clarity and merit in these schemes,
it was his desire to seek guidance from general public.

He said input on these schemes could be given at the website, www.pmo.gov.pk
<http://www.pmo.gov.pk>, being uploaded on September 23.

A special mobile number '80028' had also been dedicated for this purpose to
which suggestions could be sent through SMS.

He said the details of these schemes would also be circulated through national
media including newspapers and television channels.

Nawaz Sharif said the general public was welcome to send their written proposals
addressed to the Prime Minister's Office, Islamabad.

He said 10-days had been allocated for collection of suggestions and
recommendations, and said he would not be satisfied until receiving an ample
response from youth on the schemes meant for their prosperity.

The schemes would be launched soon after working on the proposals and giving
them a final shape.

He said Rs 20 million allocated for the schemes for youth was not a big amount,
however the limitation of resources owed to the severe economic problems of the
country.

The issues including electricity shortage, the projects about construction of
roads, motorways, hospitals and setting up of industrial units needed large
monetary resources.

He expressed hope that a time would come when the tax payers' money would be
largely spent on the welfare projects.

He vowed to allocate more funds for the schemes of public importance in coming
years.

About the first scheme, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the 'Micro Interest
Free Loans' is especially focussed upon the financially weak segments of
society. Under this scheme, a total of Rs 3.5 billion would be earmarked in the
current financial year, which would benefit about 250,000 people. No interest
would be charged on these loans.

He also announced Small Business Loan Scheme exclusively for the educated youth
willing to initiate their private businesses.

The Prime Minister said 50 percent loans would be specified for the women. Under
this scheme, skilled individuals would get loans worth Rs 0.5 million to Rs 2
million each to help start their work in agriculture sector or to open the
workshop.

"The markup rate on this loan would be 8 percent as the remaining would be borne
by the government. Initially, the National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank
will extend this loan," said the Prime Minister, adding that the government had
allocated Rs 5 billion for the scheme.

The third initiative, he said was Youth Training Scheme under which the youth
having completed 16-year education from accredited educational institutes would
be provided training so that they may find suitable job opportunities locally or
abroad.

He also prayed that every citizen may get job opportunity in the country without
going abroad.

The Prime Minister said during the on-job-training, the youth will be paid Rs
10,000 stipend monthly for one year and Rs4 billion have been allocated for the
scheme that would benefit around 50,000 graduates.

Under the Youth Skill Development Scheme, he said youngsters would be trained to
help them earn their livelihood respectfully. The youth aged upto 25 years and
with education upto eighth grade would be entitled to avail this facility.

"These youths will be trained for six months and will be paid Rs5,000 monthly as
stipend. However the charges of the training institutes will be borne by the
government," he said, adding Rs 800 million have been specified for the purpose.

The fifth scheme is about providing assistance to youth of underdeveloped areas
for their tuition fees. He said the government had decided not let any talented
youth remain uneducated if his parents were unable to meet his educational
expenses.

The government would pay for the tuition fees of all such deserving students at
masters level and above. For this purpose, an amount of 1.2 billion have been
allocated which would cover the expenses of some 30,000 students with an average
of Rs 40,000 yearly.

Under the Prime Minister's Scheme for Provision of Laptops, one million students
would be given laptops with an amount of Rs 4 billion reserved for the project.

The Laptop Scheme, which was first introduced in Punjab, had been extended to
the federal level in view of the importance of information technology.

Despite paucity of resources and myriad economic issues, certain

programmes were being initiated which would open doors of opportunities to the
weak segments of the society especially the youth."The main idea behind the
programme is to increase the self-dependency of the youth and provide them job
opportunities. The job opportunities in government sector have been shrinking
continuously and in Pakistan, these opportunities are also on the wane when
compared with the population increase," he said.

The Prime Minister lamented that billions of rupees could be saved which have
been going down the drain due to loss incurred by the national institutes.

Such a saved money should be spent on public welfare, education and job
opportunities of the youth, he said, adding that he had already stated that
every year, they have to pay Rs 500 annually to meet the losses of the
government run entities.

"This amount of Rs500 will be available to the government which would be spent
on the historic steps for a glorious future of the down-trodden strata of the
society and the youth which would bring social and economic revolution." He said
that one of the reason for malfunctioning of the government run institutes was
the unnecessary inductions done on the political basis.

Inductions on favouritism has eroded the merit and these institutes have now
been reeling under such unnecessary provision of jobs. The examples of PIA,
Pakistan Steel Mills and Pakistan Railways were before the nation and these
national institutions were given Rs 500 billion to meet the losses, he added.

The Prime Minister said in presence of strong private sector, the people
especially the youth, were given opportunities to earn their own living, so that
instead of running from pillar to post for seeking jobs, they could eke out for
their families.

He said these were the promises PML(N) made during election campaign and it
wanted a system in which youth could earn by itself and help others.

He said it was their government, which has a strong will and confident that
Pakistan would soon overcome its problems. Economy of Pakistan should be
strengthened in such a way that it did not require loan and foreign aid.

Announcing the initiatives of his government, he said that keeping these
objectives in mind, the government has decided to start such schemes.

PTI criticises loan scheme, Punjab youth festival

SECTION: Vol. L No. 101

LENGTH: 319  words


Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has lambasted the Punjab government for
plundering the taxpayers' money in the name Punjab Youth Festival. While
addressing a press conference here on Friday, PTI Punjab President Ejaz
Chaudhary said the festival, which is a biggest youth event in the history of
Pakistan, is marred by plundering of taxpayers' money.

He observed that students are forced to participate in a contest that is a hoax
and hence depriving them of education. "The Punjab government have been
blatantly lying on media that 'the Gunnies Book of World Record are genuine'
while its email clearly states that the 32 records have not been registered with
them, and the witnesses that are suppose to have been chosen are selected by the
Pakistani sports department," he added.

He averred that this is the biggest corruption scandal so far in the present
tenure of the PML-N's government, as it involves billions of rupees of public
money.

PTI Punjab Information Secretary Andleeb Abbas said the youth festival and youth
business loan are turned out to be the biggest financial disaster in the
country.

She said youth business loan scheme, which the government had claimed would
provide business to the youth, has been rejected even by the government's own
bank, as it is too risky to give out loans on the terms specified by the Prime
Minister and his daughter. "The National Bank has completely denied giving the
Islamic loans and too many reports have said that the bank will suffer if they
start going by the rules set in this scheme. It is a shame that this government
keeps on playing with the sentiments of the youth. The youth of this county
demand a third party audit of the festival and loan scheme, in which billions of
rupees are wasted," she added.

She said the PTI Youth Wing will hold protests if the government does not
explain how each penny of the taxpayers' money have been spent on these schemes.

Loans for youths to start computer training centres

BYLINE: By Azman Ahmad

SECTION: Business; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 458 words


THE Youth and Sports Ministry will provide RM10 million in loans to youths
to set up computer training centres throughout the country next year.

Its Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Mohd Yassin said 200 youths would be
selected under the pioneer programme where each would be given RM50,000 to
set up the centres.

He said the programme, aimed at encouraging more youths to be involved
in business activities would also help create a computer literate society,
in line with the information technology era.

"Each recipient is expected to settle the loan within 10 years," he
said.

"We will supply between eight and 10 computers for each training centre.
The centres will be spread out throughout the country with concentration
in major towns," he said.

Muhyiddin was speaking to reporters after signing a memorandum of
understanding on behalf of his ministry with the National Association of
Women Entrepreneurs of Malaysia, where the latter will carry out training
programmes for budding businesswomen, at his office in Kuala Lumpur
yesterday.

He said youths below 40 were eligible to apply for the loan, with
priority given to those with computer knowledge and who are business-
minded.

"Right now, we are looking for an established company with vast
experience in the computer field to assist the youths in running the
business, as well as offering advice on administrative matters," Muhyiddin
said.

He added that the ministry would also co-operate with interested
associations, including various chambers of commerce so that youths would
benefit from the experience of successful businessmen.

"We are talking with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers to
promote the setting up projects for youths. We are still in the midst of
identifying commercially-viable projects to be introduced to the youths,"
he said.

On the Youth Economic Fund programme, he said to date RM28 million of
the RM100 million loan had been given out to youths to start 1,900 small-
scale businesses.

"This year alone, we approved loans totalling RM5 million to youths to
start their own businesses," he said.

On the MoU, NAWEM president Mariam Sulaiman said the RM40,000 grant
approved by the ministry would be used for training programmes for women,
such as basic financial management, information technology and marketing
strategy.

"For the time being, we will only offer the entrepreneurship courses to
women who aspire to start their own businesses. Once we are financially
secure, similar courses will be extended to other States and maybe for the
opposite sex too," she said.

Also present were the ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Datuk Shahrizat
Abdul Jalil and Secretary-General Ahmad Bakri Sabdin.

PTI youth flays govt over loan scheme

SECTION: Vol. LXVIII No. 101

LENGTH: 280  words


The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Youth Wing has lambasted the federal government for
fooling the youth by launching the Youth Loan Scheme and failing to dispense
loans despite charging the youth millions of rupees across the country.

Speaking at a news conference at the PTI Punjab secretariat here on Friday, PTI
Youth Wing President Ali Abbas Bukhari said the federal as well as Punjab
governments should make the expenditures incurred on the loan scheme and youth
festival public within 10 days, otherwise, the PTI would move the court. He said
the Guinness Book of World Records had already exposed the Punjab government's
claims of making world records.

Bukhari said the government was spending millions of rupees on the loan scheme,
including on its advertisement but no youth had so far been issued the loan.

PTI Punjab President Ejaz Chaudhry said the Punjab Youth Festival was organised
at the cost of youth's education as they remained busy in attending festival and
filling the stadiums to make records.

He said the chief minister and sports minister were blatantly telling lies to
the media, saying the Guinness Book of World Records were genuine but the
international body's email clearly showed that 32 records made in Punjab had not
been registered. He said the email also said that the world record witnesses who
were supposed to be chosen by the Guinness Book of World Records were chosen by
the Pakistan Sports Board itself.

"The Punjab Youth Festival is the biggest corruption scandal of the PML-N
government as it involved billions of rupees of public money besides students'
precious time," he said.

PTI Punjab Information Secretary Andleeb Abbas and others also spoke.

international body's email clearly showed that 32 records made in Punjab had not
been registered. He said the email also said that the world record witnesses who
were supposed to be chosen by the Guinness Book of World Records were chosen by
the Pakistan Sports Board itself.

"The Punjab Youth Festival is the biggest corruption scandal of the PML-N
government as it involved billions of rupees of public money besides students'
precious time," he said.

PTI Punjab Information Secretary Andleeb Abbas and others also spoke.

Action against defaulters of business loans

LENGTH: 305 words

DATELINE: Marang


MARANG, Wed. - The Ministry of Youth and Sports has taken legal action
against 50 defaulters of business loans obtained under the Youth Economic
Fund scheme.

The Ministry's Youth director-general Raja Ruslan Raja Samah said loan
repayments had been poor.

"Not more than 50 per cent of the borrowers are committed to paying back
their loans and this is sad," he said.

Raja Ruslan said this today after presenting certificates on behalf of
the Youth and Sports Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin to about 400
trainees who had completed their training in various courses at Institut
Kemahiran Belia Negara in Wakaf Tapai.

To encourage borrowers to repay their loans, Raja Ruslan said the
ministry had to send its officers to see them.

Raja Ruslan said so far about 2,400 borrowers had secured about RM36
million loans from the RM100 million allocated to the fund since it was
established in 1988 to help enterprising youths starting their own
businesses.

He said the majority of IKBN graduates who wished to start their own
businesses were interested in opening restaurants and tailoring shops.

To a question on the number of applicants who had secured loans under
the Youth Economic Fund through BSN Commercial Bank Bhd, he said: "About
60 of them have succeeded in obtaining business loans totalling about RM2
million."

Raja Ruslan said this when asked to comment on the bank's tardiness in
dispersing loans allocated under the fund.

Muhyiddin was reported to have said the Government might terminate its
agreement with BSN Commercial Bank, a subsidiary of BSN, over loans given
out under the Youth Economic Fund.

The report said 617 applicants deemed eligible to apply for assistance
under the scheme had been waiting almost 18 months, but the bank had
failed to release the fund.

PM launches 'Youth Business Loans', says Youth an asset of country

SECTION: Vol. 18 No. 336

LENGTH: 862  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has launched 'Youth Business Loans' to help
young entrepreneurs to initiate their own businesses. Speaking at the launching
ceremony, he said it is a big contradiction that loans worth billions of rupees
are doled out to influential and resourceful people but underprivileged segments
of the population are deprived of the opportunities.

Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has said he is fulfilling the commitments
made with the youth during election campaign.

The Prime Minister said youth in other countries are backbone of their economies
and there is no reason that youth who constitutes 60 percent of our population
should not take us to zenith of progress and development.

The Prime Minister said in the past nationalization of industries and banks
destroyed the national economy.

He said our previous government denationalized and privatized the banks and now
they are earning billions of rupees and paying taxes to the government. He said
now the present government is going towards privatization of the entities.

Mian Nawaz Sharif said it is not job of the government to run factories rather
it should concentrate on improving law and order situation, weeding out
terrorism, addressing sectarianism, and improving image of the country.

The Prime Minister said during his recent visit to the United States President
Obama and senior members of his administration repeatedly asked one question as
to what the United States can do to help Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif said he told
them that Pakistan needs more access to your markets and not any financial aid.

Nawaz Sharif said the duration of electricity load shedding has come down but
the problem would remain there for the next three to four years and people will
have to demonstrate patience for positive results.

He said the issue would remain there until the shortages are overcome and the
gap between cost of generation and price of the electricity is bridged.

The Prime Minister acknowledged that prices of commodities increased in the
country due to rise in the price of POL products in the international market. He
however said the government was making strenuous efforts to overcome challenges
on all fronts.

He asked people to give the government some time to show results. He said the
government is formulating new laws to address the issue of law and order, an
operation is underway in Karachi and different projects are being launched to
overcome energy shortages.

Nawaz Sharif said an economic corridor would be established with the help of our
Chinese friends.

The Prime Minister said loans would be extended to youth purely on merit through
ballot and there would be no discretionary quota of anyone. He said over hundred
branches of the concerned banks would make their sovereign decision and also
record reasons for acceptance or rejection of the applications.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Maryam Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of the Mian Nawaz
Sharif's election commitments.

She said others only made pledges but the PML (N) government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.

Maryam Nawaz said there are only three conditions for the applicants - they
should be Pakistani, holder of valid Computerized National Identity Card and
should have a guarantor.

She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free of cost.

Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA offices to facilitate
applicants and guide them.

She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans.

The Chairperson said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the Loans.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current year's budget are practically being implemented.

He said the Prime Minister abolished his discretionary fund and the Government
slashed expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other Ministries and
Divisions by thirty percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also
being slashed to save 3.5 billion rupees.

He pointed out that Pakistan's position improved by twelve points in corruption
index prepared by Transparency International.

It is pertinent to mention here that it is designed to provide subsidized
financing at eight percent mark-up per annum for one hundred thousand
beneficiaries through National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank.

The total mark up rate would be fifteen percent but the Government would pay the
remaining seven percent on behalf of applicants.

Those falling in the age group of 21 and 45 years are eligible to apply for
loans from one hundred thousand to two million rupees.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years plus one year grace period
and a debt-equity ratio of 90:10 will be disbursed across the country including
four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas.

SMEDA has been tasked with an advisory role in the implementation of Prime
Minister's scheme.

financial year and in the first phase one hundred thousand unemployed youth
would be given loans through ballot.

The minister said that there would be complete transparency in the award of
loans and an effective monitoring mechanism will be developed to keep a check on
loan award process so that merit was ensured.

She said the concerned authorities of the National Bank of Pakistan and the
First Women Bank Limited would decide the eligibility of the applicants in a
transparent manner.

She said contrary to bank interests on loans which stood around 25 percent, they
would have to pay only 8 per cent per annum with one year as grace period while
7 per cent would be borne by the government.

Expressing her optimism for bright future of the youths, the minister said under
the Loans programme, the beneficiaries would be able to employ at least five
other persons in their business.

Top official: Azerbaijan will expand young people's chances for mortgage

BYLINE: E. Mehdiyev, Trend News Agency, Baku, Azerbaijan

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 465 words


July 10--Azerbaijan's state youth policy is based on national leader Heydar
Aliyev's policy, Head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration's Social
and Political Department Ali Hasanov said at a general meeting of young scholars
at the Azerbaijani National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday.

"Immediately after returning to power in 1993, Heydar Aliyev raised the
Azerbaijani youth's problems at the level of the state policy," he said.
"Earlier, the Azerbaijani youth's position was so terrible that it was actually
used against the country. By providing Azerbaijani youth with arms, certain
camps attracted it to struggle for power against the country, rather than to
protect the lands and to develop science, education, culture."

"The first ministry, created by National Leader Heydar Aliyev in 1994, was the
Ministry of Youth," Hasanov added.

"The Ministry of Youth and Sport, which reveals Azerbaijani youth's problems,
looks for the ways to solve them, directs the efforts of the country and the
society to search for these solutions, was established," he said. "Maybe,
Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani youth, Azerbaijani army and future of the nation formed
a large part of National Leader Heydar Aliyev's activity. So, it is easy for
President Aliyev to direct these young people today, whose foundation has been
laid correctly, which is the country's leading force, which will be able to
govern the country and to solve its problems in the future."

"President Aliyev put forward a new concept of mortgage loan issuing at an
enlarged meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers in early 2013," Hasanov added.

"This concept envisages the simplification of the mortgage loan issuing to young
scholars, youth, the cancellation of an initial charge or long-term loan
delivery for an initial charge," he said. "A mortgage loan issuing procedure
must be simplified. It is necessary to increase the number of banks and mortgage
loans. At present, the country's strategic currency reserves reach $50 billion.
Around $5 billion of these funds is sufficient for Azerbaijan's entire young
generation to receive loans and improve living conditions."

"The orders, given by the Azerbaijani President at a meeting of the Cabinet of
Ministers, refer to the banking sector, the Ministry of Economic Development, as
well as the public programs on science and those connected with the development
of young people," he said.

"I assure you that young people will be provided with favorable conditions for
getting mortgage loans in the near future to improve their living conditions,"
Hasanov said.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years plus one year grace period
and a debt-equity ratio of 90:10 will be disbursed across the country including
four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas.

SMEDA has been tasked with an advisory role in the implementation of Prime
Minister's scheme.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Maryam Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of the Mian Nawaz
Sharif's election commitments.

She said others only made pledges but the PML(N) government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.

Maryam Nawaz said there are only three conditions for the applicants - they
should be Pakistani, holder of valid Computerized National Identity Card and
should have a guarantor.

She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free of cost.

Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA offices to facilitate
applicants and guide them.

She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans.

The Chairperson said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the Loans.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current year's budget are practically being implemented.

He said the Prime Minister abolished his discretionary fund and the Government
slashed expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other Ministries and
Divisions by thirty percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also
being slashed to save 3.5 billion rupees.

He pointed out that Pakistan's position improved by twelve points in corruption

Funds set aside to help youths finance tenders

BYLINE: MAGATI OBEBO -1

LENGTH: 312  words


Waiguru says cash available immediately as she lobbies for increase in her
budget.

Kenyan youth will access up to Sh25m in loans to finance tenders they win at
both the national and county levels.
Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru said that youth, women and people
living with disabilities will use  local purchase orders (LPO) to apply for
loans to the Youth Fund.


She said her ministry came up with the initiative after many youths and women
could not raise funds to finance the contracts they were awarded by the
government.
"Our youths who had a  hard time  financing contracts because they did not have
collateral to secure loans from banks can now use LPO funding to access loans
without any security," said the Cabinet Secretary.
The LPO is the first official offer issued by a buyer to a seller indicating
types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services.
Ms Waiguru was speaking during a tour of Kisii County where she released cheques
worth Sh7.5 million to various women and youth groups from nine sub-counties.
She also inaugurated a Huduma Centre in Kisii town in an event attended by Kisii
Senator Chris Obure and Kitutu Chache  MP Richard Onyonka.
She urged youths in the country to take advantage of the LPO funding initiative
to bid for government tenders.
MORE MONEY
"There are youths that win tenders but lack funding. However, they can now
access loans from the Youth Fund to bail them out," she said.
The Devolution minister said there is need to sensitise the youth and other
groups on loans available in state-backed financial institutions.
"We shall roll out civic education programmes to sensitise more women and youth
countrywide and thus improve the uptake of funds," she said.
She said her ministry will request Sh6 billion during the next financial year to
help finance selected groups and address youth unemployment in the country.

Youth business loan scheme to bring change in life of youths

LENGTH: 268  words


Minister of State for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination,
Saira Afzal Tarar on Monday said that the Youth Business Loan Scheme will bring
a positive and healthy change in the life of country's youths.

The minister said that efforts are being made to make youth self-sufficient and
the present government of Pakistan Muslim League (N) is pursuing the policy to
bring prosperity in their life.

She said that Prime Minister's Youth Loan Programme would help overcome
unemployment in the country. She added the programme would focus on specially
rural areas as a major part of population was facing economic and unemployment
problems.

She said Rs 100 billion has been allocated for this programme during the
current financial year and in the first phase one hundred thousand unemployed
youth would be given loans through ballot.

The minister said that there would be complete transparency in the award of
loans and an effective monitoring mechanism will be developed to keep a check on
loan award process so that merit was ensured.

She said the concerned authorities of the National Bank of Pakistan and the
First Women Bank Limited would decide the eligibility of the applicants in a
transparent manner.

She said contrary to bank interests on loans which stood around 25 per cent,
they would have to pay only 8 per cent per annum with one year as grace period
while 7 per cent would be borne by the government.

Expressing her optimism for bright future of the youth, the minister said under
the Loans programme, the beneficiaries would be able to employ at least five
other persons in their business.

Pakistan: PM launches 'Youth Business Loans', says Youth an asset of country

LENGTH: 899  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Dec. 10 -- Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has launched 'Youth
Business Loans' to help young entrepreneurs to initiate their own businesses.

Speaking at the launching ceremony, he said it is a big contradiction that loans
worth billions of rupees are doled out to influential and resourceful people but
underprivileged segments of the population are deprived of the opportunities.

Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif has said he is fulfilling the commitments
made with the youth during election campaign.

The Prime Minister said youth in other countries are backbone of their economies
and there is no reason that youth who constitutes 60 percent of our population
should not take us to zenith of progress and development.

The Prime Minister said in the past nationalization of industries and banks
destroyed the national economy.

He said our previous government denationalized and privatized the banks and now
they are earning billions of rupees and paying taxes to the government. He said
now the present government is going towards privatization of the entities.

Mian Nawaz Sharif said it is not job of the government to run factories rather
it should concentrate on improving law and order situation, weeding out
terrorism, addressing sectarianism, and improving image of the country.

The Prime Minister said during his recent visit to the United States President
Obama and senior members of his administration repeatedly asked one question as
to what the United States can do to help Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif said he told
them that Pakistan needs more access to your markets and not any financial aid.

Nawaz Sharif said the duration of electricity load shedding has come down but
the problem would remain there for the next three to four years and people will
have to demonstrate patience for positive results.

He said the issue would remain there until the shortages are overcome and the
gap between cost of generation and price of the electricity is bridged.

The Prime Minister acknowledged that prices of commodities increased in the
country due to rise in the price of POL products in the international market. He
however said the government was making strenuous efforts to overcome challenges
on all fronts.

He asked people to give the government some time to show results. He said the
government is formulating new laws to address the issue of law and order, an
operation is underway in Karachi and different projects are being launched to
overcome energy shortages.

Nawaz Sharif said an economic corridor would be established with the help of our
Chinese friends.

The Prime Minister said loans would be extended to youth purely on merit through
ballot and there would be no discretionary quota of anyone. He said over hundred
branches of the concerned banks would make their sovereign decision and also
record reasons for acceptance or rejection of the applications.

Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Maryam Nawaz said the launching of loans is in fulfilment of the Mian Nawaz
Sharif's election commitments.

She said others only made pledges but the PML (N) government despite financial
crunch has successfully announced six youth welfare programmes including Youth
Business Loans.

Maryam Nawaz said there are only three conditions for the applicants - they
should be Pakistani, holder of valid Computerized National Identity Card and
should have a guarantor.

She said forms of the Youth Business Loans would be available from Monday and
these would be issued free of cost.

Special counters have been set up at banks and SMEDA offices to facilitate
applicants and guide them.

She also explained the procedure for processing of applications and other
details of the Youth Business Loans.

The Chairperson said necessary checks have been put in place to ensure
transparency of the Loans.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said parts of the election manifesto reflected in the
current year's budget are practically being implemented.

He said the Prime Minister abolished his discretionary fund and the Government
slashed expenditure of the PM office by forty percent and other Ministries and
Divisions by thirty percent. He said the number of foreign missions is also
being slashed to save 3.5 billion rupees.

He pointed out that Pakistan's position improved by twelve points in corruption
index prepared by Transparency International.

It is pertinent to mention here that it is designed to provide subsidized
financing at eight percent mark-up per annum for one hundred thousand
beneficiaries through National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank. The total
mark up rate would be fifteen percent but the Government would pay the remaining
seven percent on behalf of applicants.

Those falling in the age group of 21 and 45 years are eligible to apply for
loans from one hundred thousand to two million rupees.

Small business loans with tenure up to seven years plus one year grace period
and a debt-equity ratio of 90:10 will be disbursed across the country including
four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas.

SMEDA has been tasked with an advisory role in the implementation of Prime
Minister's scheme

PM extols Dar for fitting the budget well!

gThe glass is 90 per cent full and it is unfair to just point out the empty
space, says Sharif

gPM encourages youth for development as 5,200 more loan applications selected in
PMYBLS

Praising Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday
said that the government's budget for fiscal year 2014-15 will provide relief to
the public.

"Dar has had sleepless nights while he was preparing the budget. I'm sure good
things will follow," the premier said while addressing the second balloting
ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme (PMYBLS) in Islamabad.

Sharif said the government had little time to prepare its first budget last year
but still managed to meet some key targets for the outgoing fiscal year.

"The glass is 90 percent full and it is unfair to just point out the empty
space," the prime minister stressed.

Further, the prime minister said that the government was working day and night
and the results could be seen by the public.

"How can we have confidence in those who are unable to display results for their
[respective] provinces?" the prime minister asked while referring to criticism
by opposition parties.

The prime minister lauded the efforts of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and Maryam
Nawaz for making youth loan scheme a success.

Around 5,200 loan applications were selected successful in the second draw.

Nawaz Sharif distributed cheques among the successful applicants of the youth
loan. The initiative was designed to provide subsidized financing at 8 percent
mark-up per annum for 100,000 beneficiaries through the National Bank of
Pakistan and First Women Bank.

PM ENCOURAGES THE YOUTH:

Addressing the balloting ceremony, Prime Minister Sharif said that the
government started the loan scheme to provide the youth with opportunities to
make them financially stable.

"Big businesses easily get loans but deserving people with little resources are
not assisted adequately," he said, adding that there were numerous talented
people in the country who could change the fate of the nation.

The premier expressed confidence that the youth securing loans for businesses
would prove to be a harbinger of economic revolution in the country. Loan
programme would help alleviate poverty in the country, he said, adding that in
the first phase, 38,000 applications for loans had been received by the capital
under government's initiative for youth empowerment.

MORE MERCHANDISE FOR STUDENTS:

Sharif said that under fee reimbursement scheme, fees of students from
underprivileged areas would benefit deserving students and improve education in
country. He said his government will also distribute 100,000 laptops among the
students.

youth would certainly bring a change in the lives of millions of people.

Presiding over a meeting on the 'Business Loans Scheme' here on Monday, the

youth was my promise with the youth of my country. "It is time that we
materialise the promises," he said.

The prime minister categorically stated that no laxity and corruption would be
tolerated in the execution of the business loans scheme.

He added that facilitation counters would be established at banks for assisting
applicants. He further said that more than 0.5 million young people would be
given business loans in five years.

millions of families and give a boost to economic activities in the country.

Loan program targets young entrepreneurs

BYLINE: by Art Chamberlain TORONTO STAR

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D3

LENGTH: 395 words


   Canada's two biggest banks are fighting youth unemployment with an innovative
loan program they hope will back 5,000 businesses over the next five years.

People aged 18 to 29 are being urged to create their own jobs, since about 15
per cent in that age group are unemployed across Canada (and in Ontario) - much
higher than the over-all national rate of about 9 per cent.

Top executives from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of
Canada were to announce their support for the Canadian Youth Business Foundation
today in Ottawa.

"Youth Business isn't about 'throwing money' at the problem of youth
unemployment in this country," said Charlie Coffey, Royal's executive
vice-president, business banking. "It's about helping young people create their
own jobs."

The non-profit foundation, aided by other firms, including Air Canada, IBM
Canada Ltd. and the Bank of Montreal, will provide loans up to $15,000. The
average is expected to be $7,500.

Youth Business, which has an office in Toronto, will start with a pilot program
next month in London and hopes to lend to 150 businesses during the first year.

"We plan to roll out other sites in Halifax, Calgary and Scarborough within two
to three months," said Anne Cira, executive director of Youth Business.

The Toronto office isn't ready to handle applications yet, but people in
Scarborough won't have to wait long, Cira said.

CIBC is the biggest supporter of the program with a commitment of $3 million.
Royal Bank has kicked in $2.5 million over five years. Other sponsors are being
sought for the additional $1 million to $1.5 million a year that will be needed.

In addition, CIBC is providing a $7 million line of credit to finance the loans.

The banks are reluctant to handle such small loans through branches. The loans
are unlikely to make a profit, since it's expected about 25 per cent of the new
ventures will fail.

To qualify, budding entrepreneurs must have some training in starting a firm,
have a business plan and not qualify for normal loans or other programs.

Youth Business will match each firm with a mentor who can provide advice and
guidance.

Local volunteer committees will decide on loan applications. Youth Business
hopes to expand to six sites in its first year and up to 60 across Canada within
five years.

Pakistan: Govt diverting resources to common man: PM

LENGTH: 660  words

DATELINE: LAHORE


LAHORE, Jan. 19 -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said youth is the major
resource of nation and the government is committed to exploiting this resource
fully for better future of the country.

"Utilising potential and energies of youth for building a prosperous Pakistan,
is government's priority," the premier said while addressing the 12th
Convocation of Government College University Lahore on Friday.

Nawaz expressed the confidence in abilities of youth and hoped they would not
disappoint him in nation-building efforts. He said the government had diverted
resources towards the common man with the launch of the Youth Business Loan
Scheme, adding previously only selected people used to get loans and they paid
back nothing by getting these written off.

He said the government has launched Youth Business Loan Program with one-hundred
billion rupees. He added the government is diverting the resources towards
common man of the country, and in next five years, five-hundred thousand youth
will benefit from the loan scheme.

The Prime Minister said it will provide self employment opportunities to the
youth. He said the government is sure that the young generation will come
forward to play their role for development of country. He said forming a
conducive academic atmosphere in the educational institutions is the joint
responsibility of both teachers and students. He said our present should be
better than our past.

He said the government has enhanced the budget allocations for the education
sector from two percent to four percent. He said the Punjab government is also
taking concrete measures for development of education sector.

Earlier, Government College University awarded honorary doctorate degree to
Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif in recognition of his services.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was advised not to give loan to young people
who would not be returning it but he believed youth were honest and the nation
should trust them. He said it was unfortunate that youth had not been trusted
for the last six decades. He said the present government was going to provide
loans to 100,000 skilled youth so that they could contribute to the national
economy."I want to extend the programme to one million people per annum," he
added.

Citing examples of Germany, the US, the UK and South Korea, Nawaz Sharif said
that why Pakistan could not give a chance to youth if 80 percent youth of these
countries were contributing to their national economies.

He said that it was the duty of the government and parents to spend money on
their children but it was basic responsibility of students to transform the
investment into positive contribution for the nation.

He said that education was not only important for materialistic prosperity but
also equally important for intellectual development of a nation. "The study of
social sciences is equally important with the study of natural sciences," he
said.

He said it was the responsibility of the nation to form a knowledge-based
society as well as a knowledge-based economy through educational revolution,
adding the government was playing its role and now it was time for universities
and colleges to play their due role in this regard.

He called for formation of social, political and education systems to provide
equal opportunities to all. He said the government had provided equal
opportunities to the youth through the loan scheme and they could start their
own businesses instead of seeking jobs.

Commenting on the GSP Plus status for Pakistan, he said the achievement was made
possible with the efforts of Punjab Governor Ch Muhammad Sarwar. He also
recalled the days of his student life at Government College Lahore and asked the
students to remember the period in practical life as well

while the placement of remaining interns is in process.

Promoting Youth Entrepreneurship

BYLINE: Grace Mugoya

LENGTH: 506 words


FIFTEEN years ago, the government set up the National Youth Council (NYC) as one
of the mechanisms to empower the youth to effectively contribute towards
national development.

Today, the council has among its achievements, the promotion of youth
entrepreneurship through capacity building.

Gradually the council has extended its operations from the centre to all
administrative units up to cell level. NYC officials say that this has greatly
contributed to effective implementation of its programmes.

Beneficiaries of NYC programmes say the council has also supported them
financially to implement projects.

"We have been organized in youth cooperatives through which we get access to
funds from the council and this has enabled our cooperatives to set up income
generating activities in crop production and animal husbandry," said Yvette
Mushimiyimana, one of the beneficiaries from Nyanza district.

"Since we have no guarantee required by financial institutions before securing
loans, our access to finance has remained a challenge. However, with this
council, we are being supported to achieve our dreams," she said.

The Executive Secretary of NYC, Alphonse Nkuranga, told The Sunday Times that
annually, the council supports and trains 100 youths from each district.

"For the first five years, the council in partnership with other partners,
focused on unity and reconciliation, to bring youths under one umbrella,"
Nkuranga said.

He explained that later, efforts were directed towards empowering the youth
through skills development, especially entrepreneurship skills so that they can
start income generating activities.

Nkuranga said that at least Rwf 130 million has been used in extending support
to youth groups.

"This is one of the best ways through which the young generation will
effectively contribute to national development," he said.

Among other projects the council has supported to create means where the youth
can easily access finance is COOJAD, a saving and credit financial institution
for the youth.

Speaking to The Sunday Times, Cyprian Kananura, the Director of Finance and
Administration at COOJAD, said that the institution gives loans to its members (
youth) without asking for guarantees or collateral security.

"After they become members, we train them on the basic principles of how they
can benefit from our loans as well as encouraging them to save as this enables
them to service their loans," said Kananura.

The institution has so far registered 6000 members and gives out up to Rwf 5
million as loan.

"We had opened up branches in almost every province, but now we have partnered
with Umurenge Sacco although we still run four independent branches within
Kigali," he said.

Kananura added that the institution has so far given out over Rwf 1.6 billion to
2000 of its members.

Aline Uwere, 25 is one of the beneficiaries. She got a loan of Rwf 2 million and
managed to start a retail business.

"After becoming a member, I saved Rwf 250,000, I underwent a one month's
training and finally got Rwf 2 million loan," Uwera said.

Govt's self employment scheme leaves Soibugh youth helpless

LENGTH: 455 words

DATELINE: BUDGAM


BUDGAM, May 1 -- The government sponsored scheme to encourage self employment
has landed many youth into trouble in the Soibugh area of this central Kashmir
district. The affected youth are crying for help as they feel scared about their
future.

The government had started a scheme in 2009 for the unemployed youth to start
their self employment units. Many a youth availed the loan facility from the
Soibugh branch of State bank of India to realize their dreams. But their
business suffered initially on account of the disturbances during year of 2010.

This branch kept the certificates and other valuable documents as mortgage
against the loan amount which was disbursed to them. These youth were supposed
to clear the loan amount in the monthly installments as per the agreement.

In the meantime these youth crossed the upper age limit. As the bank had the
knowledge about this, it began to exploit these youth and began to use pressure
tactics to liquidate the loan amount, that too in a single installment.

"There was bad luck in store for we people as we failed to find the government
job. This government sponsored scheme came to our way as the soul igniting
moment. We were over the moon as seemingly our problems had been addressed,"
said Syed Showkat, who runs a Photostat shop the main stop in Soibugh.

Showkat went on saying that little did he knew that he will be kicked in the
abdomen since the bank exerted pressure on him to pay the loan amount in a
single effort. The manager of this branch has taken the matter to the court
turning all this into a nightmare for Showkat.

Like Showkat the other youth are very much worried about their future and they
find themselves in a state of depression as things are not going the right way
for them.

Another victim, Mohammad Ashraf while sharing his concerns with Early Times
said, "I have invested whole of the loan amount in the shawl business. Besides
carrying on this business I also have the other liabilities in terms of family
members as they are dependent on me. I cannot pay the bank loan in a single
installment."

Ghulam Ahmad Reshi, who also has started the shawl business under this
government sponsored scheme, supported the ideas of Showkat and Ashraf. He too
was quite cynical about his own future given the developments taking place
recently.

"We are not just three people, in fact we represent a larger group whose
sufferings are same. We make fervent appeal to the higher ups in the government
to come to our rescue and save our future from being spoiled," said Ashraf.

Business loan delays

BYLINE: Nasir Mehmood - Drosh, Chitral

SECTION: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Vol. LXVIII No. 148

LENGTH: 196  words


NAWAZ Sharif has announced a youth business loans scheme, with complicated
requirements, like a business plan and guarantors, which are to be fulfilled
before the submission of the loan application.

People, especially youths, fulfilled all pre-requisites and applied for the loan
with the hope that the amount of loan will be disbursed within a month or two.

It is unfortunate that not a single loan has been disbursed in Chitral, though
some six months have passed since the loan applications were submitted.

The prime minister and his team should do some homework before announcing such
plans. If the government has no finances for the loan, it should not raise false
hopes among the people, especially youths?

The same is the case with the provincial government's self-employment loan
scheme. A large number of applicants have been waiting for the loan for the last
one year.

Both the provincial and federal governments have badly failed in their promise
to give employments to youths through business and employment loans.

The prime minister, as well as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak,
is requested to take notice of the delay in disbursing the loan to the youth.

                           Govt works on new Youth Fund model - NewsDay Zimbabwe

LENGTH: 332  words


GOVERNMENT is working on a new model for the Youth Fund to reduce the defaulting
rate and encourage payoff by current defaulters, NewsDay has learnt.

TARISAI MANDIZHA

This development follows the temporary suspension of the Youth Fund by
government. The suspended fund, which targets youths between 18 and 35 years,
had underperformed with a loan default rate of 78%.

    A subsidiary of Old Mutual, CABS, is the disbursing agent of the $10 million
     Youth Fund which the parent firm availed as part of its compliance with the
                                            indigenisation and empowerment laws.
                                            The fund was launched two years ago.

      CABS acting managing director Simon Hammond said a temporary freeze of the
          facility was instituted by the trustees of the Youth Fund to allow the
   finalisation of a new model that is less risky and reduces the default rates.

  "There are increased collection efforts underway and defaulting youths will be
 subjected to litigation as is the norm in the recoveries process. The new model
 that is being designed for the Youth Fund will incorporate strategies to reduce
   the defaulter rate and encourage payoff by current defaulters," Hammond said.

To date, the total number of approved beneficiaries for the Youth Fund are 3 601
with an approved amount of $5 179 708 and of the approved amount, $4 925 173 was
                                  disbursed with an average loan size of $1 438.

            Hammond said measures were being taken to recover some of the money.

     The then Minister of Indigenisation and Youth Empowerment Francis Nhema had
  previously said CABS would resume disbursements, but with recommendations that
beneficiaries would need collateral or a guarantor to avoid a repeat of the high
                            default rate by youths that prompted its suspension.

   Nhema said that in an effort to recover the loans advanced to youths by CABS,
      the ministry has asked the various provincial officers to follow up on the
     loans. In some cases, Nhema revealed, they had rescheduled the loans and in
      other cases had asked parents of the defaulters to help them recoup money.

Sanneh - NEDI Established to Improve National Economic Growth

BYLINE: Fatoumatta K Saidykhan

LENGTH: 528 words


The National Enterprise Development Initiative (NEDI) is established to enhance
national economic growth and strives towards poverty reduction, says Anna
Jobe-Sanneh, the principal assistant secretary of the Ministry of Youth and
Sports.

She said the initiative is meant to support youth and women entrepreneurs
acquire necessary resources to venture into self-employment initiatives.

Madam Sanneh was speaking on behalf of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of
Youth and Sports during the validation workshop of NEDI Loan Policy held at
NEDI's head office along Kairaba Avenue.

She said the objective of the policy is to safeguard the loan assets of NEDI by
limiting lending risks, ensure consistency and objectivity in lending practices
and promote a common understanding amongst the Board of Directors and potential
beneficiaries of NEDI loans.

"The development of NEDI loan policy couldn't come at a better time than now,
when NEDI is transforming into a modern public institution. I have the
conviction that the policy will go a long way in addressing the existing
challenges of the loan application process in NEDI," she noted.

The principal assistant secretary of the Ministry of Youth and Sports revealed
that over the past one and a half year, NEDI with the support of the Office of
the Vice President and the Ministry of Youth and Sports has been working
tirelessly to improve on its status, in order to effectively respond to the
increasing needs of its targeted group.

The collaboration she said, has led to the enactment of the first ever NEDI
Bill; establishment of first NEDI Board of Directors; conduct of first NEDI
Audit; development of NEDI office and recruitment of permanent NEDI staff.
"Indeed, the progress made so far is impressive and there are high indications
that the loan policy will immensely consolidate the gains made she added."

Landing B. Sanneh, the general manager of NEDI while giving the historical
background of the agency said it was established in 2004, under the Office of
the Vice President; but given its nature, it was operationally attached to the
Ministry of Youth and Sports.

He said the main purpose of its establishment is to empower the Gambian youth
and women, through the provision of capacity building in entrepreneurship and
providing them with loans to set up their own businesses and offer them business
advice to ensure sustainability and timely loan repayment.

NEDI boss said the validation of the loan policy is another important milestone
in the development of the institution. "We set ourselves to change the face of
NEDI; two years ago we developed the [business plan 2012 to 2014] to help NEDI
to meet its targets. However, 90 percent of this plan has been achieved or met,"
General Manager Sanneh revealed.

Yaya Colley on behalf of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of NEDI
reiterated that the policy intends to maximise the loan portfolio of NEDI and to
protect the interest of youth and woman through appropriate lending.

He pointed out that this document when used properly would protect NEDI's funds,
as well as enhance the loan recovery process. Loans, he added, shall be issued
for productive purposes only.

3mn online forms downloaded for Youth Loan Scheme

LENGTH: 300  words


Gaining huge popularity across Pakistan day by day, the Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loan Scheme has gained formal response of at least 3 million citizens,
according to a parliamentary secretary.

Rana Muhammad Afzal Khan, the parliamentary secretary, revealed the online
statistics of the scheme; claiming that approximately 5 million forms have been
downloaded while 3 million forms have been submitted.

However, the loan scheme faced strict criticism from the religious circles of
the country due to the involvement of interests in the provided money for
business.

The huge number of forms' submission was seen after special notices of members
of national assembly clarifying that the loan will not be given to every person.

Earlier in last week, online statistics of Small and Medium Enterprises
Development Authority (SMEDA) showed that at least 2.1 million Pakistanis
downloaded application forms seeking business loans under the Prime Minister
Youth Loan Scheme.

Newly announced scheme for provision of business loans amongst Pakistani youths
on merit basis is collecting large-scale popularity amongst the citizens as 2.1
million online forms have been downloaded till now while 1.1 million people got
the forms in last two days.

According to SMEDA website records, 56 feasibility studies in English language
were uploaded on the official web before two months.

Pre-feasibility forms' download were made before the formal announcement of PM's
loan scheme while in last two days 1 million more downloads were recorded.

SMEDA has established 25 special youth centres in sixteen prominent cities for
the purpose of youth guidance, consultancy and technical information.

Pakistanis have praised the initiation of the loans' scheme and called it as a
significant positive step of the federal government.

Some schemes successful,others fall short of achieving targets

BYLINE: Zahid Gishkori

SECTION: Vol. 26 No. 304

LENGTH: 1351  words


Some of the schemes launched under the Prime Minister's Youth Programme (PMYP)
in past three years have missed their set targets while others achieved them.

The government confirmed irregularities worth Rs77 million in PM's Youth
Business Loan Scheme. Three years have been passed. Some 12,243 borrowers
received their disbursements worth Rs11 billion, official record and interviews
with more than a dozen stakeholders revealed. Loans' recovery remains 8% during
this period.

In December 2013, PM Nawaz Sharif announced net beneficiaries from this
programme would be about one million by 2017 throughout the country in next five
years. To execute the programme successfully, executing agencies were directed
to give loans to 15,000 to 20,000 youth per month.

Over 47,516 (56%) of total 85,000 applications were rejected during this period.
Around 3,965 applicants received disbursements in first balloting, 2,694
applicants received amounts in second balloting and cases of 1,584 applicants
completed successfully, revealed official documents exclusively obtained by The
News.

'The flagship programme lost its charm after Maryam Nawaz resigned from PMYP's
top position,' said a senior official, who is monitoring its progress. The
programme has apparently an overwhelming focus on Punjab while the PM promised
to extend loan broadly on the basis of provincial population, official record
suggested. Only 146 citizens benefited from this scheme in Balochistan, 163 in
Islamabad, 152 in Gilgit-Baltistan, 881 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 157 in Azad Jammu
and Kashmir, 552 in Sindh and 5,834 in Punjab, official data revealed.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) says the disbursement under this scheme was
almost half than sanctioned amount. Participating banks sanctioned Rs17.2
billion under this scheme but executing agencies cumulatively disbursed Rs11
billion so far. On first balloting held at Islamabad on February 2008, around
4,085 (76%) loans were given to youth in Punjab, 12% in KP, 6% in Sindh and less
than 2% each in Islamabad, AJK and Balochistan, according to the official
record.

Estimated 5,350 borrowers got the loans worth Rs5.2 billion in first balloting.
On June 4,2014, the government conducted second balloting where it approved 77%
loans for Punjab, 9% for KP, 7% for Sindh, 2.5% for AJK, 1.7% for Islamabad and
slightly over 1% loans were approved for each G-B and Balochistan. Around 4,000
beneficiaries got their loans after February 2016.

Around 99% loans were given by the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) though 18
banks are actively involved in this flagship programme, revealed the officials.
The NBP has released estimated Rs8.1 billion of total Rs11 billion
reimbursements in the lenders.

Leila Khan, in-charge of PMYP, said that no target was set for this programme.
'There is no specific target set as to the number of loans-it is up to the banks
to decide,' Leila Khan said. When asked why going goes tough for the programme
and alleged corruption, she said investigation report is expected to be
completed soon and we were waiting for response from the NBP and SBP on this
issue.

When asked about audit of these schemes, Leila Khan said, 'every scheme has an
executing agency and most of them have PC-1 which were approved by ECNEC and P
and D.' When asked does Maryam Nawaz offer any assistance to revamp the
programme for its better results, she said: 'As the PMYP is a part of the PM's
office, honorable PM himself is involved in checking on the status of each
scheme. Every year the schemes are tweaked a bit in order to make them more
productive as we continue to change according to the lessons learned.'

When asked when government sent case of alleged corruption in PM Youth Business
Loan Scheme to National Accountability Bureau, Zubair Mirza, NBP Executive Vice
President and head of policy, said he did not know about the development. But he
confirmed the irregularities worth Rs77 million in this programme saying 'all
misplaced amount has been recovered.' The fraud was allegedly happening by
opening bogus accounts of borrowers under this scheme, he explained.

Prime Minister's Youth Laptop Programme: The PM's Youth Laptop Programme (PMYLP)
achieved only 40% targets in last three years. The government under this
programme distributed 110,991 laptops among students across the country.
Estimated Rs25 billion were allocated for two phases where the government
promised to distribute 0.5 million laptops among youth in four years. As per the
contract, 50,000 laptops will be imported while the remaining 150,000 laptops
are going to be assembled locally in Pakistan at Haier Industrial Park, Lahore.
Some 11,719 laptops were distributed so far, remaining 88,000 will be
distributed by next month. HEC has so far distributed 93004 laptops to PhD,
MPhil/MS, Master's and bachelor's students of universities all over Pakistan.
Haier has set up local assembly unit at Raiwind Road Lahore. 1, 000 laptops have
been locally assembled as per the contract.

Prime Minister's Interest Free Loans Scheme: The Prime Ministers Interest Free
Loans Scheme (PMIFLS) could not achieve 40% targets after 0.25 million borrowers
were given interest free loans worth Rs4.7 billion in two years. Two and half
years back, PM Sharif set target of one million borrowers in four
years-2014-2018-in all districts with low socio-economic indicators. This
micro-finance facility aimed at helping the industry raise current access level
of 2.5 million people to 5 million in next 5 years. The partner organizations
approved 207,720 applications where 127, 720 beneficiaries are women and 80, 023
borrowers are males in 287 union councils in 44 districts across the country.
The government planned to target 63 districts, prioritising 15 districts of
Balochistan. But half of Balochistan districts could not be reached out so far.

Prime Minister's Youth Training Scheme: Under the Prime Minister's Youth
Training Scheme (PMYTS), the government planned to train 0.3 million fresh young
graduates of universities and technical institutes in four years. But it has
provided training to 50,000 youth and 25, 000 are planned to be trained by end
of this year. The government approved around Rs8 billion for this scheme, an
effort to provide practical training to young graduates by 2018. Some 29,000
youth have been trained while ministry of inter provincial coordination issued
offer letters to around 44,000 candidates whose have already been verified by
the higher education commission (HEC). Out of these 44,000 are interns, 33,000
degree holders whereas 11,000 are diploma holders. The HEC is also processing
the data of some 106,989 fresh applicants who will be getting training based on
their preferences and matching marketing demands by next year.

Prime Minister's Youth Skills Development Programme: The Prime Minister's Youth
Skills Development Programme (PMYSDP) almost achieved its all targets by
training 50,000 youth while 25,000 youth are under training in more than 100
demand-driven trades in Phase-III. The government allocated estimated Rs3.7
billion under this programme in three years. Madaris' graduates, with
certificates/diploma equivalent to Metric, along with disabled students were
also trained in different trades with specified quota 5%.

Prime Minister's Fee Reimbursement Scheme: The Prime Minister's Fee
Reimbursement Scheme (PMFRS) achieved its target. Around 103,712 students got
their fee reimbursed in last four years under this scheme which was initially
designed to reimburse tuition fees and on and off mandatory charges for the
students in 114 districts. Tuition fee of around 38,000 students were reimbursed
in Punjab, 17,133 in Balochistan, 14,474 in Sindh, 14,938 in KP, 9,892 in AJK,
3,368 in G-B, 5,906 students in FATA. Over Rs4.5 billion were spent from
2012-16. The government reimbursed fee of 50,000 students in 2013-14.

The Scheme was approved in June 2012 by the previous government and later it was
made an integral part of PMYP by PM Sharif. The scope of the programme has been
increased since then and now 114 districts of Pakistan are eligible under the
Scheme.

the government is committed to exploiting this resource fully for better future
of the country.

"Utilising potential and energies of youth for building a prosperous Pakistan,
is government's priority," the premier said while addressing the 12th
Convocation of Government College University Lahore on Friday.

Nawaz expressed the confidence in abilities of youth and hoped they would not
disappoint him in nation-building efforts. He said the government had diverted
resources towards the common man with the launch of the Youth Business Loan
Scheme, adding previously only selected people used to get loans and they paid
back nothing by getting these written off.

He said the government has launched Youth Business Loan Program with one-hundred
billion rupees. He added the government is diverting the resources towards
common man of the country[#x201a] and in next five years[#x201a] five-hundred
thousand youth will benefit from the loan scheme.

The Prime Minister said it will provide self employment opportunities to the
youth. He said the government is sure that the young generation will come
forward to play their role for development of country. He said forming a
conducive academic atmosphere in the educational institutions is the joint
responsibility of both teachers and students. He said our present should be
better than our past.

He said the government has enhanced the budget allocations for the education
sector from two percent to four percent. He said the Punjab government is also
taking concrete measures for development of education sector.

Earlier[#x201a] Government College University awarded honorary doctorate degree
to Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif in recognition of his services.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said he was advised not to give loan to young people
who would not be returning it but he believed youth were honest and the nation
should trust them. He said it was unfortunate that youth had not been trusted
for the last six decades. He said the present government was going to provide
loans to 100,000 skilled youth so that they could contribute to the national
economy."I want to extend the programme to one million people per annum," he
added.

Citing examples of Germany, the US, the UK and South Korea, Nawaz Sharif said
that why Pakistan could not give a chance to youth if 80 percent youth of these
countries were contributing to their national economies.

He said that it was the duty of the government and parents to spend money on
their children but it was basic responsibility of students to transform the
investment into positive contribution for the nation.

He said that education was not only important for materialistic prosperity but
also equally important for intellectual development of a nation. "The study of
social sciences is equally important with the study of natural sciences," he
said.

He said it was the responsibility of the nation to form a knowledge-based
society as well as a knowledge-based economy through educational revolution,
adding the government was playing its role and now it was time for universities
and colleges to play their due role in this regard.

He called for formation of social, political and education systems to provide
equal opportunities to all. He said the government had provided equal
opportunities to the youth through the loan scheme and they could start their
own businesses instead of seeking jobs.

Commenting on the GSP Plus status for Pakistan, he said the achievement was made
possible with the efforts of Punjab Governor Ch Muhammad Sarwar. He also
recalled the days of his student life at Government College Lahore and asked the
students to remember the period in practical life as well.

A grim Catch 22 is trapping students over jobs

BYLINE: By William Walker TORONTO STAR

SECTION: INSIGHT; Pg. E1

LENGTH: 1500 words

DATELINE: Ottawa


   Ottawa - CANADA'S YOUTH want Finance Minister Paul Martin to help them escape
the Catch 22 of education, employment and debt.

It goes like this: Young people are told to stay in school longer and get a
better education to have a better chance of finding a good job during Canada's
youth unemployment crisis - 17 per cent have no job.

The longer students stay in school, however, the more in debt they become.

Some graduate with student loans of up to $50,000.

Then they require a high-paying job just to make student loan payments and still
be able to afford food, transportation and shelter.

But Human Resources Minister Pierre Pettigrew admitted this week that many
students are being "scared" away from school by debt worries.

And if students drop out earlier, the chances of good employment are greatly
diminished, studies show.

"It's very much a Catch 22," says R. Hoops Harrison, national director of the
Canadian Alliance of Student Associations.

"It's a vicious circle of education and debt and the further you go in one area,
the worse it gets."

With Martin's federal budget expected Feb. 24, students and youth are looking
for help.

Martin himself says he will introduce measures in the budget to help reduce the
debt burden faced by graduating students.

He feels the government "has a fundamental challenge that it has to address" on
the issue of student debt.

There are many ideas about what Martin can do.

Heather Taylor, 23, has to go and live with her parents in Dawson City, Yukon,
this spring when her $350-a-month loan payments start to come due. She owes more
than $20,000 after four years at the University of Alberta.

What would be most helpful to youth would be an income-based repayment schedule
for student loans, she says.

That would help those who start out in low-wage jobs to pay their loans more
gradually at an affordable rate. Then when they get a higher paying job the loan
repayment amount would increase.

She suggests a 15-year cap on the length of the loan, so that young people in
low-wage jobs don't end up making payments seemingly forever and paying more
interest charges.

"A graduate will often change jobs about five times in the first two years, so
your income is very unstable, so it takes that into consideration," Taylor says.

"In the budget I think there should be a income-based repayment model, up front
grants for first and second year students, a system of deferred grants for
people who have graduated and a harmonized loan system between provinces and the
Canada Student Loan," she adds.

The student debt problem is key to the discussion about youth unemployment,
experts say.

That's because the most chronic unemployment problems faced by Canada's 600,000
jobless youth are caused by under-education.

Youth who drop out of high school or finish high school but do not further their
education are twice as likely to be unemployed, according to studies.

So to make themselves more employable, students need to pursue university or
college. That has become much more expensive with rising tuition fees.

A study by Carleton University's Ross Finnie shows that 1997 graduates will pay
76 per cent more for their education than 1990 graduates and much of that extra
cost will be borrowed.

"It's become an issue of accessibility. People just aren't going to school,"
Harrison says.

He calls for a national work study program to allow students to work while
attending post-secondary institutions.

Such a program, says Harrison, would let students apply their skills and allow
them to earn some extra cash.

Some provinces offer work study programs, but there needs to be co-ordination at
the national level, Harrison says.

Ottawa also would have to agree to pay a portion of the wages in such study
programs, he said.

In addition, Harrison says youth would benefit from a national mentorship
program.

Young people, he says, would obtain knowledge from being partnered with someone
already established in a field they wish to pursue. There would be no wages
involved.

"This would help youth make the transition from the education world to the work
world, because it would help in the understanding of what's necessary to get
there," he says.

Ottawa already has youth employment programs. It spent $440 million over the
past two years for apprenticeship programs, but it helped only 30,000 of
Canada's 600,000 unemployed youth.

The youth unemployment rate in Canada has dipped only slightly from 17.4 per
cent to 16.1 per cent during the past six months.

Prime Minister Jean Chretien also has pledged a millennium scholarship fund,
expected to be detailed in the budget. If it offers $2 billion, it could help up
to 140,000 students annually.

But it won't be much help to youth like Harrison or Taylor, since the fund isn't
to begin until the year 2000.

Now the challenge for Martin is to reinvest in apprenticeship programs and find
ways to design and introduce new programs. He already has committed to taking
steps to deal with the student debt issue.

Liberal MPs from Toronto want Martin to approve a $72 million plan to help 9,000
jobless youth across the megacity. The program is now on Pettigrew's desk for
the first stage of approval.

It would attempt to place about 9,000 unemployed youth aged 16 to 29 in
internships, where they would receive on-the-job training and actually work for
a company, sources say.

Organized through the Metro Separate School Board, the program would ask each of
the 9,000 companies that supply the board to take on one youth drop-out each.

Youth who are eligible for employment insurance would go off benefits while in
the program and be paid a salary based on $15,000 a year, half paid by the
private sector companies and half by Ottawa.

It's similar to the 750 internships that have been offered in the first year of
Career Edge, a Toronto-based not-for-profit company trying to help youth make
the transition into the work force.

Career Edge chairman Urban Joseph says many youth unemployment programs have
been tried, but what is needed now is co-ordination on a national level.

"The government has a number of good programs on youth employment but they're
overlapping," he says.

Ottawa should appoint a youth unemployment "czar" to finally bring together the
programs and eliminate duplication, Joseph declares.

Private sector companies often are contacted four or five times by different
government agencies running programs that vary only slightly, he says.

Joseph also has a new idea for Martin: In internship programs where a $15,000
annual wage is offered, the government should also build in a system for
forgiving student loan.

He suggested that a student in a one-year internship program would still be paid
the $15,000, but with $5,000 of their student loan forgiven, the total package
would be more like $20,000.

"That would hopefully get young people more interested in taking part in
internships," Joseph says.

Another possible solution is looking at the funding of post-secondary
institutions. He said funding appears to be geared toward Bachelor of Arts
degrees and not Bachelors of Science or Commerce.

"In today's market, students coming out with a B.A. aren't viewed by companies
as being trained right away for a job. We're dealing with 78 per cent of the
young people on our database with arts degrees and employers don't see them as
job-ready," Joseph said.

It's not that these students can't do the job - most of them adapt and learn new
skills once they get a chance, he said.

"At Career Edge, 84 per cent of our interns get hired (by the companies they
interned with), so they must be good. We just need to get them the chance to
become job-ready."

Youth like Harrison and Taylor both say they feel optimistic that Martin will
use his budget to help them out of this Catch 22 situation.

The federal government seems to be taking responsibility for this issue and not
just washing their hands of it," Harrison says.

Moving home to the Yukon involves more cost for Taylor, but she feels it's the
only place to start.

"With my parents that's a tough bridge to cross. My mother and dad thought they
had my brother and I out of their hair. Now I want to come home and they're like
'really?' "

She'll probably return to waitressing or working as a lifeguard to try to save
some money to eventually move out on her own, while still paying off her loan.

"I look at a lot of my friends who have graduated who are all in the same boat.
They don't have any (work) experience and they're finding it hard. Employers are
saying they want the experience ... but I think as youth we have a lot of raw
talent but we're not able to expose it and dev- elop it.

"It's really frustrating. I'm optimistic I'll be able to get a job, but still
the thought that I don't have a job and I have this huge debt scares me."

One in a series.

KIAMBU - Youths not applying for Uwezo loans

BYLINE: ANNE MACHARIA -1

LENGTH: 335  words


Youth groups at the grassroots are not taking up the Uwezo Fund loans as
expected.

According to John Kibaki, a youth representative in the Uwezo Fund Committee in
Kikuyu Sub-County, Kiambu County, majority of the targeted beneficiaries feared
taking up the loans.

As a result, Mr Kibaki said, there was fear that the youth would miss out in the
crucial funds.

"I fear that if the trend continues, young people will not benefit much from the
Uwezo Fund. Most of the applications we are getting are from women groups," Mr
Kibaki said.

"As we know, most women already have established groups participating in table
banking and other financial investments and it is therefore easy for them to get
the needed documentation and apply for the Uwezo Fund loans as opposed to the
youth."

Speaking in Kikuyu, Mr Kabki added that they were trying to reach out to more
young people to apply for the fund, but most feared because of the tagline that
it was a loan from the government, which they would repay whether the projects
they invested in succeeded or failed.

"We need young people to come up and take control of their finances through this
opportunity created by the Jubilee government and start projects that would earn
them income over years and stop just looking for white collar jobs," he said.

The Uwezo Fund was created by the Jubilee government to help the youth and women
access affordable loans for business enterprises.

Chairman of Ndutax Self-Help Group in Kabete, Kikuyu Simon Ngubi said their
youth group had applied for the Uwezo loan but faced some setbacks in the
application process.

"We do not have a group financial statement which is required during the
application for a loan and we fear our group might not get the money because of
this factor," said Mr Ngubi.

Some of the requirements to get the Uwezo Fund include colour copies of the
members' identification cards (IDs), a bank statement and evidence that the
group was registered for at least six months.

Nawaz vows to tap youth potential

LENGTH: 330  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that youth of Pakistan are the country's
greatest strength and the government would ensure that youth are gainfully
employed and helped in all respects.

He said this while chairing a meeting to review the Prime Minister's Youth

been included in the programme.

The Prime Minister's Youth Program comprises of six schemes including
Qarz-e-Hassana (micro interest-free loans), Small Business Loans, Youth Training
Scheme, Youth Skills Development Scheme, Provision of Laptops and Scheme for
Reimbursement of Fee for Students of less-developed areas.

The Prime Minister directed that 50 per cent loans should be reserved for women
in the Micro Interest-Free Loans scheme and the procedure for acquiring loans
should be made simple with shortest possible time for release.  Moreover, the
Prime Minister directed that youth from less developed areas including
Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu Kashmir be given priority in these
schemes, and 100 per cent transparency and merit be ensured.

The PM was apprised that initially 0.25 million youth would be provided with the
loans and One Hundred Thousand Laptops would be provided when the laptop scheme
is launched in January 2014.

He said that the government wants to provide various opportunities to the youth
including skilled education, trainings, employment and scholarships so that they
could contribute positively in all fields.

PM's Youth Development Programme

LENGTH: 774  words


In order to reduce poverty, accelerate employment oppor tunities, provide
skilled workforce to large, medium and small scale industry and to meet the
international labour market needs, the government initiated "Prime Minister's
Youth Skill Development Program.

"The federal government will soon launch one-year training programme for the
educated youth of the country to bring them in national activities. Under this
scheme about 50,000 internships will be provided to students, having sixteen
years of education.

Internees of the programme would get training according to their education in
public and private institutions of the country. Students of religious seminaries
meeting HEC cri teria will also be inducted in the skill development pro gramme.

Under the Youth Development Programme so far 25,000 youth from all over the
country, including Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, had been imparted training
in around 100 trades. Each internee would be given a stipend of 2000 rupees per
month but in the second phase, the internee would be given 2500 rupees per
month. To encour age those in Federally Administered Tribal Areas to take
advantage of this scheme the monthly stipend envisaged is 3000 rupees per month.

Small business loan for young entrepreneurs with tenure up to 8 years, with
first year grace period, and a debt : equi ty of 90 : 10 will be disbursed to
SME beneficiaries across Pakistan, covering; Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan, Azad Jammu  and  Kashmir and Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).

This is for young entrepreneurs between the age group of 21 - 45 years. It is
designed to provide subsidized financing at 8.0 percent mark-up per annum for
one hundred thousand (100,000) beneficiaries, through designated financial insti
tutions, initially through National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and First Women Bank
Ltd. (FWBL). It has a 50 percent quota for women and 5 percent quota for
families of Shaheed, Widows and Disabled persons. SMEDA has been tasked with an
advisory role in the execution of PM's scheme by providing more than fifty five
updated pre-feasi bilities for referencing by Loan beneficiaries and participat
ing banks to fully utilize their financial resources. SMEDA shall continue to
add additional prefeasibility.

However, it is not necessary to develop a project on these prefeasibility. Any
other projects will also be entertained by the banks. The prime minister
fulfilled his promise by initiating a number of schemes for the youth, including
laptop scheme, fee reimbursement scheme and interest free loan scheme for the
youth.

The youth training programme must be fully sup ported and one would hope
expanded over time. It is after all youth who must be trained to develop skills
for jobs that the economy needs which would fuel development in the country and
at the same time tackle religious fundamental ism that is fuelled by
unemployment and poverty. Mariyam Nawaz,

Chairperson (PMYLS) directed bank officials to take notice of grievances and
complaints of the people, con sidering it a national duty. She further added
that the region al heads should directly oversee the scheme for the positive
results by facilitating the applicants, providing them due guidance for
processing of the loan applications as well as helping them understand the core
objectives of the scheme It is a very good scheme but keeping in view the non
suc cess of some previous schemes such as Yellow cab Scheme, the Prime
Minister's present youth loan programme may not be fully disaster scheme. This
loan programme despite hav ing best features has several shortcomings, which
must be removed to make the loan scheme successful.

The success of this scheme could push the Gross Domestic Product growth rate up
if it was planned on long-term basis, besides stimulating more investment and
bringing down crimes graph, as it is already experienced in dozens of countries.
There is the need for taking some practical steps to make it a success. The
youth should be guided and educated on how they could better utilize the loan
for personal development.

The government should have developed a long-term policy for these loans as
results could not be achieved in one year. Nevertheless one must not forget the
distress of similar schemes in other parts of the world and even in Pakistan
where such loans did not reach the deserving. The success of public sector
business loan schemes depend upon an united approach, which consists of
enterprise growth skills, business approval provision, creativity and innovation
development as pre-requisites for applying and getting these loans approved.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Dec. 22 -- Gaining huge popularity across Pakistan day by day, the
Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme has gained formal response of at
least 3 million citizens, according to a parliamentary secretary.

Rana Muhammad Afzal Khan, the parliamentary secretary, revealed the online
statistics of the scheme; claiming that approximately 5 million forms have been
downloaded while 3 million forms have been submitted.

Development Authority (SMEDA) showed that at least 2.1 million Pakistanis
downloaded application forms seeking business loans under the Prime Minister
Youth Loan Scheme.

million online forms have been downloaded till now while 1.1 million people got
the forms in last two days.

According to SMEDA website records, 56 feasibility studies in English language
were uploaded on the official web before two months.

Pre-feasibility forms' download were made before the formal announcement of PM's
loan scheme while in last two days 1 million more downloads were recorded.

SMEDA has established 25 special youth centres in sixteen prominent cities for
the purpose of youth guidance, consultancy and technical information.

Pakistanis have praised the initiation of the loans' scheme and called it as a
significant positive step of the federal government

FOSTER YOUTH NOW. Agency changes tack

BYLINE: Andile April

SECTION: ECONOMY, BUSINESS & FINANCE

LENGTH: 626 words


FOSTER YOUTH NOW
  Agency changes tack
 THE National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) says it inherited major problems
when Umsobomvu Youth Fund (UYF) and the National Youth Commission (NYC) merged
to form the agency in 2009.



  Talking to Sunday World this week, NYDA CEO Steven Ngobeni says there are
issues which were not contained in either the UYF or the NYC hand-over reports.

 "For example, they were lacking in corporate partnerships. Partnering with
national government, provincial government, municipalities, and internal
partnerships and private partnerships are important when you are running an
organisation of this nature," Ngobeni says.
 In the past, he says, the agency focused more on small and medium enterprise
(SME) loans by giving relatively big loans to individuals to establish a
business employing about 10 people.
 "In real economic terms, that SME loan system only benefited about two people
in the mainstream of the country's economy," Ngobeni says.
 But now, he says, the NYDA focuses more on micro loans and on developing
entrepreneurs.
 "We focus on developing programmes that seek to uplift entrepreneurs, not to
discover entrepreneurs. This is done through training programmes and the
mentorship we provide. We also identify market linkages for them.
 "We further provide them with loans starting from R1000 up to R100000. Some of
these loans are converted into grants depending on the nature of the business.
 "This is the difference - in the past we could only fund a few people, but now
we are able to cover more ground in terms of funding."
  In the past, he says, young people used to seek help in a particular area but
now the approach is to look for young people and provide them with interventions
in the areas that matter the most.
 "We no longer just give people vouchers to start a business, but we develop
entrepreneurs who can later, due to their success, attract bigger funders like
commercial banks and other institutions that consider bigger loans."

 But, he says, the agency is now facing a new challenge as their resources have
been squeezed by the national government.
 Ngobeni says instead of the Treasury giving them more resources in terms of
their funding allocation, the agency's funds for the 2012-13 financial year have
been reduced by R29m.
 Ngobeni therefore questions the commitment of the country's political
leadership to youth development.
  South Africa's leaders seem to be taking a direction that "says the youth is
just part and parcel of our population and doesn't need special treatment", he
says.
 Ngobeni maintains that the leadership has forgotten that the youth is
tomorrow's leadership and "they also forget that the youth is the majority in
terms of the voters roll and in terms of population figures, which puts them at
about 42% to 43% [of the total]".
  Today's youth will soon become economically active, and his main worry,
Ngobeni says, is whether they will be employed or not when that time comes.
 "To be economically active does not necessarily mean being occupied, but could
also mean being unemployed yet active. This means you have the potential to make
the economy work, but the question is whether you are occupied and utilised
effectively in the growth and development of the economy.
 "By then we will have more useless people in the economically active category
simply because they are not being prepared now. They are not given the
appropriate skills for them to take up those responsibilities when the time
comes.
 "Some of them have studied but are not given opportunities and exposure in
their field of qualification," he says.

Govt to generate 25,000MW by 2025: PM

BYLINE:  Our Staff Reporter

SECTION: Vol. XXVIII No. 002

LENGTH: 881  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday said his government was determined to
eliminate unemployment, poverty and illiteracy from the country through youth
-oriented projects by channelising potential of youngsters.

Addressing a ceremony to mark the first balloting of aspirants of Prime Minister
Youth Business Loan Scheme, the prime minister said the government desired to
expand the said scheme to the extent that the country got rid of unemployment.
He said around Rs 3.70 billion would be disbursed among 5,399 applicants
declared successful through the first balloting.

The prime minister said in the past the banks had restricted their loan
facilities to influential people, ignoring around 90 percent of the population
that could change the country's future like all developed nations.

He said the poor population faced neglect in the past despite having
qualification, expertise and dedication as all they lacked were resources.
However, the government would help their dreams come true through such schemes,
he added.

Nawaz Sharif said his announcement for the youth loan scheme during the
electioneering was not a political slogan; rather it was his strong commitment
to ensure access of this segment of the society to the national resources.

He said small and medium enterprises always led the national economy, but in
Pakistan the youth welfare always remained confined to words only.

"We will change the lives of the people. Though changing fate lies with Allah,
someone has to become a source for this," he remarked. He told the gathering
that the country's economy was heading positively with increase in investment by
5 percent, tax recovery by 17 percent till January this year and industrial
growth by 6.6 percent till December last.

He said the government had to take tough decisions in the initial days that
increased inflation because the previous governments had done nothing to address
energy crisis and other grave issues.

He said loadshedding has decreased remarkably and vowed to end the same as
various energy projects were underway to meet the country's energy requirements
till 2025 by generating around 25,000 megawatts.

The prime minister said work on Karachi-Lahore Motorway would be started very
soon while phase-wise construction of Lahore-Multan, Sukkur-Multan and
Sukkur-Hyderabad sections would be carried out.

He hoped the youth would come forward by starting their own businesses in
various sectors which would not only support their families but also create jobs
opportunities for others.

He said around 28,000 applications were received from Punjab, 3,000 from Sindh,
3,500 from KPK, 1,000 from Balochistan, 600 from Islamabad, 500 from AJK and 100
from Gilgit-Baltistan.

He said out of the processed 6,000 applications, 5,399 would be balloted and the
successful candidates would be informed through SMS.

He said the volume of loans to a particular province would not surpass the
provincial quota and the government has targeted 100,000 applicants to disburse
loans in 2013-14.

He urged the people from all the provinces, particularly women, to come forward
for taking part in the national development and apply for the loan to exploit
the allocated limit for their respective provinces.

The gathering was told that the balloting had been carried out among the male
applicants from Punjab as they outnumbered the set allocated quota as
applications from other provinces was lower than the quota.

The prime minister said out of the 38,000 total applications received by the
banks, 31,000 were men and 7,000 women and majority of them was between 21 and
30 years.

Later, the prime minister carried out the balloting by pressing a computer key.

Addressing the gathering, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the country's economy
had suffered due to uneven distribution of resources in the past as the youth
population was never made partner in the national development.

He said State Bank had directed all commercial banks to divert their resources
to the PM's Youth Loan Scheme. "If they tilt only 10 percent of the country's

Govt to generate 25,000MW by 2025: PM

BYLINE:  Our Staff Reporter

SECTION: Vol. XXVIII No. 002

LENGTH: 881  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday said his government was determined to
eliminate unemployment, poverty and illiteracy from the country through youth
-oriented projects by channelising potential of youngsters.

Addressing a ceremony to mark the first balloting of aspirants of Prime Minister
Youth Business Loan Scheme, the prime minister said the government desired to
expand the said scheme to the extent that the country got rid of unemployment.
He said around Rs 3.70 billion would be disbursed among 5,399 applicants
declared successful through the first balloting.

The prime minister said in the past the banks had restricted their loan
facilities to influential people, ignoring around 90 percent of the population
that could change the country's future like all developed nations.

He said the poor population faced neglect in the past despite having
qualification, expertise and dedication as all they lacked were resources.
However, the government would help their dreams come true through such schemes,
he added.

Nawaz Sharif said his announcement for the youth loan scheme during the
electioneering was not a political slogan; rather it was his strong commitment
to ensure access of this segment of the society to the national resources.

He said small and medium enterprises always led the national economy, but in
Pakistan the youth welfare always remained confined to words only.

"We will change the lives of the people. Though changing fate lies with Allah,
someone has to become a source for this," he remarked. He told the gathering
that the country's economy was heading positively with increase in investment by
5 percent, tax recovery by 17 percent till January this year and industrial
growth by 6.6 percent till December last.

He said the government had to take tough decisions in the initial days that
increased inflation because the previous governments had done nothing to address
energy crisis and other grave issues.

He said loadshedding has decreased remarkably and vowed to end the same as
various energy projects were underway to meet the country's energy requirements
till 2025 by generating around 25,000 megawatts.

The prime minister said work on Karachi-Lahore Motorway would be started very
soon while phase-wise construction of Lahore-Multan, Sukkur-Multan and
Sukkur-Hyderabad sections would be carried out.

He hoped the youth would come forward by starting their own businesses in
various sectors which would not only support their families but also create jobs
opportunities for others.

He said around 28,000 applications were received from Punjab, 3,000 from Sindh,
3,500 from KPK, 1,000 from Balochistan, 600 from Islamabad, 500 from AJK and 100
from Gilgit-Baltistan.

He said out of the processed 6,000 applications, 5,399 would be balloted and the
successful candidates would be informed through SMS.

He said the volume of loans to a particular province would not surpass the
provincial quota and the government has targeted 100,000 applicants to disburse
loans in 2013-14.

He urged the people from all the provinces, particularly women, to come forward
for taking part in the national development and apply for the loan to exploit
the allocated limit for their respective provinces.

The gathering was told that the balloting had been carried out among the male
applicants from Punjab as they outnumbered the set allocated quota as
applications from other provinces was lower than the quota.

The prime minister said out of the 38,000 total applications received by the
banks, 31,000 were men and 7,000 women and majority of them was between 21 and
30 years.

Later, the prime minister carried out the balloting by pressing a computer key.

Addressing the gathering, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said the country's economy
had suffered due to uneven distribution of resources in the past as the youth
population was never made partner in the national development.

He said State Bank had directed all commercial banks to divert their resources
to the PM's Youth Loan Scheme. "If they tilt only 10 percent of the country's
total loan portfolio worth Rs 5,000 billion, the youth will get around Rs 500
billion loan," he added.

Referring to the government's steps to improve the national economy, he said a
survey carried out by a Japanese organisation revealed that Pakistan would be
the choicest place within next few years. A renowned economic Jim O'neil also
forecast Pakistan as 18th biggest economy by year 2050, he revealed.

NBP President Syed Ahmed Iqbal and NBP Chairman Munir Kamal also addressed the

Easier terms for youth loans

SECTION: National; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 235 words

DATELINE: Kota Baru


KOTA BARU, Sat. - The Youth and Sports Ministry has agreed to relax the
conditions for the Youth Entrepreneur Fund to enable more youths to apply
for loans.

Its Minister, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, said the Ministry had agreed to
allow youths earning RM800 a month to apply for a maximum loan of
RM10,000.

"For those who qualify for the RM50,000 loan, they will only have to pay
RM300 monthly for a period of 10 years," he told reporters after launching
Abim's Bakti Brigade, here.

He added the Ministry would only impose a two per cent service charge
annually for the loans and borrowers may start paying back the loan a year
after it was taken.

He also said the Ministry was working with a bank to ensure the loan was
accessible throughout the country.

Muyhiddin added that the Ministry had also agreed to extend the
eligibility age limit from 35 to 40 years old.

He said the Ministry had received an additional RM20 million from the
Finance Ministry recently.

"Some 5,000 youths will benefit from the loans this year," he said.

To make it easier for them to apply, he said, the Ministry would
consider allowing them to use their property as collateral if they did not
have a regular income.

He said those who applied for the loans need not attend any course.
Those who had businesses and would like to expand them, the Ministry could
consider loans of up to RM100,000.

Youth fund plans to blacklist defaulters

BYLINE: JOSHUA MASINDE -1

LENGTH: 377  words


Decision likely to see thousands of young people denied loans in other financial
institutions.

The youth fund will forward names of all beneficiaries who are not servicing
their loans to credit reference bureaus.
The decision will see thousands of youths denied credit in local financial
institutions.


In a newspaper advert on Friday, the Youth Enterprise Development Fund said it
is in the process of registering with Credit Reference Bureaus (CRB) so as to
take action against defaulters, whose failure to repay loans has denied others
Kenyans from benefiting from the scheme.
"Loans that have not been paid as per loan agreements will be listed (including
those advanced to financial institutions)," the fund's chief executive officer,
Ms Catherine Namuye, said.
Youths with non-performing loans have been given 30 days to repay or present
themselves to the fund's office to agree on an acceptable repayment plan.
REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT
The fund was established in 2006 to provide loans to youth enterprises with a
view to enable them start businesses and help reduce unemployment.
It funds young people in the 18-to-35-year age bracket. Kenyans in this age
group are estimated to be 13 million and account for 61 per cent of the
unemployed people in Kenya.
The fund was transformed into a State Corporation in May 2007.
Since its establishment, the organisation has issued loans worth Sh10.6 billion
to 263,000 youth-run enterprises across the country.
It charges borrowers 8.5 per cent interest rate per year.
The fund was, however, yet to disclose the amount of money in default by the
time of going to press.
"Loans listed with CRB will remain on record for a period of five years, even
after the loans are fully paid," the fund further said.
INFORMATION SHARING
Blacklisting defaulters will be a boon for CRBs that have been casting their
nets wider to incorporate entities such as development finance institutions,
Saccos, credit only Micro Finance Institutions, the Higher Education Loans
Board, telecoms, utility providers and manufacturers, among others, in the
information sharing mechanism.
Currently, commercial banks and microfinanciers rely on customers' credit rating
information to determine the premium to charge on interest rates and whether or
not to give loans.

BYLINE: Annelien Van Wyk

LENGTH: 920  words

DATELINE: Keetmanshoop


The Namibia Youth Credit Scheme (NYCS) is a youth credit initiative formulated
to enable youth of Namibia to access capital, enabling them to significantly
participate in the socio-economic development of Namibia, according to a report
by the scheme.

The NYCS was co-funded by the Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and
Culture (MYNSSC) and the Social Security Commission of Namibia. It is an
integrated support programme, providing simplified business management training
as well as loans ranging from N$400 to N$4000 as a means of supporting youth of
ages ranging from 18 to 35 years in their efforts to establish small and medium
enterprise (SME) initiatives as strategies for self-employment and income
generation, thereby improving their living standards.

"NYCS aims to create employment and contribute to the alleviation of poverty in
Namibia through youth economic empowerment. This programme has its operational
frame work pivoted on Youth Entrepreneurship Development of the Commonwealth
Youth Programme Plan of Action for 2008/2015 and is in line with Namibia's
Vision 2030 and the Millennium Development Goals," the report further states.

It further informs that the initiative was borrowed from the Commonwealth and is
a micro credit and enterprise initiative designed to promote employment and
alleviate poverty among the youth of the Commonwealth countries.

The MYNSSC signed an agreement with the Commonwealth Youth Programme (CYP) to
initiate Commonwealth Youth Credit Initiative in Namibia to complement national
efforts for reducing youth unemployment with the aim of building economic
self-sufficiency, widening economic participation and contributing to national
economic and developmental goals.

NYCS rides on the success of, and lessons learned from its two-year pilot
project that ended in 2007. Based on the results of the two-year pilot project
that was run in four regions of the country, namely Omusati, Oshikoto, Oshana
and Ohangwena. The Cabinet approved the implementation of NYCS in all thirteen
regions of Namibia for a period of five years ending 2010.

Initiated by the Commonwealth and Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and
Culture in 2004, NYCS is a product of the Ministry of Youth, National Service,
Sport and Culture with the goals of increasing participation of youth in
economic affairs; promotion of entrepreneurial culture among the youth through
structured and integrated support; increasing access to business support
services like training, counseling, mentoring, motivation to a marginalised
segment of the population more especially to out-of-school youth; increasing
access to financial services among the poor through strengthening micro finance
intermediaries in the country.

NYCS envision being the leading agency in harnessing and developing innovation
and entrepreneurship among the youth for employment and wealth creation, with
its mission to create an environment under which youth entrepreneurs can be
empowered to contribute to the country's socio-economic development.

Youth who have the initiative to develop credible business ideas into profit
earning ventures are assisted with credit and training, equipping them with
entrepreneurial skills and financial resources necessary to grow and expand
their business ventures.

This way the initiative will financially equip and mentor the beneficiary, young
entrepreneurs in a bid to increase their contribution to the socio-economic
development of the country's economy as stated in the report.

The core values of NYCS is good governance, integrity, efficiency and
effectiveness, transparency and accountability, equal opportunity and unity in
diversity.

Its integration package includes training; loan fund; capacity building and
coordination; consultancies; studies and technical assistance and mentorship.

According to the report, the programme is currently running in Omusati, Oshana,
Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Kunene, Kavango, Caprivi and Omaheke.

It will soon be implemented in Karas, Hardap, Erongo and Otjozondjupa.

The goal of NYCS, through its objectives, are the creation of 13000 jobs through
the youth establishing enterprises and creating employment for themselves and
other unemployed youth; provision of basic business management skills to at
least 5000 youth with the aim of introducing them to entrepreneurial culture and
provide them with competitive advantage as they enter the business world;
establishment of 5000 sustainable enterprises by the youth who have gone through
NYCS business training.

These youth are provided with loans and are monitored by all relevant
stakeholders after receipt of loan; 200 village banks referred to as Savings and
Credit Associations (SCAs) operating under the Omusati Model will be capacitated
since they are used in a number of regions as the delivering vehicles of
finances to the young people envisaged to participate in the programme. This
model is used by RISE Namibia, one of NYCS implementing agencies; strengthening
the capacity of five financial institutions to become micro finance
institutions; establishing of a revolving loan fund of N$15000000 derived from
loan repayments from the youth; mobilise savings through village banks and youth
groups amounting to N$10000000.

MYNSSC articulates policy on matters related to youth empowerment. It is
responsible for the design and promotion of the programme. At regional level,
regional youth centres and officers are responsible for the promotion of the
programme and monitoring its implantation process.

Youth loan scheme: conditions eased, says Prime Minister

LENGTH: 480  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday said the conditions for guarantors in the
Youth Business Loan Scheme have been eased keeping in view the difficulties
faced by the youth.

He said that now any person including blood relation/family member having a net
worth of 1.5 times the loan can give a guarantee. Further, any Grade-15 or above
government officer who still has eight or more years in service can be a
guarantor.

More than one person with cumulative net worth of more than 1.5 times the loan
can give a collective guarantee against a single loan application. Anyone with a
net worth more than 1.5 times the loan can give his own guarantee.

Moreover, applicant's bank account can be in any bank including National Bank of
Pakistan, the Prime Minister said. He made these remarks in his address to the
applicants of Youth Business Loan Scheme at Hyderabad.

The Prime Minister said that we have to trust our youth and want to give them
financial independence so that they can play their positive role in the economy
of the country. He disclosed that the recovery rate in the Yellow Cab scheme was
around 99%.

The Prime Minister said that previously loans were only extended to big
personalities and entities while small loan borrowers were neglected. "We have
decided to award loans to small borrowers in order to give benefit to the
skilled youth and lower strata of society. This will not only benefit the small
borrowers but their families and people who will get employed in these projects.
The number of beneficiaries will run in hundreds of thousands," PM added.

He further said that his government ensured transparency at every level in the
process of granting loans. "Not even my "Safarish" (preferential recommendation)
will be accepted in it," PM said. He said the culture of favouritism and
nepotism is a cancer which has eaten into the vitals of our society and we want
to ensure transparency and merit at every level in the government.

Later, the Prime Minister met the applicants and enquired from them about their
plans after they get the loans. The applicants were enthusiastic to find Prime
Minister in their midst and said the loan scheme would help them utilise their
skills not only for the benefit of their own selves but their families and
society at large too.

Speaking about infrastructure projects in Sindh, the Prime Minister said that
his government has a comprehensive plan to build a road network in Hyderabad and
Karachi, adding that the Japanese government has shown interest in Karachi
Circular Railway Project and the project would be initiated soon.

Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage Senator
Pervaiz Rashid and Chief Minister Sindh Qaim Ali Shah and other senior
government officials were also present on the occasion. Earlier, upon his
arrival, the Prime Minister was received by Chief Minister Sindh Qaim Ali Shah.

Criteria for guarantors, mark-up issue: many KP youths show lack of interest in
Prime Minister's loan scheme

SECTION: Vol. XLIX No. 344

LENGTH: 754  words


The issue of mark-up (Riba) and strict criteria for guarantors turned youth
seeking business loans under the Prime Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme
reluctant, which had slow the submission of application down in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa.

Talking to this scribe, an official concerned with the facilitation of the youth
in obtaining the loan confirmed on condition of anonymity that a large number of
youth from both genders of boy and girls are showing lack of interest in
acceptance to the criteria of the scheme.

He was of the view that as compare to the tremendous response exhibited by the
youth even before the formal launching of the scheme are now feeling shy in the
submission of the forms as majority of them are facing difficulties in finding
guarantors.

Mohammad Saeed, 19, resident of Gulbahar said that scheme is just an eyewash to
divert the attention of the youth from the critical issues like poverty,
joblessness and militancy. He said the scheme will benefit people only from a
rich family, since it is next to impossible for a poor youth to find out a
guarantor of BPS 15 or above officer or a rich person as a guarantor.

The Prime Minister's scheme has been launched with a view to achieve the goal of
sustainable livelihood, yet it has failed on multiple fronts to meet common
approbation. The scheme will not be able to serve the weaker segment of the
society; many youth confided this statement while talking to this scribe.

Sherazam Khan, 33, upbraided the scheme and called it a net to trap youth in a
vicious circle of interest. He said he had a Fatwa against the loan that it is
purely un-Islamic and Haram. He voiced his concern and said that such schemes
will open ways for fresh scams.

Talking about the procedural problems, Amir Zia, said that he is illiterate and
could not make a feasibility of the proposed business, which is essential
requirement for availing the loan facility.

Expressing his views on the provision of pre-feasibility with the form, Naeem
said that he has been roaming between the SMEDA and the National Bank to sort
out the issue of pre-feasibility but failed. He went on to say that he wanted to
start a poultry business and looking to avail the loan for the business. But the
National Bank has refused to accept his form on the pretext that the
pre-feasibility is not valid for Chitral.

Naveed Akbar slammed the scheme for its high interest and said that there is
mark-up even on the first year of loan though no instalments as it is called
grace period. He also pinpointed that the pre-feasibilities available on the
SMEDA website are in English; hence it is of no use for an illiterate or less
qualified person.

He stressed the need for translating the pre-feasibilities into Urdu. He also
hinted that most of applicants are not aware of the fact that whether the pre-
feasibility of SMEDA should be attested by the organisation concerned or not. He
suggested that the pre-feasibility condition should also be reviewed as it had
been creating confusion.

Pakistan being in the quagmire of poverty and jobless do need such initiatives
to steer the country towards economic prosperity and development. Such schemes
are gaining grounds in developing countries and are considered the only panacea
for curbing poverty. But it is important for loaning schemes to be transparent
and free of misgivings to achieve the desired results. Though it is dawn of the
scheme, yet it begins to shroud in doubts and criticism.

Nazish Iqbal, a student of Peshawar University, observed that poverty is a stark
reality though; she will not compromise on religion and will not accept anything
based on interest. She said that availing the loan is far away; even providing
information to someone regarding the scheme is un-Islamic. She maintained that
as per an order of the full bench of the apex court of Riba is fully banned in
Pakistan.

Noman, a watchmaker, when asked about the utility of the scheme, replied that
the prime minister is behaving like a naïve person by opening a Pandora box in
the shape of Youth Business Loan. He said that like his previous scheme of
Yellow Cab it will also die its death soon enough. He underlined several flaws
in the scheme and said that it might help Maryam Nawaz to add to her popularity
but will never be instrumental in eradicating poverty from the country.

A National Bank officer, on condition of anonymity, said that he may go on long
leave since he believes that YBL scheme is un-Islamic due to mark-up and against
the injunction of the Holy Quran and Sunnah.

Farm loan programs modified under new 2014 Farm Bill

BYLINE: Ivanhoe Times staff

LENGTH: 439  words


WASHINGTON, D.C.-The new 2014 Farm Bill signed into law by President Barak Obama
on February 7, updates certain requirements and modifies several loan programs
administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

Several areas that FSA customers can expect to take effect immediately as a
result of the new 2014 Farm Bill that has been signed into law are as follows:

The percent of guarantee offered on all Conservation Loans (CL) will increase
from 75 percent to 80 percent. The percent of guarantee will increase to 90
percent for CLs made to socially disadvantaged and beginning farmers.

The interest rate charged on Direct Farm Ownership loans that are made in
conjunction with other lenders is set at two percent below the regular Direct
Farm Ownership rate, with a floor of 2.5 percent.

The requirement for FSA to appraise the value of oil, gas or other minerals to
be used as collateral for Farm Ownership loans has been removed.

The maximum loan amount for down payment Farm Ownership loans increased to
$300,000 from $225,000, consistent with all other Direct Farm Ownership loans.

The rural residency requirement for Youth Loans is removed. Previously, to
qualify for a Youth Loan an applicant had to live in a rural area.

Micro loans made to beginning and veteran farmers and/or ranchers are exempt
from direct term limits. Term limits still apply for non-microloan direct loans
(regular operating loans and Farm Ownership loans).

A limited resource rate is available to beginning and veteran farmers who
receive a Microloan. Borrowers will be given a choice to accept the limited
resource rate or regular operating loan rate.

The restriction that an applicant could receive a Guarantee Operating Loan (OL)
for no more than 15 years has been eliminated.

The definition of a qualified beginning farmer or rancher is modified to set the
average size of farmland owned at no greater than 30 percent of the average size
farm. Previously, this definition used the median farm size which eliminated
many otherwise qualified applicants.

Debt forgiveness will no longer preclude a former Youth Loan borrower from
obtaining additional loans from any U.S. government agency. Additionally,
borrowers with Youth Loan debt forgiveness or who are delinquent on Youth Loan
debt can receive student loans. The servicing and collection of Youth Loans is
not affected by the statute and will continue under the present regulation. FSA
is revising the definition of debt forgiveness to comply with this statute.

Additional information regarding FSA Farm Loans or other FSA programs can be
found by visiting a nearby FSA Service Center or online at fsa.usda.gov

RM8m in loans given to enterprising youths

SECTION: National; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 225 words

DATELINE: Malacca


MALACCA, Sun. - A sum of RM8 million of the total RM20 million allocated
by the Youth and Sports Ministry under its Youth Loan scheme has been
given out to individuals and youth associations.

The ministry's director-general, Raja Roslan Raja Samah, said the scheme
was different from its Youth Economy scheme.

Under this fund which was introduced last year, aspiring youths aged 18
to 40 who wanted to venture into business would not only be assisted
financially but they would also be counselled (by ministry's officers) to
ensure the success of their business.

The allocations had been channelled through BSN Commercial which would
be processing the loans.

Loans under the Youth Economy scheme were handled and processed by the
ministry itself.

Raja Roslan added that a two per cent interest rate would be imposed on
borrowers.

"Through this scheme, the ministry hopes that more youths will become
entrepreneurs," he said after lauching the State-level Youth Programme at
Sekolah Menengah Sultan Mohamed in Batu Berendam today.

Also present were State Family, Youth and Sports Committee chairman
Datuk Noordin Yaani and his deputy, Datuk Hazizah Mohd Sultan.

Raja Roslan said applicants were entitled to loans of between RM5,000
and RM50,000 each, adding that more than 4,000 applications had been
received.

PM's Youth Loan scheme laudable, private sector need make it productive

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 339

LENGTH: 393  words


Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik
appreciating the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme, has called for due
participation of private sector in this process to make these loans more
productive and secured.

"We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best possible use of this
business loan amount,"  Malik said while talking to reporter  here on Tuesday.

For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan
Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed- starting from the main
cities down to the town level in the country.

These boards should have at least one representative of FPCCI or any chamber
associated with FPCCI on the recommendation by FPCCI.

Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and a leading exporter, urged the Government to
divert most of this business loan fund to rural areas of the country to
discourage migration of the rural population to the urban areas in search of
business or employment.

The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their businesses near their
door step. The focus should be on the projects of agriculture, value-addition of
agriculture products, livestock, fish and cattle farming, and other rural based
projects.

He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and workshops in
collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies throughout the country for the
youth interested to start their business through the PM's Youth Business Loan
Scheme. He offered that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the
chambers' premises will be available for these seminars etc.

"It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation and basic
training to these youngsters before providing them with money from the national
exchequer,"  Malik maintained.

He said the private sector will also contribute  to this national cause by
giving apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at their factories and
businesses.

The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent and simple
policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of the use of these loans
so that any possible mis-use be checked.

Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans to students and
called for increase in the amount for each student.

Youth Parliament in Poverty Fight

BYLINE: Ninsiima Innocent

LENGTH: 832  words


The Government of Rwanda is on the verge of reaching its Millennium Development
Goals and the youth have been pivotal in reaching this milestone.

Young people around the country have been encouraged to come together and form
groups as a way of fighting poverty in the country.

One of the most effective projects to impact the lives of the young people is
the Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA) which was started by Rwanda
Youth Parliament (PAJER) with the support of Plan Rwanda in the Eastern Province
of Rwanda.

PAJER is a nonprofit organization founded in January 2000 by a group of Rwandan
youth inspired by a spirit of patriotism to build peace, unity and
reconciliation through honest and frank dialogue and the promotion of integrated
development of the Rwandan population in general and that of Rwandan youth in
particular.

"The idea of the founders was based on the terrible history of the country
characterized by atrocities and poor governance practices.

Thus the Rwandese youth today and the population in general need a peaceful
society characterized by respect of human rights, mutual confidence, unity,
reconciliation and sensitization on self reliance and active participation in
integrated sustainable development of their country," says Patrick Karangwa, the
Executive Director of PAJER.

"By training youth throughout the country in critical thinking skills,
independent research, integrated developing solutions to current societal
problems, and the effective argumentation of these proposed solutions in a
debate format, their needs are met to ensure sustainability and self reliance,"
adds Karangwa.

The Rwanda Youth Parliament partnered with Plan Rwanda to form groups that save
money in the form of shares. The savings are invested in a loan fund, from which
members can borrow money and must repay the interest.

Their primary purpose is to provide simple savings and loan facilities in a
community that does not have access to formal financial services. Loans can also
provide a form of self-insurance to members, particularly if they are
supplemented by a social fund to provide small but important grants and no-cost
loans to members in distress.

Jacqueline Nyarakira is a 20-year-old student who benefited from the project.

"I had lost hope in my life. I did not know what to do since I had not gone to
school. I joined this project and got a small loan.

I started selling wheat and I bought a goat. Today, I have a bull and I am
planning to buying a cow," she says.

Vianney Karalare is another happy youth who has no regrets about joining the
project.

"I got a loan and bought iron sheets for my house. I also bought myself a
mattress and now I live like a King," he says.

Emmanuel Ntagungira, the Programmes Director at the Rwanda Youth parliament said
the youth are able to strike a balance between creating a useful pool of capital
within their communities. Associations meet one day a week as the members agree.

"Associations are autonomous and self managing, basing their system of
governance, policies, and operating procedures on a written constitution," he
said.

Ntagungira also emphasized the importance of accountability where all
transactions are carried out at meetings in the presence of all members. Money
collected is stored under lock and key in a cashbox.

"This promotes transparency and accountability and prevents corruption due to
unauthorized cash movement and the risk of record tampering. The cashbox has
three keys each of which is kept by different members of the General Assembly,"
Ntagungira explains.

"The cycle of savings and lending is time bound. At the end of an agreed period,
the accumulated saving and service charge earnings are shared out among the
members.

"This is critical for transparency and the confidence of all members. A cycle
must not last for more than one year to share out.

All members have an individual passbook. This is necessary to permit varying
rates of savings and to track member's loans and liabilities," Ntagungira
further elaborates.

In February 2011, the first bunch of youth graduated from the VSLA project and
55 percent of the graduates were girls trained in entrepreneurship.

The graduation that took place at Kiramuruzi in the Eastern Province was
attended by over 2000 youths. The Chief Guest was the Minister of Youth, Protais
Mitali.

Mitali applauded encouraged people to start solving their problems and the youth
should be at the forefront of these solutions.

"The youth are the pillars of the nation and their efforts are important in
nation building," Mitali said.

Currently the project covers the districts of Kiziguro, Murambi and Kabalore.

Olive Bohojengedo is a 32-year-old mother with four children who has benefited
from this project.

"I was illiterate and I had so many challenges as a single mother. I was taught
saving skills and today, my children go to the best schools here and are very
healthy," she said.

Within two years 1800 youths will be enrolled in the project as a way of
fighting poverty.

LENGTH: 477  words


Honorary Chairperson of the Prime Minister's Youth Programme Maryam Nawaz on

the youth from "dependents" to "providers."

Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the PM's Youth Business Loans Programme
here, she said that the programme consist of six schemes including Business
Loans Programme, Micro Interest Free Loans Programme, Skill Development
Programme, Fee Reimbursement for Deserving Students Programme and Training
Programme.

She said that 55 project pre-feasibilities had been prepared and were available
on SMEDA's website.

However, if the applicant had his/her own business plan, that too would be
acceptable for participation in the awarding process.

The National Bank of Pakistan and the First Women's Bank have been strictly
directed to ensure complete transparency and merit, she added.

She said that it had been a settling political culture in the past that loud
promises were made with the youth which were never materialized.

"But the PML-N government is here to remind the youth about its promises it had
made during election campaign," she added.

"You reposed confidence in Nawaz Sharif and voted for the PML-N, now it's time
to fulfil those promises," she said, adding that they had been continuously
working during the last six months over the youth oriented programmes.

She said that she had heard the Prime Minister during meetings always advocating
for the cause of youth.

"He always referred to the youth as our future investment and building blocks,"
she added.

Maryam said with such initiatives they wanted to bring smiles on the faces of
youth so that they could also financially support their families.

She also thanked the Prime Minister for reposing confidence in her and assured
to fulfil her responsibility with full potential.

"The PM entrusted me with the responsibility of empowering our youth and I
gladly accepted because investing in youth is equal to investing in Pakistan's
development," she added.

Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar said that when they went for polls in the last
general election, the country was facing serious challenges with broken economy.

He said they had made promises with masses and it was the first promise being
fulfilled by the Prime Minister himself by announcing the inauguration of loans
programme.

He also asked the private financial banks and institutions to come forward and
play their due role in lending support to young lot of the country.

He said under the government's austerity drive, Prime Minister's discretionary
funds had been abolished.

He said transparency, merit, good governance and zero tolerance were the
hallmarks of their election manifesto which had been adhered to strictly.

He said in the shortest period of time, the country had taken strides earning
good rating among the international financial institutions.

LENGTH: 860  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz
Sharif Friday said his government was resolved to eliminate
unemployment, poverty and illiteracy from the country through
youth-oriented projects by channelizing potential of youngsters,
consisting majority of the population.
      Addressing a ceremony to mark the first balloting of the
aspirants of Prime Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme, the
Prime Minister said the government desired to expand the said
scheme to the extent that the country gets rid of unemployment.


      He said around Rs 3.70 billion would be disbursed among
5,399 applicants declared successful through the first balloting.
      The ceremony was also attended by Minister for Finance
Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Pervaiz
Rashid, Chairperson PM Youth Business Loan, Maryam Nawaz, Cabinet
members, Chairman and President of National Bank of Pakistan,
besides thousands of youngsters, coming from across the country.
     The Prime Minister said in the past, the banks had restricted
their loan facilities to the influential people, ignoring around
90 percent of the population, what could change country's future
likewise all developed nations.
      He said the poor population faced neglect in the past despite
having qualification, expertise and dedication as all they lacked
were the resources. However, the government would help their dream
come true through such schemes, he added.
      Nawaz Sharif said his announcement for youth loan scheme
during the electioneering was not a political notion, rather it
was his strong commitment to ensure access of this segment of
society to national resources.
      He said small and medium enterprises always lead the national
economy but in Pakistan, the youth welfare always remained confined
to words only.
      "We will change the lives of the people. Though changing fate
lies with God, someone has to become sources for this in this world,"
he added.
      He told the gathering that the country's economy was heading
positively with investment increased by 5 percent, tax recovery
enhanced by 17 percent till January this year and industrial growth
by 6.6 percent till December last.
      He said the government had to take tough decisions in the
initial days that begot inflation because the previous governments
had done nothing to address energy crisis and other grave issues.
      He said the load-shedding has been reduced remarkably and
vowed to end the same as various energy projects were underway
to cope with country's energy requirements till year 2025 by
generating around 25,000 megawatts.
      The Prime Minister said work on Karachi-Lahore Motorway
would be started very soon where phased construction of
Lahore-Multan, Sukkur-Multan and Sukkur-Hyderabad sections would
be carried out.
      He hoped the youth would come forward by starting their own
businesses in various sectors which would not only support their
families but also create jobs opportunities for others.
      He said around 28000 applications were received from Punjab,
3,000 from Sindh, 3,500 from KPK, 1,000 from Balochistan, 600 from
Islamabad, 500 from AJK and 100 from Gilgit Baltistan.
      He said out of the processed 6000 applications, 5399 would
be balloted and the successful candidates would be informed
through SMS.
      He said the volume of loans to a particular province would
not surpass the provincial quota and for year 2013-14, the
government has targeted 100,000 applicants to disburse loans.
      He urged the people from all provinces, particularly women,
to come forward for taking part in national development and apply
for the loan to exploit the allocated limit for their respective
provinces.
      The gathering was told that the balloting has been carried
out among the male applicants from Punjab as they outnumbered the
set allocated quota as rest of the applications from other
provinces was far lower than the quota.
      The Prime Minister said out of 38,000 total applications
received by the banks, comprised 31,000 men and 7,000 women and
majority of them was aged between 21 to 30 years.
      Later, the Prime Minister carried out the balloting by
pressing a computer key.
      Addressing the gathering, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said
the country's economy suffered due to uneven distribution of
resources in the past as the youth population was never made
partner in national development.
      He said State Bank has directed all commercial banks to
divert their resources to PM's Youth Loan Scheme. If they tilt
only 10 percent of country's total loan portfolio worth Rs 5,000
billion, the youth would get around Rs 500 billion loan, he
added.
      Referring to the government's steps to improve national
economy, he said a survey carried out by a Japanese organization
revealed that Pakistan would be the choicest place within next
few years. A renowned economic Jim O'neil also forecast Pakistan
as 18th biggest economy by year 2050.
      President NBP Syed Ahmed Iqbal and Chairman NBP Munir Kamal
also addressed the gathering and highlighted various aspects of
the Youth Loan Scheme.
      The ceremony also marked the performance of Youth Ambassador
Nadeem Abbas along with his team.

Pakistan: Govt to eliminate unemployment, poverty through youth-oriented
projects: PM

LENGTH: 866  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, March 1 -- Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz

Sharif Friday said his government was resolved to eliminate

unemployment, poverty and illiteracy from the country through

youth-oriented projects by channelizing potential of youngsters,

consisting majority of the population.

Addressing a ceremony to mark the first balloting of the

aspirants of Prime Minister Youth Business Loan Scheme, the

Prime Minister said the government desired to expand the said

scheme to the extent that the country gets rid of unemployment.

He said around Rs 3.70 billion would be disbursed among

5,399 applicants declared successful through the first balloting.

The ceremony was also attended by Minister for Finance

Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Pervaiz

Rashid, Chairperson PM Youth Business Loan, Maryam Nawaz, Cabinet

members, Chairman and President of National Bank of Pakistan,

besides thousands of youngsters, coming from across the country.

The Prime Minister said in the past, the banks had restricted

their loan facilities to the influential people, ignoring around

90 percent of the population, what could change country's future

likewise all developed nations.

He said the poor population faced neglect in the past despite

having qualification, expertise and dedication as all they lacked

were the resources. However, the government would help their dream

come true through such schemes, he added.

Nawaz Sharif said his announcement for youth loan scheme

during the electioneering was not a political notion, rather it

was his strong commitment to ensure access of this segment of

society to national resources.

He said small and medium enterprises always lead the national

economy but in Pakistan, the youth welfare always remained confined

to words only.

"We will change the lives of the people. Though changing fate

lies with God, someone has to become sources for this in this world,"

he added.

He told the gathering that the country's economy was heading

positively with investment increased by 5 percent, tax recovery

enhanced by 17 percent till January this year and industrial growth

by 6.6 percent till December last.

He said the government had to take tough decisions in the

initial days that begot inflation because the previous governments

had done nothing to address energy crisis and other grave issues.

He said the load-shedding has been reduced remarkably and

vowed to end the same as various energy projects were underway

to cope with country's energy requirements till year 2025 by

generating around 25,000 megawatts.

The Prime Minister said work on Karachi-Lahore Motorway

would be started very soon where phased construction of

Lahore-Multan, Sukkur-Multan and Sukkur-Hyderabad sections would

be carried out.

He hoped the youth would come forward by starting their own

businesses in various sectors which would not only support their

families but also create jobs opportunities for others.

He said around 28000 applications were received from Punjab,

3,000 from Sindh, 3,500 from KPK, 1,000 from Balochistan, 600 from

Islamabad, 500 from AJK and 100 from Gilgit Baltistan.

He said out of the processed 6000 applications, 5399 would

be balloted and the successful candidates would be informed

through SMS.

He said the volume of loans to a particular province would

not surpass the provincial quota and for year 2013-14, the

government has targeted 100,000 applicants to disburse loans.

He urged the people from all provinces, particularly women,

to come forward for taking part in national development and apply

for the loan to exploit the allocated limit for their respective

provinces.

The gathering was told that the balloting has been carried

out among the male applicants from Punjab as they outnumbered the

set allocated quota as rest of the applications from other

provinces was far lower than the quota.

The Prime Minister said out of 38,000 total applications

received by the banks, comprised 31,000 men and 7,000 women and

majority of them was aged between 21 to 30 years.

Later, the Prime Minister carried out the balloting by

pressing a computer key.

Addressing the gathering, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said

the country's economy suffered due to uneven distribution of

resources in the past as the youth population was never made

partner in national development.

He said State Bank has directed all commercial banks to

divert their resources to PM's Youth Loan Scheme. If they tilt

only 10 percent of country's total loan portfolio worth Rs 5,000

billion, the youth would get around Rs 500 billion loan, he

added.

Referring to the government's steps to improve national

economy, he said a survey carried out by a Japanese organization

revealed that Pakistan would be the choicest place within next

few years. A renowned economic Jim O'neil also forecast Pakistan

as 18th biggest economy by year 2050.

President NBP Syed Ahmed Iqbal and Chairman NBP Munir Kamal

also addressed the gathering and highlighted various aspects of

the Youth Loan Scheme.

The ceremony also marked the performance of Youth Ambassador

Nadeem Abbas along with his team

Govt has opened new avenues for youth: PM

SECTION: Vol. 15 No. 336

LENGTH: 1342  words


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Saturday said that the government has
opened new avenues for the youth to stand on firm footings.

Addressing an inaugural ceremony of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loans
Programme here, he said that in the past, no one was willing to extend loans to
about 110 million youth, while on the other hand, the big groups and companies
were making most of these facilities.

"The youth wants to do something for the country. But such sorry state of
affairs with deprivation in store for the youth, remained a contradictory aspect
of the past," he lamented.

The Prime Minister referring to youth's role in the economies of Japan, Germany,
South Korea, Malaysia and US said that their major GDP, economic, SMEs and
industrial growth were mainly dependent upon this segment of society.

"If they are the backbone of their economies, then this segment of society can
also take Pakistan to acme of progress and prosperity," he added.

The Prime Minister recollecting his election campaign said that it had pained
him greatly when he witnessed educated unemployed youth who were neglected and
never cared about.

"They were deprived of basic necessities of life but I have seen sparkling hope
in their eyes. In the past five years, we have endeavoured to do something for
them, for carving a path to their bright future," he added.

He said earlier loans were available for the rich, it was only his government
that initiated the revolutionary scheme to provide loans to the youth.

He regretted that no previous government bothered to look after the 110 million
youth of the country and it was only his PML-N government that took the decision
to bring them into the national mainstream.

Regretting the dismal economic growth and faulty policies of the previous
governments, the Prime Minister said the present government wanted to take the
country on the path to rapid progress and end the financial degradation which
had roots in the nationalization policies of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's regime during
1970.

He said during his first term in power, he tried to reverse the negative trend
by privatizing the banks and other state run industrial units and said that it
was because of these steps that the banks today were doing good business and
making huge profits.

"When I was the Prime Minister during 1990s, we went on privatizing the MCB,
UBL, HBL, Allied Bank etc and turned the tide, making these banking institutions
as profit earning entities and enabling them to pay huge taxes to the
government," he added. The Prime Minister said that he did not want to mention
those people who made Pakistan a scapegoat for their vested interests.

Highlighting the priorities of his government to strengthen the economy, he said
that in the past six months, they had taken major steps to continue
privatization of those government entities, including the PIA, which had been
incurring losses to tune of millions of rupees.

"It is not the job of the government to run factories or hotels rather
government wants to eradicate terrorism, improve law and order situation, end
sectarianism and take steps with prudence in the right direction," he noted.

He said without maturity in politics, they could not steer the country out of
such challenges.

He said due to their drastic measures, the respect of the green passport would
be restored soon.

Informing a gathering of youth hailing from all over the country including AJK,
FATA and Gilgit Baltistan, the Prime Minister said that during his visit to US,
he was asked by the US leadership during meetings as to what they could do for
Pakistan, but he told them clearly that he had not come with a begging bowl
rather he wanted opening of avenues for Pakistani products.

"They were surprised to hear that it was for the first time that a Prime
Minister from Pakistan was asking for such things," he added.

Welcoming the positive criticism, he said that good intentions of the government
should not be unjustly criticized.

He said when the prices of tomatoes and onions were increased a huge hue and cry
was raised but when it were brought down to Rs 40 no one mentioned it on TV.

He said those who had played havoc with the country's economy in the last ten
years should be asked as to why they had not taken steps to end load shedding
and improve Karachi law and order situation.

"The country during the last decade had earned name in corruption only but with
our transparent policies, you have also read in newspapers, the country's image
has improved a lot," he added.

He said when the PML-N won a thumping majority in the last general election, he
made up his mind to accept the daunting challenges.

The Prime Minister said during election campaigns, he had witnessed the vigour
and enthusiasm that the youth showed and he had pledged that the government
would empower the youth of Pakistan so that they could contribute effectively
towards development of the country.

Responding to applause of crowd of young people, the

Prime Minister said "No one, even myself would have the authority to influence
the loan award process."

Youth would have 8 years payback time with first year grace period for
re-payment, he added.

"It is not my quota, it belongs to deserving children of Shuhada, 50 per cent
for girls and 50 per cent for boys," he added.

He said the  authorities concerned of the National Bank

of Pakistan and the First Women's Bank Limited would have to decide the
eligibility of the applicants.

He further said that Rs 100 billion has been

allocated for this programme during the current financial year and in the first
phase 100,000  unemployed youth would be given loans through ballot.

He said that he desired that the amount of Rs 100 billion allocated for the
purpose should have been increased benefiting all the applicants but the country
was facing real financial constraints in the energy sector.

The Prime Minister said that there would be complete transparency in the award
of loans and an effective monitoring mechanism has been evolved to keep a check
on loan award process so that merit was ensured.

Expressing his optimism for bright future of the youth, the Prime Minister said
that the loans programme would benefits 100,000

families and the beneficiaries would be able to employ at least five other
persons in their business.

He asked the youth to reciprocate in the befitting

manner the trust which he had reposed in them by excelling in the business
field, earning for themselves and making their families proud.

"I have reposed confidence in you, spend this amount in transparent manner and
also return within due time limit.  We have to earn money through hard work and
the youth will earn for us," he added.

He said contrary to bank interests on loans which stood around 25 per cent, they
would have to pay only 8 per cent per annum with one year as grace period while
7 per cent would be borne by the government. He informed that the government was
also launching low-cost housing units.

The Prime Minister asked the gathering to pray for their mission which was aimed
at bringing smiles to downtrodden strata of the society and leading the country
towards path of prosperity.

The Prime Minister said that the government was committed to head towards the
destination of prosperity by launching major power generating projects in
assistance of China and Turkey.

He said they had been burning midnight oil to implement these major projects,
including Diamer-Bhasha and Bunji dams with capacity of 15,000 MW, Nuclear Power
project in Karachi with power generation capacity of 2200 MW besides, Gadani and
the agreements on Kashghar-Gwadar Economic Corridor and setting up special

PM's Youth Loan scheme laudable, private sector need make it productive

LENGTH: 404  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik appreciating the Prime Minister's
Youth Business Loan Scheme, has called for due participation of
private sector in this process to make these loans more productive
and secured.


    "We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best
possible use of this business loan amount,"  Malik said while
talking to media here on Tuesday.
     For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loan Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed--
starting from the main cities down to the town level in the country.
  These boards should have at least one representative of FPCCI or
any chamber associated with FPCCI on the recommendation by FPCCI.
     Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and a leading exporter,
urged the Government to divert most of this business loan fund to
rural areas of the country to discourage migration of the rural
population to the urban areas in search of business or employment.
     The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their
businesses near their door step. The focus should be on the projects
of agriculture, value-addition of agriculture products, livestock,
fish and cattle farming, and other rural based projects.
     He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and
workshops in collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies
throughout the country for the youth interested to start their
business through the PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme. He offered
that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the chambers'
premises will be available for these seminars etc.
    "It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation
and basic training to these youngsters before providing them with
money from the national exchequer,"  Malik maintained.
     He said the private sector will also contribute  to this national
cause by giving apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at
their factories and businesses.
     The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent
and simple policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of
the use of these loans so that any possible mis-use be checked.
     Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans
to students and called for increase in the amount for each student.

Ministry threatens defaulting youths with court action

BYLINE: Regerai Tukutuku

LENGTH: 395  words


Thousands of Zanu (PF) youths who borrowed money from the government's youth
fund during the run up to the 2013 elections risk being dragged to court after
the ministry of youth, indigenisation and economic empowerment gave them an
ultimatum to settle the debts in full.
Christopher Mushowe

According to government sources the youths borrowed money ranging from $800 -
$1000, but most of them have not repaid back a single cent.

In a letter dispatched to all provinces by the ministry, now headed by former
Manicaland governor Christopher Mushowe, the youths were ordered to pay  back
their outstanding areas before the end of this month or risk court action.

The loans recovery manager in the ministry, Collins Chikukwa , has since written
letters to all the provinces demanding that all outstanding loans be paid on or
before July 20 this year.

In a letter dated May 28 and copied to all the country's provinces Chikukwa said
" We demand the balance in full on or before July 20 2015 or risk legal action.
No payment plans would be entertained after this date and those who will have
defaulted will be issued with summons".

In what was viewed as a campaign gimmick, hordes of Zanu (PF) youths were given
loans from the youth fund administered by the ministry during the run-up to the
2013 polls. The fund is meant to assist youths in order for them to embark on
development projects, irrespective of their political affiliation. However it
has been turned into a Zanu (PF) project,  with youths aligned to President
Mugabe and his ruling) party being the sole beneficiaries.

Although Mushowe could not be reached for comment, government sources said the
treasury - which is almost empty - was trying to strengthening ways of
recovering all monies owed to the state by companies and individuals.

"Government has no money and is leaving no stone unturned in making sure that it
recover every cent from its debtors, "said a government source. However some of
the youths said they would not pay back the loans because they do not have the
money.

"Where does the government think we are going to get the money to pay back the
loans?" asked one of the youths, who preferred to be anonymous. "We are just
waiting for the court action and we will defend ourselves in court because some
of us were given the funds on the understanding that it would not have to be
paid back," he added.

finance schemes were catalysts for politico-economic development while micro
credit was an instrument of change for the poorest segments of the society,
especially women.

"Such schemes further boost productive economic activities in the country," the
premier said and added that he was convinced that if youth were given proper
guidance and financial support through micro credit schemes and better access to
innovative technology, they could play a positive role in the country's
development.

salient features of the scheme. She said with the approval of the loan, the
government had fulfilled another promise of the prime minister made with the
youth.

youth.

She told the premier that the government had earmarked Rs3.5 billion for
interest-free loans for targeted beneficiaries, which will be disbursed through
the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund. Each federating unit has been given share
as per the NFC Award with the primary focus on rural areas.

Each beneficiary will receive up to Rs50,000 through the interest-free loan
scheme and one million people will benefit. A proper loan centre and business
support centre will be formed to facilitate the beneficiaries.

Maryam further told the premier that the training of selected youth under the PM
Youth Skill Development Programme had commenced from May 12, 2012 in which
25,000 youths from the less developed areas of the country will be imparted
training in 100 disciplines. The duration of the training programme is 4-6
months for various disciplines and it will cost Rs800 million.

Maryam Nawaz told the PM that the PM Fee Disbursement Scheme would benefit
approximately 33,000 eligible students during the current financial year. The
students doing M. Phil and PhD from 59 districts will avail themselves of the
tuition fee and other education charges. The government will cover all the
expenses, she said.

Maryam said all MS, M Phil and PhD scholars of public sector universities would
be eligible and there will be a special quota for the disabled. The students
would be selected upon their performance, she said. Bright students of
polytechnic institutions will also be eligible.

Youth loan scheme

BYLINE:  Muhammad Pathan - Turbat

SECTION: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Vol. LXVII No. 357

LENGTH: 189  words


THE prime minister's youth loan scheme is for the rich. If we consider the terms
and conditions, this scheme is certainly not for the poor.

The premier and his daughter said that loan was for helping the poor to work and
run their homes. Who says it is for the poor? From where the poor can get
guarantor to secure this loan?

The government is in a fix on how to provide this loan to eligible youths. Under
the scheme, 100,000 youths will be given out loans at subsidised interest rate
of 8pc. Is it helping or taking more money from the poor?

The poor can afford to lose such a huge amount. Unless the government is ready
to share losses, how can we risk our depositors and money? If the needy youths
join the scheme, they should demand two things: the guarantor should be made
liable to pay the defaulted amount, and the government should share losses to
the banks.

Distributing money to the youth isn't a good policy. Instead, the government
should help set up industry and enable youths to get jobs opportunity. If the
government is serious about launching such a scheme, it should ensure the poor
can afford to take advantage of it.

LENGTH: 632  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday approved Rs3.5 billion
interest-free loan scheme, which will cater to one million people across the
country. Fifty percent of the beneficiaries would be women. Disbursement of
loans would start in the third week of June this year.



The approval was announced in a meeting held at the Prime Minister's House that

last month.

Federal Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Federal Secretary for
Finance Dr Waqar Masood Khan and senior officials concerned attended the
meeting.Maryam has kick-started her activities afresh pertaining to her gigantic
plans to help the needy across the country.

Reviewing the progress of the interest-free loan scheme, the premier said micro
finance schemes were catalysts for politico-economic development while micro
credit was an instrument of change for the poorest segments of the society,
especially women.

"Such schemes further boost productive economic activities in the country," the
premier said and added that he was convinced that if youth were given proper
guidance and financial support through micro credit schemes and better access to
innovative technology, they could play a positive role in the country's
development.

Chairperson Prime Minister Youth Scheme Maryam Nawaz briefed the premier on the
salient features of the scheme. She said with the approval of the loan, the
government had fulfilled another promise of the prime minister made with the
youth.

She said transparency and merit were the hallmarks of the programme and they
believed in disbursing the capital and imparting skills for the development of
youth.

She told the premier that the government had earmarked Rs3.5 billion for
interest-free loans for targeted beneficiaries, which will be disbursed through
the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund. Each federating unit has been given share
as per the NFC Award with the primary focus on rural areas.

Each beneficiary will receive up to Rs50,000 through the interest-free loan
scheme and one million people will benefit. A proper loan centre and business
support centre will be formed to facilitate the beneficiaries.

Maryam further told the premier that the training of selected youth under the PM
Youth Skill Development Programme had commenced from May 12, 2012 in which
25,000 youths from the less developed areas of the country will be imparted
training in 100 disciplines. The duration of the training programme is 4-6
months for various disciplines and it will cost Rs800 million.

Maryam Nawaz told the PM that the PM Fee Disbursement Scheme would benefit
approximately 33,000 eligible students during the current financial year. The
students doing M. Phil and PhD from 59 districts will avail themselves of the
tuition fee and other education charges. The government will cover all the
expenses, she said.

Maryam said all MS, M Phil and PhD scholars of public sector universities would
be eligible and there will be a special quota for the disabled. The students
would be selected upon their performance, she said. Bright students of
polytechnic institutions will also be eligible.

The premier was told that Haier Electrical Appliances, the company which got the
contract, will assemble 10,000 laptops in Pakistan and from next year 100pc of
the laptops to be distributed will be assembled in Pakistan. Every laptop will
have an EVO device with three months of free internet connection. The company
will also offer internships to selected students. The company will establish
E-education rooms in two universities where 14 softwares will be installed free
of cost. Distribution of the laptops will start in June.

Businessman calls for private sector participation

LENGTH: 432  words


Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik has
called for due participation of private sector for making the Prime Minister's
Youth Business Loan Scheme very successful and role model for the future.

"We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best possible use of this
business loan amount," Malik said while talking to media here. Malik also
offered that the applicants who are granted this loan will be provided short
trainings and orientation at the private sector's facilities/ industries to make
these loans very productive and help the educated youth to emerge as successful
businessmen of the country.

"It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation and basic
training to these youngsters before providing them with money from the national
exchequer," Malik maintained.

For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan
Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed starting from the main
cities down to the town level in the country. These boards should have at least
one representative of FPCCI or any chamber associated with FPCCI on the
recommendation by FPCCI.

Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and leading exporter, urged the Government to
divert most of this business loan fund to rural areas of the country to
discourage migration of the rural population to the urban areas in search of
business or employment.

The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their businesses near their
door step. The focus should be on the projects of agriculture, value-addition of
agriculture products, livestock, fish and cattle farming, and other rural based
projects.

He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and workshops in
collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies throughout the country for the
youth interested to start their business through the PM's Youth Business Loan
Scheme. He offered that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the
chambers' premises will be available for these seminars etc.

He said the private sector will also contribute to this national cause by giving
apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at their factories and
businesses. The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent and
simple policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of the use of these
loans so that any possible misuse is checked.

Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans to students and
called for increase in the amount for each student.

Azerbaijani youth to get mortgage loans

BYLINE: Aynur Karimova

LENGTH: 527  words


To purchase a house is one of the most important decisions in the life of all
families in Azerbaijan which requires a huge sum of money. However, lack of
necessary funds is the major problem for the youth particularly those living in
the capital Baku.

In this case a bank loan is considered as the most acceptable solution to the
problem. To this end, Azerbaijan's Youth and Sports Ministry has made all
efforts to increase the funds allocated for social mortgage and to increase the
number citizens to be provided with such a type of mortgage.

Speaking at a press conference on January 28, Intigam Babayev, Deputy Youth and
Sports Minister said the youth, engaged in science, will also be provided with
social mortgages.

"This, first of all, is related with their salaries. However, the resent
statement of the Central Bank gives hope that the ideas recently proposed in
this field have already been implemented," Babayev noted.

The main goal is to resolve the housing and unemployment of youth as part of the
Strategy of development of the Azerbaijani youth in 20152025, approved by
President Ilham Aliyev.

In Azerbaijan, the maximum amount of mortgage loans provided via the Azerbaijan
Mortgage Fund makes up 50,000 manats with a rate of eight percent and maturity
term of 25 years. The social mortgage loan is issued in the amount of 50,000
manats with an annual rate of four percent and for a term of 30 years.

The initial payment to receive the social mortgage is 15 percent, while the
figure is 20 percent for a conventional loan.

The loan is allocated in national currency, manat and the beneficiaries should
be the Azerbaijani citizens.

Mortgage is given only for an apartment or private house and its amount should
not exceed 80 percent of the market value of the property. The monthly payment
for a loan must not exceed 70 percent of the monthly income of the borrower, who
should also produce an agreement on life insurance.

Martyrs families' members, families of National Heroes of Azerbaijan, internally
displaced persons, civil servants with an experience of not less than three
years, people with Ph.D., persons who have special merits in the sport, as well
as military service with a minimum period of three years will enjoy some
preferable conditions.

Each family who has the right to a lax mortgage loan can receive it only one
time.

So far, the AMF has given 15,400 mortgage loans.

Currently, 28 of the total 44 local banks are authorized banks of AMF.
Meanwhile, some 21 of the existing 27 insurance companies and 15 appraisal
organizations are the main players of the mortgage market.

As of February 2015, the families wishing to buy a house with mortgage loans
will be able to apply online for a mortgage loan.

This will be possible thanks to the 'Online mortgage' portal (www.eipoteka.az),
which will operate since February 2.

The new service will facilitate the Azerbaijani citizens to get a loan, increase
the transparency of mortgage loan's allocation, as well as strengthen the
control system of the fund.

The Azerbaijani government has significant financial resources. It plans to
increase the volume of financing of mortgage loans in the coming years.

Businessman calls for private sector participation

SECTION: Vol. XXXVII No. 346

LENGTH: 433  words


Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik has
called for due participation of private sector for making the Prime Minister's
Youth Business Loan Scheme very successful and role model for the future.

"We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best possible use of this
business loan amount," Malik said while talking to reporter here.

Malik also offered that the applicants who are granted this loan will be
provided short trainings and orientation at the private sector's facilities/
industries to make these loans very productive and help the educated youth to
emerge as successful businessmen of the country.

"It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation and basic
training to these youngsters before providing them with money from the national
exchequer," Malik maintained.

For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan
Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed- starting from the main
cities down to the town level in the country.  These boards should have at least
one representative of FPCCI or any chamber associated with FPCCI on the
recommendation by FPCCI.

Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and leading exporter, urged the Government to
divert most of this business loan fund to rural areas of the country to
discourage migration of the rural population to the urban areas in search of
business or employment.

The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their businesses near their
door step. The focus should be on the projects of agriculture, value-addition of
agriculture products, livestock, fish and cattle farming, and other rural based
projects.

He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and workshops in
collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies throughout the country for the
youth interested to start their business through the PM's Youth Business Loan
Scheme. He offered that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the
chambers' premises will be available for these seminars etc.

He said the private sector will also contribute to this national cause by giving
apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at their factories and
businesses.

The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent and simple
policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of the use of these loans
so that any possible mis-use be checked.

Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans to students and
called for increase in the amount for each student.

BYLINE: by Richard Hotter, FLM

LENGTH: 572  words


The Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers loans for farmers and ranchers to purchase

help producers who are temporarily unable to obtain private or commercial
credit. In many cases, applicants are beginning farmers who have insufficient
net worth to qualify for financing through a commercial lender. In other
instances, borrowers might have suffered setbacks from natural disasters or
might be persons with limited resources.

Farm ownership loans or farm operating loans may be obtained as direct loans for
a maximum of up to $300,000. Guaranteed loans can reach a maximum indebtedness
of $1,094,000. Emergency loans are always direct loans for fanners who may have
suffered physical or production losses in disaster areas designated by a
Presidential or Secretarial disaster declaration. Rural youth loans, loans to
beginning farmers and loans for socially disadvantaged applicants are also
available through FSA.

For detail information loan eligibility or the different available loan
programs, just contact the county office staff for an appointment with a farm

direct Farm Ownership Loan rate, but not lower than 1.5 percent.

Pakistan: Businessman calls for private sector participation

LENGTH: 471  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


KARACHI, Dec. 20 -- Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
Iftikhar Ali Malik has called for due participation of private sector for making
the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme very successful and role model
for the future.

"We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best possible use of this
business loan amount," Malik said while talking to Right Vision News here. Malik
also offered that the applicants who are granted this loan will be provided
short trainings and orientation at the private sector's facilities/ industries
to make these loans very productive and help the educated youth to emerge as
successful businessmen of the country.

"It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation and basic
training to these youngsters before providing them with money from the national
exchequer," Malik maintained.

For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan
Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed starting from the main
cities down to the town level in the country. These boards should have at least
one representative of FPCCI or any chamber associated with FPCCI on the
recommendation by FPCCI.

Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and leading exporter, urged the Government to
divert most of this business loan fund to rural areas of the country to
discourage migration of the rural population to the urban areas in search of
business or employment.

The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their businesses near their
door step. The focus should be on the projects of agriculture, value-addition of
agriculture products, livestock, fish and cattle farming, and other rural based
projects.

He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and workshops in
collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies throughout the country for the
youth interested to start their business through the PM's Youth Business Loan
Scheme. He offered that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the
chambers' premises will be available for these seminars etc.

He said the private sector will also contribute to this national cause by giving
apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at their factories and
businesses. The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent and
simple policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of the use of these
loans so that any possible misuse is checked.

Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans to students and
called for increase in the amount for each student

PM youth loan may face fate of Yellow Cab Scheme

BYLINE:  Salman Abduhu

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 311

LENGTH: 560  words


Keeping in view the plight of some previous schemes such as Yellow cab Scheme,
the Prime Minister's present youth loan programme also seems a totally flop
scheme, as no practical step has been taken or detailed homework has been done
to make this project result-oriented.

This loan programme despite having excellent features has several loopholes,
which must be removed to make the loan scheme successful, observed Dr Muhammad
Azam Roomi, Director Research - CWE, Bedford Shire University UK. The global
expert on entrepreneurship and enterprise development facilitator was speaking
at a capacity building programme arranged by the Lahore Economic Journalists
Association here on Tuesday. Roomi, who is on a visit to Pakistan, said that
success of this scheme could push the GDP growth rate up if it was planned on
long-term basis, besides attracting more investment and bringing down crimes
graph, as it is already experienced in dozens of countries. Terming the scheme
as positive, he stressed the need for taking some practical steps to make it a
success. He said that youth should be guided and educated on how they could
better utilize the loan for personal development.

He said that the government should have developed a long-term policy for these
loans as results could not be achieved in one year. "The one-billion-dollar
question in Pakistan these days is - how to make the PM Youth Business Loan
Scheme successful. On the other hand, the government has already imposed
strenuous, stringent and severe conditions for the guarantors by making them
`jointly and severally liable' for the defaulters.

There's no doubt that in Pakistan, with the absence of venture capital funding
culture and collateral free loans, both the micro-finance scheme and small and
medium enterprise scheme have potential to create enterprise development
opportunities contributing to the overall economic development. However, one
must not forget the plight of similar schemes in other parts of the world and
even in Pakistan where such loans did not reach the deserving. "All over the
world, the success of public sector business loan schemes depend upon an
"integrated approach", which consists of enterprise development skills, business
support provision and creativity and innovation development as pre-requisites
for applying and getting these loans approved.

The integrated approach serves two purposes: first, it acts as a filter to
identify the genuineness and readiness of potential youth to take the
entrepreneurial leap; second, it enables these young people to plan their
business effectively and efficiently by minimizing the failure risks." Welcoming
Roomi, LEJA President Ashraf Mehtab threw light on the objectives of the
Association and Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme. Dr Azam Roomi said
that globally, majority of businesses fail in the first three years of their
existence. One of the most cited reasons is improper planning. Although SMEDA is
offering a template on their website about how to develop a business plan,
however, first item in the template states: "A business plan is not required for
PM's youth business loan scheme". "The first question which comes to my mind is
how will lenders decide about the viability and success of the potential
business? Are we going towards yet another scandal of sub-prime lending," he put
the question.

"integrated approach", which consists of enterprise development skills, business
support provision and creativity and innovation development as pre-requisites
for applying and getting these loans approved.

The integrated approach serves two purposes: first, it acts as a filter to
identify the genuineness and readiness of potential youth to take the
entrepreneurial leap; second, it enables these young people to plan their
business effectively and efficiently by minimizing the failure risks." Welcoming
Roomi, LEJA President Ashraf Mehtab threw light on the objectives of the
Association and Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme. Dr Azam Roomi said
that globally, majority of businesses fail in the first three years of their
existence. One of the most cited reasons is improper planning. Although SMEDA is
offering a template on their website about how to develop a business plan,
however, first item in the template states: "A business plan is not required for
PM's youth business loan scheme". "The first question which comes to my mind is
how will lenders decide about the viability and success of the potential
business? Are we going towards yet another scandal of sub-prime lending," he put
the question.

Businessman calls for private sector participation

LENGTH: 436  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik has called for due participation of
private sector for making the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan
Scheme very successful and role model for the future.


    "We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best
possible use of this business loan amount," Malik said while
talking to media here.
    Malik also offered that the applicants who are granted this loan
will be provided short trainings and orientation at the private
sector's facilities/ industries to make these loans very productive
and help the educated youth to emerge as successful businessmen of the
country.
    "It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation
and basic training to these youngsters before providing them with
money from the national exchequer," Malik maintained.
    For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loan Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed--
starting from the main cities down to the town level in the country.
These boards should have at least one representative of FPCCI or
any chamber associated with FPCCI on the recommendation by FPCCI.
    Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and leading exporter,
urged the Government to divert most of this business loan fund to
rural areas of the country to discourage migration of the rural
population to the urban areas in search of business or employment.
    The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their
businesses near their door step. The focus should be on the projects
of agriculture, value-addition of agriculture products, livestock,
fish and cattle farming, and other rural based projects.
    He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and
workshops in collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies
throughout the country for the youth interested to start their
business through the PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme. He offered
that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the chambers'
premises will be available for these seminars etc.
    He said the private sector will also contribute to this national
cause by giving apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at
their factories and businesses.
     The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent
and simple policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of
the use of these loans so that any possible mis-use be checked.
   Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans
to students and called for increase in the amount for each student.

CABS Suspends Youth Loan Scheme

LENGTH: 464 words


The Central African Building Society (CABS) has suspended disbursing loans under
the Youth Development Fund (YDF) due to a high default rate of 78 percent,
Parliament heard yesterday.

A subsidiary of Old Mutual, Cabs is the disbursing agent of the $10 million YDF
which the parent firm availed as part of its compliance with the indigenisation
and empowerment laws.

The financial institution has received around 22 000 applications since the fund
was launched two years ago and had disbursed $5 million to fund 3 600 projects.

Cabs managing director, Kevin Terry told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee
on Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment that the fund targeted youths
between 18 and 35 years, was not performing well with the allocation criteria
set to be reviewed.

"The trustees (of the YDF) have asked us to suspend doing more loans since May,"
Mr Terry told the Committee chaired by Gokwe-Nembudziya legislator, Justice
Mayor Wadyajena.

"The last disbursements were done in May and the funds are just sitting at
Cabs."

Mr Terry said lack of business management skills was the main reason for the
high default rate as most youths were allocated funds without having undergone
any capacity building programmes.

"It will be better if the fund was linked to vocational training centres, that
way we will be lending to someone who has been given some training," the Cabs
boss said.

He said a number of projects were performing well although the majority were
struggling.

Another bank, CBZ which has disbursed $2,3 million to youths under the
government driven programme also told the committee it was facing compliance
challenges with beneficiaries.

CBZ Holdings group chief executive Never Nyemudzo said the default rate for its
youth facility was 45 percent.

"The performance has generally been very good with a default rate of 45 percent
which means 55 percent of the beneficiaries have been able to pay back their
loans," he said.

Defaults were mainly by beneficiaries in the cross border, manufacturing and
poultry business, he said.

"The major reasons for this default have been to do with management and general
unwillingness to payback the loans," he said.

CBZ Bank managing director Peter Zimunya said the default rate was not bad
considering the money was lent to inexperienced youths.

"On normal business the rate of 45 percent is very bad but we are trying to
empower the youths," he said.

"When we train them, it should come down. The normal default level for a bank is
around five percent."

The youth fund was set up to support income generating programmes to uplift the
livehoods of youths in the face of economic challenges and unemployment in the
country.

Committee members expressed concern on skewed lending which appeared to favour
big cities and towns. -- New Ziana.

Youth startups find the road to repaying seed capital bumpy

BYLINE: JEREMIAH KIPLANG'AT jkiplangat@ke.nationmedia.com -1

LENGTH: 352  words


Some beneficiaries of the youth fund are having difficulties repaying their
loans and now want a friendlier way to settle the debt.

The youths said they are facing many challenges in stabilising their fledgling
enterprises, making repayment difficult even though they are willing to service
their loans.

Mr Jeremiah Kahutia, for instance, got a Sh1 million loan last year from the
Youth Enterprise Development Fund and invested in pigs and sheep.

Although he said he was willing to settle the loan in time, it has been
difficult to do so because his business is taking longer than expected to
mature. He is now forced to use other earnings to pay back the money.

"My business has failed to take off fast enough. I have been forced to turn to
other earnings to repay the loan," Mr Kahutia said.

Another beneficiary, Ms Ann Ndirangu, said she had started repaying the loan but
her businesses - M-Pesa shops, gas refilling centres, and agent banking outlets
in Thika - are facing cut-throat competition.

"There are several similar businesses coming up next to mine yet there were none
when I got into these ventures," she said. She now fears that her loan repayment
schedule might be hindered.

Entrepreneurial skills

Ms Catherine Namuye, the acting chief executive of the fund, acknowledged the
difficulties youths were facing but said they were willing to listen to them and
strike common ground on a friendlier formula to offset the loans.

She said the fund was aware of the problems young businesses, especially those
operated by youth without entrepreneurial skills, may experience and were
willing to talk with them to agree on how to repay the loans.

"If they could talk with the board, we would be able to listen to them and see
how we could help them," she promised.

Another hurdle, Ms Namuye noted, is the inability of business owners who get
past the age of 35 years to continue with their ventures. She noted that many
such enterprises were run down after their proprietors got past this age because
the owners could not find other ways of financing them.

The fund is only available to youth between 18 and 35 years.

Rs 12 billion have been allocated for Waseela-e-Haq programme: Farzana Raja

SECTION: Vol. VII No. 159

LENGTH: 541  words


The Sindh Government and the Benazir Income Support Program have jointly
launched 'Wasela-e-Haq Programme' for self-employment of educated youth of the
province by providing soft and interest-free loan of Rs 0.3 million each. Sindh
Government has allocated Rs 12 billion for this revolutionary program initiated
and directed by President Zardari. This initiative would be supported and
executed within the system of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). The
President would hold balloting for this purpose on Friday (Jan. 27), said
Chairperson of BISP, Madame Farzana Raja during the signing ceremony of this new
programme, here at the Chief Minister House on Thursday.

This process would be completed within next one or one and a half month, she
said. The soft-ware for this purpose is ready. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Qaim
Ali Shah, Sindh Ministers including Syed Murad Ali Shah, Agha Siraj Durrani,
Haji Muzzaffar Shujra, Madame Shazia Atta Marri also witnessed the ceremony.
Madame Farzana Raja said that under the first phase, around 35,000 youth would
be given the loan from a pool of half million youth through balloting. One year
would be given as the grace period and the re-payment of the loan would start in
the second year. The loan would be provided after re-verification of the
successful applicants in the balloting that they have no other source of income
or job. It is possible that the names of such youth are included in this poop of
half million sorted out from the data available with BISP, but later they would
have been able to get a job. "Only after re-verification of the status of
un-employed youth, we would issue the cheque of loan," he The youth eligible for
this loan should be of 19 to 35 years age group with minimum qualification of
matriculation.

The applicants should not have other source of income. The purpose of this
programme is to support those families who were in genuine need of employment
and livelihood. Both male and female would be covered. They would also be
provided short training so that they could successfully do their businesses, she
said adding that this program is technology based. Madame Farzana Raja said that
this would Union Council based to ensure equal support to the people of Sindh.
She said that this programme would be expanded in future and more youth would be
covered as there is a large number of educated un- employed youth in the
province , like in other areas of the country. She also informed that another
programme named 'waseela-e-taaleem' in pipeline under the PISP. Sindh Chief
Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah said that providing loan to around 35,000 youth
would actually support at least 0.25 million people besides generating indirect
employment especially in remote areas.

He said the PPP-led government has spent Rs 100 billion on different programmes
of poverty alleviation and socio-economic uplift of the people in the province.
Earlier, Sindh Minister for Finance Syed Murad Ali Shah said that President Asif
Ali Zardari had directed Sindh Government and BISP to start the 'Wasela-e-Haq'
programme within ten days. We demanded 15 days. But today is 9th day , we did
our job, he explained. He said this entire process would be very transparent and
merit based.

Prof Latigo to youth: Get loans for a purpose

BYLINE: MARTIN ODONG -1

LENGTH: 238  words


The Managing director Gulu Uganda Country Dairy, Mr Tonny Kidega, tasked the
youth to make the use of the unutilised land in the region.

Gulu-  Former leader of Opposition in the 8th Parliament Morris Ogenga Latigo
has advised youth in Acholi sub-region to desist from securing loans from banks
without clear business plans.
While addressing 200 youth at the Acholi youth business Advocacy Forum at Bomah
hotel in Gulu Town at the weekend, prof Latigo said many youth are being forced
to take unsecured loans from unscrupulous financial service providers who have
instead deepened the debt cycle.
"Some youth after securing loans from the institution because they have no plans
on what to do, divert the cash to alcohol, sports betting and  marriage in terms
of bride price," said prof Latigo.
Failure to pay
"At the end of the day, when the time comes for paying back the loans, the youth
get into hiding," he added.
The Managing director Gulu Uganda Country Dairy, Mr Tonny Kidega, tasked the
youth to make the use of the unutilised land in the region.
"Our generation looks at farming as the job of uneducated but that is not the
case. We are tasking fellow youth to change their attitudes towards this for
self sustainability," Mr Kidega said.
"You need to save and be more responsible with your finances. We need a culture
of savings. You can't earn Shs100,000 and keep spending Shs110,000," he added.

Plan to train Bumi youths in business

SECTION: National; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 323 words

DATELINE: Alor Star


ALOR STAR, Tues. - The Youth and Sports Ministry will seek the assistance
of the Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia to help
formulate programmes which can instil a business culture among Bumiputera
youths.

Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said today that many Bumiputera youths
who had ventured into business with loans provided through the ministry's
schemes did not have the basics in business and the problem needed to be
tackled.

"We found many of them unexposed even to the basics in business and
trading and these factors have affected their business ventures."

He said the ministry hoped the chamber could organise seminars and
courses for the youths.

"The youths could also be gathered at luncheons and dinners where
successful entrepreneurs could deliver talks."

He said the chamber could also at a later stage, expand their roles to
encourage youths to venture into franchise business.

Muhyiddin said he had discussed the matter with Federal Territory Malay
Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman Datuk Mohamed Izzat Emir
recently and saw no problem in implementing the programme.

"We will go to the chamber in other States to seek their assistance
after this," he said after delivering a talk on the ministry's "Tabung
Kumpulan Wang Amanah Pembangunan Ekonomi Belia" to about 300 youths at the
Youth and Sports Complex.

On the fund, he said the ministry would be more stringent with the
repayment of loans.

He said the loan scheme was stopped and relaunched last year because
repayments were very poor.

"About 40 per cent of those who had obtained loans through this scheme
paid their dues and we will have to make sure those who obtained loans
after the relaunch are not late in repayments."

Muhyiddin said unlike previously where borrowers were required to start
repaying their loans after six months, the ministry had extended the grace
period to a year.

Cabs Youth Fund Revived

BYLINE: Kudzai Kuwaza

LENGTH: 397 words


THE Central African Building Society (Cabs) youth fund, which was suspended
early this year, will soon be fully operational after discussions with the
government, Indigenisation minister Francis Nhema has said.

Cabs managing director Kevin Terry told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on
Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment early this year that the
suspended fund, which targets youths between 18 and 35 years, had underperformed
with a loan default rate of 78%.

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday Nhema said the Cabs youth fund would
resume full operations but with recommendations that those youths who benefit
from the fund will need collateral or a guarantor to avoid a repeat of the high
default rate by youths that prompted its suspension.

"It (Cabs youth fund) is up and running but we are doing it in stages," Nhema
said.

He said that in an effort to recover the loans given to youths by Cabs, the
ministry has asked the various provisional officers to follow up on the loans.
In some cases, Nhema revealed, they have rescheduled the loans and in other
cases have asked parents of the defaulters to help them recoup money.

Nhema said they will not take any of the defaulters to court.

"We have not taken them to court. We do not want to be harsh on them. It is a
learning process," Nhema said.

The minister said that only one bank has not complied with the indigenisation
requirements.

He said the ministry is currently studying the indigenisation compliance
proposals of the remaining financial institution.

Nhema said he had no problem with investors that have acquired more than the
stipulated 49% shareholding in local companies particularly banks.

Mauritius-based Afrasia Bank Ltd has increased shareholding in Afrasia Zimbabwe
Holdings Ltd to 62,5% with majority takeovers of Tetrad Investment Bank and Banc
ABC. He said the investors have a five year period in which to eventually comply
with the indigenisation laws.

Nhema said during the outreach programme by his ministry to the 16 operational
Community Share Ownership Trusts, they had emphasised the need for the trusts to
embark on programmes that will benefit the nation as a whole.

He said the country will host the meeting of Sadc ministers responsible for
youth to be held between Tuesday and Friday at the Victoria Falls where a number
of issues affecting youth in southern Africa will be discussed.

Youths seek softening of Prime Minister's loan scheme criteria

SECTION: Vol. XLIX No. 336

LENGTH: 407  words


Youth seeking support from Prime Minister's loan scheme demanded simplification
of the procedure and criteria of the scheme to enable large number of people to
take benefit of the offer. The programme has broad canvas of schemes enabling
youth and poor segments of population to get good opportunities of employment,
economic empowerment, acquiring skills needed for gainful employment, spreading
use of computers and imparting on-the-job training for young graduates to
improve the probability of getting a productive job.

Under the Prime Minister's Youth Programme a loan ranging from Rs 0.1 million to
Rs 2 million has been offered to youth with age from 21 years to 45 years at the
mark-up rate of eight percent. The loan would be recovered in a period of eight
years in equal monthly instalments.

The fund would be disbursed in the youth on soft terms and conditions and
instead of employees it would help turn them into employers. The youth are
jubilant and taking keen interest in the scheme and the visiting of the large
number of youth for seeking information is ample proof of that tremendous
response. Dozens of youth have been witnessed visiting the special desk
established in the Regional Office, Small and Medium Enterprise Development
Authority (SMEDA).

Talking to this scribe, a youth Mohammad Imran though appreciated a good scheme
for the empowering of the youth. However, he called for the creation of
awareness in the people and further softening of the terms and conditions of the
scheme. He complained that the criterion of the scheme is not clear who can take
benefit of the scheme while the residents of the far-flung areas are totally
ignorant of it. He urged the government for the devolution of the scheme from
provincial level to district level and removal of the doubts from the hearts of
the youth.

Ahmad Gul, another youth, said he is anxiously desirous for taking benefit of
the scheme; but, he has no gazetted officer in his family. He said due to such
difficult terms and conditions potential youth would fail in taking benefit from
the scheme. He also stressed need for the softening of the criterion to enable
the youth of poor and middle class families to take benefit of it. A young woman
entrepreneur also complained of the strict terms and conditions for the
guarantors in the scheme. She said as compared to men, women would face more
difficulties in finding guarantor for obtaining the loan from the scheme.

BYLINE: Norma Siame

LENGTH: 335 words


GOVERNMENT yesterday disbursed more than KR1.1 million from the Youth
Development Fund in loans to 47 youth groups in Northern Province.

This is part of the KR19.1 million earmarked for distribution this year.

Youth and Sport Minister Chishimba Kambwili said Government had put in motion an
awareness campaign and mechanism to publicise the fund to allow youths in the
remotest parts of the country access the facility.

He was speaking when he Presented the cheques at the Pastoral Centre in Kasama
yesterday.

"I am happy that all districts in the province including the latest, Nsama, have
a fair share and have accessed the fund. It is commendable as the fund is not
just for urban youths but all Zambians, regardless of locality and status," Mr
Kambwili said.

Other provinces need to emulate Northern and ensure equitable distribution of
the fund among all districts to enable integration of the youth in national
development.

The minister also disbursed KR130,000 grants to three groups as an economic
empowerment initiative.

He, however, warned the loan recipients that had been given the opportunity to
participate in Zambia's development would be held liable if they failed to
repay.

"We shall not hesitate to bring you to book so that you can serve as an example
to other youths who may be harbouring intentions to defraud the Government of
hard-earned resources," Mr Kambwili.

Mr Kambwili encouraged loan recipients to meet their obligations through making
necessary loan repayment installments on their due dates to allow other youths
benefit from the fund.

In a vote of thanks, a recipient and proprietor of SIPES Foods and Catering
Services Peter Siame commended the Patriotic Front Government for availing means
for youths to convert local resources into opportunities for development.

"I wish to urge my fellow youth that it is imperative that these loans be paid
back so other youths after us benefit from this glorious opportunity," he said.

The province had recommended 49 projects out which 47 were approved.

Remove Hurdles to Land, Loan Acquisition - Nigerian Youths

LENGTH: 402 words


Youths in Nigeria have raised their voices to the hurdles created by the
stringent conditions attached to land and loans acquisition for farming
activities by banks.

Speaking at the second edition of Youth Summit on Agriculture in Abuja, the
youths, some of whom are farmers listed demands for high standing guarantors,
which include directors in ministries, top politicians and wealthy businessmen,
is discouraging and has kept many of them from participating in agriculture.

They also cited challenges to acquisition of legitimate lands with approved
papers and substantial loans for farm equipment as other factors that have kept
many youths in the country away from farming.

News Agency of Nigeria quoted young entrepreneur, Paul Nwadike, as saying that
many banks requested unattainable documents to dissuade young entrepreneurs in
agriculture.

"We have been asked severally to float cooperatives in order to gain access to
the loans approved for us in commercial banks but the processes are too rigorous
for us.

"The bank even asked me to provide my mother's birth certificate which is very
difficult to do; they demand such impossible things to make sure we don't get
loans," he said.

Nwadike also called for unity farmlands where the government could acquire
specially for youths across the country to encourage increased youth
participation in farming.

Another young farmer, Sanni Abdulhakeem, said many banks used the impression
that young farmers are "start-ups" to refuse them loans.

Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, who
responded to these complaints assured the young farmers that negotiations were
ongoing to address these challenges.

"We are still talking and appealing to banks that although they are dealing
excellently with agro-dealers through the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme,
they should also consider real and young farmers.

"The ministry is not resting on its oars to ensure the disbursement of every
fund approved by the Federal Government to Nigerian farmers including young
farmers," Adesina said.

Represented by Efuntoye Ademola, a director in the minister's office, Adesina
said that the president had approved N50 billion fund for mechanisation, and
urged youths to key into the programme.

Similarly, Special Adviser to the President on Ethics and Values, Mrs. Sarah
Jibrin, urged youths in Nigeria to display maturity and good conscience when
granted loans.

Corruption rocks youth fund

BYLINE: Tawnda Majoni/ Kenneth Matimaire

LENGTH: 526  words


Provincial youths have accused senior government officials at the Ministry of
Youth headquarters of fraud over the allocation of the $10 million national
youth fund.

The youths say the officials are replacing provincial applicants with their kith
and kin from Harare when approving the final list of applicants to receive
loans. They also accuse them of taking advantage of their position to re-assess
all the applicants from the 10 provinces before making the final selection.

"Our provincial youth officers have no power. The Harare office re-assesses
applications that have already been approved by provincial youth officers. This
is being  manipulated to our disadvantage," said Onai Ndemera from the National
Youth Services.  "The senior officers are replacing our applications with those
from youths based in Harare contrary to the youth policy."

Ndemera pleaded with Youth  Minister Francis Nhema to give provincial youth
officers authority to have the final say over applications from their respective
areas. This would bring transparency into the allocation process and reduce the
waiting period, he said.

His views were reiterated by many participants during the Youth Consultative
Forum and Expo held on Thursday at Mutare Hall. Youths urged the parent ministry
to do away with the bureaucracy over the processing of fund applications.  Nhema
ensured them he would get to the bottom of the matter.

Nhema told The Zimbabwean his ministry had been monitoring the performance of
the loan beneficiaries. "We are not happy with their performance because only 30
percent have managed to honour the terms of repaying their loans. We need to do
a lot of work to ensure that the fund runs properly," he said.

Youths defaulting on the fund, which is managed by Old Mutual and distributed by
the Central African Building Society (CABS), could face lawsuits.

"We have already sent out 1,300 letters to remind the youths to repay their
loans as expected. In the event that they totally default, usual business
procedures will apply," said Nhema.

Buying cars

Reports indicate that a substantial number of the youths (18-35 years), who
received loans ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, converted the money to other
purposes such as buying cars instead of developing the projects for which they
were given the funds. Others abandoned the projects mid-way due to incapacity to
run them.

"While there is need to capacitate the youths, it seems many of them did not
appreciate that a lot was required for them to succeed in business. Their
projects were not well thought out and there are indications that some of them
lacked requisite skills," added the minister.

As a result, future beneficiaries will be required to produce vocational
certificates and evidence of the capacity to embark on proposed ventures before
being allocated money. He accused the youths of failing to understand that the
money they were receiving was from a revolving fund.

Nhema admitted that there had been a poor uptake of the funds, and said the
government would only assist willing beneficiaries.  But despite the problems
bedevilling the fund, government intends to double the money to $20 million.

LENGTH: 511  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, June 6 -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday said that those
who were not willing to work should let him do his job.

Taking a dig at Imran Khan's PTI he said "how will you run a country when your
are not able to run a province".

Addressing a ceremony related to Business Youth Scheme, he said that the people
had given him an opportunity in the last year general election. "Now opponents
by respecting people's opinion should let me work".

"It is the time for work not to hold dharanas and my government has proved this
through inauguration of Nandipur power project within the short time of seven
months.

Nawaz Sharif said that he had welcomed those who received mandate in KP, Sindh
and Balochistan.

Addressing the second computer balloting for grant of loans under Prime
Minister's Youth Business Loans here on Wednesday Prime Minister Nawaz expressed
the confidence that the youth securing loans for businesses would prove to be a
harbinger of social and economic revolution in the country..

The Prime Minister said in the first phase 38,000 applications for loans were
received under PM Youth Business Loans including 31,000 men and 7,000 women.

Of them, 6000 were selected for grant of loans through computer ballot in the
first draw and 6000 more are being selected through second draw.

The Prime Minister said those getting loans would not only be able to launch
their own business but also provide job opportunities to others.

The Prime Minister said the programme is not meant for any specific area or
region but is being implemented all over the country in a transparent manner.

The Prime Minister said the government has also launched Qarz-e-Hasna scheme,
which would benefit 250,000 families next year. He said there would be 50 %
share for women in the scheme.

He said the scope of the youth training scheme is being increased to cover
50,000 youth who would get one year training in different trades.

Nawaz Sharif said this is the time for taking practical steps for resolving
problems of the people and not to go for sit-ins. He said those who could
succeed in 2013 elections should wait for 2018 general elections.

He said the Government has launched a number of development projects and is
completing them in record time. The Prime Minister said 35 billion dollar would
be invested in power, road and railway sectors during the next ten years.

He said 21,000 megawatt of electricity would be added to the national grid in
eight to ten years.

Speaking on the occasion, Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar said the present
government is focusing on welfare of the down trodden sections of the society
and launching of six youth related schemes are part of that strategy of PML-N.

Meanwhile, Balochistan Board of Revenue has set up Provincial Surveillance Cell
for verification of revenue record for getting loan under Prime Minister's Youth
Business Loan

Pakistan: Businessman calls for private sector participation

LENGTH: 464  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


KARACHI, Dec. 18 -- Vice President, SAARC Chamber of Commerce

and Industry, Iftikhar Ali Malik has called for due participation of

private sector for making the Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan

Scheme very successful and role model for the future.

"We are the businessmen. We can better guide for the best

possible use of this business loan amount," Malik said while

talking to media here.

Malik also offered that the applicants who are granted this loan

will be provided short trainings and orientation at the private

sector's facilities/ industries to make these loans very productive

and help the educated youth to emerge as successful businessmen of the

country.

"It would be more proper and productive to first give orientation

and basic training to these youngsters before providing them with

money from the national exchequer," Malik maintained.

For better and safe utilisation of the Prime Minister's Youth

Business Loan Scheme, Malik suggested that boards should be formed--

starting from the main cities down to the town level in the country.

These boards should have at least one representative of FPCCI or

any chamber associated with FPCCI on the recommendation by FPCCI.

Malik, who is also the former president Federation of Pakistan

Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) and leading exporter,

urged the Government to divert most of this business loan fund to

rural areas of the country to discourage migration of the rural

population to the urban areas in search of business or employment.

The youth should be guided and facilitated to start their

businesses near their door step. The focus should be on the projects

of agriculture, value-addition of agriculture products, livestock,

fish and cattle farming, and other rural based projects.

He called upon the Government to hold seminars, presentations and

workshops in collaboration with the chambers and trade bodies

throughout the country for the youth interested to start their

business through the PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme. He offered

that FPCCI Head Office and its zonal offices besides the chambers'

premises will be available for these seminars etc.

He said the private sector will also contribute to this national

cause by giving apprenticeship to these would-be businessmen youth at

their factories and businesses.

The senior businessman called for strict checks and transparent

and simple policy and procedures for sanctioning and monitoring of

the use of these loans so that any possible mis-use be checked.

Malik also praised the Government's scheme for giving loans

to students and called for increase in the amount for each student

Recently Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif inaugurated business loan scheme
for youth with the ray of hope to open new avenues for unsettled, unemployed and
jobless youth of our homeland. In his address to the youth, prime minister said:
through business loan we want to empower our youth to contribute their positive

Minister assured that step have been taken particularly for youth because they
are the bright future of Pakistan.

But with this great opportunity, the shock came when it was learnt that business
loan facility came with 8% markup which is unjustified, wrong and absolutely
against the teaching of Islam. But soon, it was taken notice of and some
amendments in the scheme were announced to make it more acceptable.

If the government is really interested for the welfare and betterment of youth
as well as prosperity of the dear homeland, it should make the loan scheme
totally interest free. Those who are getting loans need to be given succor and
relief, instead of tying them with a heavy loan which in order to be paid back -
may ultimately drain a good part of their life.

Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday approved the interest-free loan
scheme worth Rs. 3.5 billion, which will cater to one million people in the
country, with fifty percent of the beneficiaries to be women.

The disbursement of the interest-free loans would start in the third week of

The loan-scheme was approved by the Prime Minister during a review meeting of
the loan scheme.

Minister for Finance, Ishaq Dar, Chairperson Prime Minister's Youth Scheme
(PMYS), Ms. Maryam Nawaz, Secretary Finance, Dr. Waqar Masood and other senior
government officials attended the meeting.

The Prime Minister on this occasion said that micro finance schemes were
catalysts for political and economic development while micro credit was an
instrument of change for the poorest segment of the society, especially women.

Such schemes further boost the productive economic activities in the country, he
added.

The Prime Minister was convinced that if the country's youth were given proper
guidance and financial support through micro credit schemes and better access to
innovative technology, they could play their positive role in development of the
country. Chairperson Prime Minister's Youth Scheme, Maryam Nawaz briefed the
Prime Minister.

She said, "Today we have fulfilled another promise of Prime Minister of Pakistan
made with the youth of Pakistan." She said, "Transparency and merit are hall
mark of our programme and we believe in disbursing capital and imparting skills
for development of our youth."

She told the Prime Minister that the Government has earmarked Rs. 3.5 billion
for the interest-free loan for the target beneficiaries' from all over the
country, which will be disbursed through Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund. Each
federating unit has been given share as per the NFC Award with the primary focus
on rural areas, she added.

The Prime Minister was told that each beneficiary will receive up to Rs 50,000
through the Interest Free Loan Scheme and one million people will get the
benefit from the scheme.

Proper Loan Centers and Business Support Centers will be set up to facilitate
the beneficiaries.

Maryam also briefed the Prime Minister on the progress of other programmes of
the PMYS.

She told the Prime Minister that training of selected youth in the Prime
Minister Youth Skill Development Programme has commenced from May 12, under
which 25,000 youth of the lesser developed areas from all over the country will
be imparted training in 100 disciplines. The duration of training programme is
4-6 months for various disciplines and will cost Rs. 800 million. 35% quota has

Rule of law to be ensured at all levels: Nawaz

BYLINE:  Baqaul Mohsin

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 313

LENGTH: 483  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that rule of law is panacea to all problems
and the PML-N government wants to ensure it at all levels.

The prime minister said this in his address to the applicants of Youth Business
Loan Scheme at Bahawalpur. Had the rule of law been followed and enforced in
Pakistan, the country would not have faced a lot of problems, he said, adding,
"Our religion also teaches us the same."

Nawaz Sharif said the loan scheme was not a political slogan but a fulfillment
of the promise to the youth of Pakistan. "I have started this scheme as a
national cause and only economic and development interest of the country has
urged me to start this scheme," the PM added.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the youth of the country remained neglected and
it was time that their real potential was utilised for the benefit of the
country. Such schemes should have been started at the time of inception of
Pakistan, he opined. He asserted the developed countries like Germany, Japan and
the US had made their youth self-reliant.

The prime minister said: "We have to trust our youth and want to give them
financial independence so that they could play their positive role in the
economy of the country and utilise this loan productively." Nawaz Sharif said
that, previously, the loans were given only to influential people and small loan
applicants were neglected. "We have decided to give loans to small borrowers in
order to benefit skilled youth and lower strata of the society. This will not
only benefit small borrowers but also their families and those to be employed in
their projects. Despite financial hardships, the government has been able to
allocate Rs 100 billion for the scheme," PM said.

The prime minister further said: "We have ensured transparency at every level in
the government and it is heartening to say that not a single corruption case has
been reported in our six-month tenure." He said in such a short tenure positive
effects on the economy are evident to all. He kept on saying that though
loadshedding had not been completely controlled, still statistics show that it
is much less as compared to the situation last year. In order to completely end
loadshedding, the government has planned to build Diamer-Bhasha Dam, Bunji and
Dasu hydro power projects, but these are long-term projects and will produce
results in 8 to 10 years, he pointed out.

Later, the prime minister interacted with youth loan applicants and enquired
from each of them about their plans after getting the loan. The applicants were
enthusiastic to find the prime minister amongst them and said the loan scheme
would help them exploit their skills not only for their benefit but also for
their families and society at large. Federal Information, Broadcasting and
National Heritage Minister for Senator Pervaiz Rashid and other senior
government officials were also present on the occasion.

Kilifi self-help groups get Sh16m business loans

BYLINE: REBECCA OKWANY

LENGTH: 350  words


83 groups received Sh13, 550,000 under the WEF, while eight women and two youth
groups received Sh590, 000.


More than 100 self-help women and youth groups in Kilifi have received
Sh16million worth of enterprise loans from the government.
Eighty three groups received Sh13, 550,000 under the Women Enterprise Fund
(WEF), while eight women and two youth groups received Sh590, 000.


The cheques were presented to the groups by Public Service, Youth and Gender
Affairs Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki at separate ceremonies in Kilifi town
and in Ganze constituency on Friday.
In Ganze, 42 groups received loans totalling Sh3million for their businesses.
"To reduce gender violence in Kilifi, it is important that youth, men and women
are financially stable,'' said Ms Kariuki.
"These gender violence cases on women commonly occur when they are unable to
sustain themselves," she added during the ceremony at Karisa Maitha stadium.
The CS praised Kilifi residents for taking up government loans and repaying them
in a timely manner, stressing that since the inception of the various group
loans Sh400million has been disbursed in the county.
In his remarks, Kilifi County Commissioner Joseph Keter said that lack of
employment among youth in the county and poverty has contributed to insecurity
as those affected engage in criminal activities to survive.
Kilifi County secretary Owen Baya speaking on behalf of Amason Kingi who was in
Rabai on official duties, urged women and youth groups to apply for 'Mbegu Fund'

  which also supports young people, women and people with disability to finance
their businesses.
The day was also marked by testimonies from various groups who have benefitted
from loans by the government.

work should let him do his job.

Taking a dig at Imran Khan's PTI he said "how will you run a country when your
are not able to run a province".

Addressing a ceremony related to Business Youth Scheme, he said that the people
had given him an opportunity in the last year general election. "Now opponents
by respecting people's opinion should let me work".

"It is the time for work not to hold dharanas and my government has proved this
through inauguration of Nandipur power project within the short time of seven
months.

Nawaz Sharif said that he had welcomed those who received mandate in KP, Sindh
and Balochistan.

Addressing the second computer balloting for grant of loans under Prime
Minister's Youth Business Loans here on Wednesday Prime Minister Nawaz expressed
the confidence that the youth securing loans for businesses would prove to be a
harbinger of social and economic revolution in the country..

The Prime Minister said in the first phase 38,000 applications for loans were
received under PM Youth Business Loans including 31,000 men and 7,000 women.

Of them, 6000 were selected for grant of loans through computer ballot in the
first draw and 6000 more are being selected through second draw.

The Prime Minister said those getting loans would not only be able to launch
their own business but also provide job opportunities to others.

The Prime Minister said the programme is not meant for any specific area or
region but is being implemented all over the country in a transparent manner.

50,000 youth who would get one year training in different trades.

problems of the people and not to go for sit-ins. He said those who could
succeed in 2013 elections should wait for 2018 general elections.

completing them in record time. The Prime Minister said 35 billion dollar would
be invested in power, road and railway sectors during the next ten years.

Mariental Youth Benefit From Credit Scheme

BYLINE: Hilmah Hashange

LENGTH: 377 words


A total of 25 youths in Mariental were the recipients of small business loans
from the Namibia Youth Credit Scheme.

Established in 2005 by the Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sport and
Culture, the Namibia Youth Credit Scheme (NYCS) is a youth empowerment programme
which caters for youth between the ages of 18 to 35.

The programme aims to promote the livelihoods of youth through employment
creation and generation of income through enterprise development.

Although the programme was piloted in the four regions of central northern parts
of the country, the NYCS was later replicated in the Hardap region in 2011 and
now operates in all 14 regions country wide.

According to the Employment and Training Youth Officer in the NYCS secretariat,
Maria Ekongo, the programme provides a five-day training in basic business
management where the youth have to develop their business plans which are then
appraised to determine whether their businesses are viable and require loans.

"The programme operates through a lending methodology where by beneficiaries are
required to be in groups of three to five people. After starting up their
businesses, follow up training, counselling and monitoring is offered. The
beneficiaries also have access to other products after graduating from the
initial phase," Ekongo said.

Since the establishment of the programme in Hardap, 347 youths were trained and
243 beneficiaries received loans. A total of N$901 000 was allocated to the
youth of Hardap region since 2011, resulting in 166 enterprises being
established and 150 jobs created.

During 2014, a total of N$157 000 was distributed among youth in Mariental,
Hoachanas, Maltahohe and Aranos. In Mariental alone, 25 beneficiaries received
loans worth N$55 000 ranging from N$ 2 000 to N$4 000. The loans will be used as
start-up capital for small businesses and will also be used as a supplement for
existing small business.

The beneficiaries of 2014 formed part of the training that took place at the
Mariental Youth Resource Centre in 2013 and their business appraisals were
conducted in June 2014. The implementing agency in Mariental is Namibia Rural
Development Project.

Gov't Reviews Conditions for Youth Funds

BYLINE: Henry Sekanjako

LENGTH: 417 words


Government has revised some of the stringent conditions that were set for the
youth to access the sh25b youth Enterprise Venture capital fund.

Parliament recently tasked the finance ministry to explain why the youth fund
has been tagged with stringent conditions, which the legislators said would
hinder the intended beneficiaries from accessing the money.

Appearing before the Parliament's committee on gender, labour and social
development on Tuesday, finance Minister Maria Kiwanuka said government had
revisited some of the stringent conditions to enable all intended beneficiaries
access the funds.

The minister said they had scrapped off a condition that requires beneficiaries
to present their O' level certificates of education before accessing the money.

"We have decided to soften some of the terms to make the fund more accessible by
the youth," Kiwanuka said.

She noted that the ministry was in consultations with the banks responsible for
handling the loans to consider giving out loans of up to sh10m to a group of two
people rather than the five that was proposed in the earlier terms and
conditions.

She added that government had also revised the age bracket for accessing the
youth fund from 25 to between 18 and 35 to enable all the youth access funds.

Kiwanuka explained that a toll free hotline and customer care center had been
established by the responsible banks to help the youth address their complaints
regarding the youth.

She said banks will be monitoring all the youth groups that will have got the
loans by giving quarterly reports on loans highlighting who has borrowed, how
much and how their loans would be progressing.

However lawmakers asked the ministry to consider revising other conditions such
as the interest rates to a much lower rate than the proposed 15 % rate.

The MPs also want Centenary and DFCU banks that are responsible for handling the
youth enterprise capital fund to extend mobile banking facilities to rural areas
to enable the youth in such areas access the funds without covering long
distances.

They also proposed that government identifies established SACCOS in rural areas
through which money can be channeled for the youth to access.

Meanwhile, the committee chaired by MP for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)
William Nokorach also queried the sh16b part of the 44.5b youth fund that was
given to Kampala Capital City Authority for developing markets in Kampala.

He argued that it should have been split to cover other municipalities and not
Kampala alone.

Youth Fund loan amount to be raised

BYLINE: By Sajahan Waheed

SECTION: National; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 512 words

DATELINE: Kuala Lumpur


KUALA LUMPUR, Thurs. - The Youth and Sports Ministry is to increase the
minimum loan provided under the Youth Economic Fund for young
entrepreneurs from RM50,000 to RM100,000, Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin
Yassin said today.

He said the move was aimed at providing young entrepreneurs with the
opportunity to expand their businesses.

"However, this does not mean that all applicants would be given loans of
up to RM100,000 because there are certain conditions which must be met
first," he said.

Muhyiddin was speaking after attending a briefing for youth
representatives on the programme.

The RM100 million fund is open to Malaysians between 18 and 40 years
old. Established in May 1988, it provides youngentrepreneurs with the
means to obtain loans to start or develop businesses.

It was relaunched in March this year with a new approach making it more
flexible and simple. Those who obtain loans can repay them within a
maximum period of 10 years with an added rate of two per cent interest per
annum.

About 25,000 young entrepreneurs are expected to benefit from the fund
under the Seventh Malaysia Plan where RM20 million would be loaned to
5,000 youths every year for a period of five years.

"Among conditions that they need to meet in order to apply for RM100,000
is that they should have obtained an earlier loan and settled all the
repayments. The second loan application should be for expanding an already
established business."

Muhyiddin said 75 of the 1,720 applicants provided with money under the
programme had defaulted on their loans and that his ministry would be
taking action against them which included taking the defaulters to court.

"Previously we were not very serious and rather lenient but perhaps it
is time we adopted a more serious stand to overcome the problem," he said.

He said the ministry intended to develop the programme as a revolving
fund so that the money paid back could be used to help other interested
youths.

Muhyiddin also said the ministry would implement a computer learning lab
franchise programme soon which would be conducted at 200 centres
throughout Malaysia.

"The RM10 million programme will be open to all youths and will provide
them with administrative training and computer usage to enable them to
become successful entrepreneurs," he said.

In his speech, Muhyiddin said entrepreneurship would continue to be an
important factor in maintaining the economic growth and progress enjoyed
by the country.

"It is important for us to maintain our present economic growth rate in
order to ensure the continuation of current standards of living so that we
will be on par with developed countries," he said.

"The fund is aimed at producing more young entrepreneurs who are
innovative, dynamic and willing to face competition in order to acheive
success," he said.

At the function, Muhyiddin also presented loans amounting to R211,000 to
seven young entrepreneurs to allow them to conduct business in various
sectors. The loans ranged from RM16,000 to RM40,000.

Pakistan: Provinces to get equitable share under Youth Business Loan Scheme:PM

LENGTH: 616  words

DATELINE: MINGORA


INGORA, Jan. 16 -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday

said all provinces would get equitable share under the PM's Youth

Business Loan Scheme.

Addressing the loan seekers hailing from Malakand Division at Wadudia Hall here,
the Prime Minister said the loans would be dispensed in accordance with the
population ratio of each province.

The Prime Minister said the loan quota of a province would not diverted to any
other federating units in case less applications were received from a province.
Instead, the shortfall of the applications of that province would be shifted to
the next month, he added.

He said the applications for business loans would be decided

purely on merit regardless of affiliation with any political group.

He said neither Prime Minister nor a Minister could

recommend a person seeking loan under this scheme.

He said as a Prime Minister, he had the responsibility to give

utmost support and patronage to the youth.

Nawaz Sharif said the Scheme initiated by his government would prove a

launching pad for ushering in an era of economic prosperity and development in
the country.

Prime Minister Sharif urged the youth to get self-reliant by

prudently utilizing the business loans and contribute to the

national economy.

He asked the youth of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA) particularly to benefit from this scheme as they had faced huge
challenges in the recent past for their sacrifices for peace in their area.

He paid glowing tribute to valiant people of Malakand division for their
sacrifices for restoration of peace.

He assured that the youth business scheme would be implemented in letter and
spirit by removing the hurdles and said it would be further improved to make it
more simple and beneficial for the loan seekers.

He said various conditions of the loan scheme had been refined as now close
relatives could also furnish guarantee of the applicants. Similarly more than
one guarantor could also furnish guarantee of the loan seekers, he added.

He said this was the first time that banks were catering to

common people seeking loans. He mentioned that eighty per cent

people in China, America, United Kingdom, France and Germany

belonged to middle class who had a major contribution to the

economies of their countries.

Prime Minister Sharif said that development of Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) played key role in the economic development of any country but
unfortunately this sector had been ignored in Pakistan as no loan was extended
by any bank to the poor people in the past.

He recalled that in 1990s he had conceived this idea of developing SMEs but
could not do so due to certain problems. "But this time we launched this scheme
within six month after formation of the government," he added.

Nawaz Sharif interacted with several loan aspirants and

inquired about their plans for business.

To a woman loan seeker who requested to waive off the interest

on the loan, the Prime Minister said the amount was in lieu of the bank
services. He said otherwise, the market ratio on loans was 17-

18 percent which was much bigger as compared to that under this Scheme.

He said the government was also considering launching an interest-free loan
scheme at smaller level.

PM extols Dar for fitting the budget well!

LENGTH: 414  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


Praising Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday
said that the government's budget for fiscal year 2014-15 will provide relief to
the public.

"Dar has had sleepless nights while he was preparing the budget. I'm sure good
things will follow," the premier said while addressing the second balloting
ceremony of Prime Minister's Youth Business Loan Scheme (PMYBLS) in Islamabad.

Sharif said the government had little time to prepare its first budget last year
but still managed to meet some key targets for the outgoing fiscal year.

"The glass is 90 percent full and it is unfair to just point out the empty
space," the prime minister stressed.

Further, the prime minister said that the government was working day and night
and the results could be seen by the public.

"How can we have confidence in those who are unable to display results for their
[respective] provinces?" the prime minister asked while referring to criticism
by opposition parties.

The prime minister lauded the efforts of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and Maryam
Nawaz for making youth loan scheme a success.

Around 5,200 loan applications were selected successful in the second draw.

Nawaz Sharif distributed cheques among the successful applicants of the youth
loan. The initiative was designed to provide subsidized financing at 8 percent
mark-up per annum for 100,000 beneficiaries through the National Bank of
Pakistan and First Women Bank.

PM ENCOURAGES THE YOUTH:

Addressing the balloting ceremony, Prime Minister Sharif said that the
government started the loan scheme to provide the youth with opportunities to
make them financially stable.

"Big businesses easily get loans but deserving people with little resources are
not assisted adequately," he said, adding that there were numerous talented
people in the country who could change the fate of the nation.

The premier expressed confidence that the youth securing loans for businesses
would prove to be a harbinger of economic revolution in the country. Loan
programme would help alleviate poverty in the country, he said, adding that in
the first phase, 38,000 applications for loans had been received by the capital
under government's initiative for youth empowerment.

MORE MERCHANDISE FOR STUDENTS:

Sharif said that under fee reimbursement scheme, fees of students from
underprivileged areas would benefit deserving students and improve education in
country. He said his government will also distribute 100,000 laptops among the
students.

PM launches youth empowerment plan

BYLINE:  S Rahman

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 703

LENGTH: 890  words


Youth are the hope of the nation and the real masters of our destiny for whom
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif wants, from the core of his heart, to allocate
hundreds of billions for their uplift, education and skills' development.

This was the crux of Prime Minister's second address to the nation which,
according to the PM himself, was not a speech but an announcement of action
plans for the betterment of youth. The package initially equals an aggregate
figure of 20 billion rupees but this is not enough in comparison with his
commitment and passion to see the youth rise to the zenith, says the PM. And,
although the six schemes announced for the youth during his second address mean
a lot in terms of welfare and strengthening of our youth force, the PM wants to
go far ahead in these allocations and schemes but for the crunch the country is
facing.

On this occasion, the Prime Minister has told the nation in unequivocal terms
that the government is spending around 500 billion rupees a year for keeping
some institutions intact and operational. Obviously, that is a clear allusion to
power sector (with particular reference to power shortages) and to PIA, Steel
Mills and other such institutions. That indeed is a big burden that the
government is sharing in order to cope with national exigencies.

However, at no point during his address, the PM showed any signs of despair.
Rather, throughout his speech, he exuded confidence and faith in the country's
bright future for which he appears convinced that the youth would work as an
engine of change for the better.

The six schemes speak volumes of this faith in the youth and even a cursory look
into the schemes' overall plan suffices to tell us that practical, substantial
support to the talented youth is forthcoming especially those youth who remain
deprived of higher or professional education and training because of
insufficient (or even no) opportunities and because of financial constraints and
impoverishment.

The schemes have also been formulated in keeping with ground realities and in
line with day-to-day requirements of the youth. Nevertheless, the PM has invited
suggestions from the people and himself mentioned his mail address, cell phone
number and website on the TV screen, like the people's own leader who takes
pride in proximity with his countrymen. The PM wants to make the schemes more
transparent, merit-based and successful with public suggestions.

Details of these schemes would be available on the website www.pmo.gov.pk from
September 23 onwards and people can give their comments on the website.
Suggestions can also be sent in writing to the Prime Minister's office.

The schemes announced include easy business loans, laptops, education and
training on modern lines with an aim to enable the youth of the country to stand
on their feet besides contributing towards the country's economic growth.

And, as emphasized by the PM, the micro interest- free loan scheme is targeted
at disadvantaged sections of the society and would benefit two hundred and fifty
thousand people. An allocation of 3.5 billion rupees has been made during the
current financial year for this interest-free loan scheme.

Another scheme is Small Business Loan Scheme that has been designed for
unemployed, especially the educated youth to enable them to start their own
businesses.

Under the scheme loans ranging from five hundred thousand to two million rupees
would be advanced to youth at concessionary mark-up rate of eight percent and
the remaining burden of the mark-up would be borne by the government.

Fifty percent loans would be given to women and initially these loans would be
advanced by National Bank of Pakistan and First Women Bank. Five billion rupees
have been allocated for the scheme.

Under the Youth Training Scheme, those completing 16-year degree education from
recognized institutions would be given practical training to help them secure
jobs at home or abroad.

For this on-the-job training, Rs. 10,000 scholarship per month per graduate
would be given for one year and 50,000 graduates would benefit from the scheme.

Four billion rupees have been earmarked for this scheme. As regards the Youth
Skills Development Scheme, it is being launched for boys and girls who have
passed 8th class.

They will be given six months training in different trades along with
scholarship of 5,000 rupees a month. The government has earmarked eight hundred
million rupees for the scheme.

One of these schemes is highly encouraging for the people living in
under-developed areas and that is sponsoring of the tuition fee of students
belonging to backward areas so that brilliant students are not deprived of their
right to education due to financial constraints.

The government would pay at an average 40,000 rupees annual fee on behalf of
each of the 30,000 students for MA, M.Sc and higher level education. This scheme
is being launched at a cost of 1.2 billion rupees.

For the laptop scheme that is the demand of the youth and that has worked
wonders in Punjab, courtesy the pioneer work done by CM Mian Shahbaz Sharif in
this area, the Prime Minister has announced an allocation of four billion
rupees. The scheme would be known as Prime Minister's scheme for Provision of
Laptops.

Under the scheme one hundred thousand students would be provided laptops this
year by the federal government.

Youth Fund Entrepreneurs Lined Up for Training

BYLINE: Mugambi Mutegi And George Ngigi

LENGTH: 535  words


Borrowers from the Youth Enterprise Development Fund will be trained on basic
business management skills to help them run their businesses professionally.

Acting chief executive of the Fund, Mwatata Juma, says this will reduce rising
loan default rates.

Mr Juma put the current default rates at 40 per cent for youth groups advanced
loans at the constituency level, 20 per cent for individual borrowers and two
per cent for financial institutions that are used to lending.

"Most entrepreneurs lack the basic principles required in running and managing a
business. This has led to a high failure rate", he said. "All applicants to the
fund must now receive training prior to them receiving their money. This will
mitigate risk and empower the applicants".

The Youth Fund plans to set up 24 regional offices between January and March
next year, with each office serving two counties.

Two interns per constituency will be hired to mobilise, train, and assist in
collecting repayments.

Since its inception in 2006 and subsequent transformation into a State
corporation in 2007, the Youth Fund, whose main objective is to advance loans to
over 12 million Kenyans aged between 18- 35 has disbursed more than Sh2.9
billion.

The Fund has disbursed money to about 8,500 youth groups and 71,000 individual
enterprises. So far the Fund has covered 90 constituencies.

It has, however, also had a fair share of controversy with reports of massive
default rates surfacing earlier in the year.

Borrowers do not require collateral security to get access to the fund.

Political leaders and lobby groups called for tougher lending requirements to
avoid piling up bad debts.

The Fund is supposed to operate on revolving model, where the interest earned
and the loans are ploughed back into the kitty.

This, however, has only been achieved this financial year, a situation which Mr
Mwatata attributes to "failure of the loans taken up reaching threshold amounts
required to cater for administrative costs".

Interest earned from loans and the initial funds lent are meant to be ploughed
back into the kitty.

This, however, has only been achieved this year; four years after the fund's
inception.

Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, Paul Otuoma, said Sh1.8billion will be
given to the fund this year (up from Sh1billion last year).

"A critical amount is required to cater for administrative costs like running of
branch offices and allow revolving to take place", said Mr Mwatata.

Participants at a conference held late last month said poor communication, lack
of market linkages, lack of monitoring and lack of capacity building are major
factors contributing to the high default rates.

Ronald Osumba, a participant at the workshop, said the youth feel that there is
no obligation to repay the money.

This attitude coupled with lack of monitoring results in diversion of funds into
non-profit activities.

Kenya's public service employs 500,000 people of whom only 10 per cent retire in
a year while millions of youth join the unemployed ranks per annum.

Lack of sufficient strong property laws to protect innovations also exposes the
youth to exploitation.

Youths have lately been short-changed by big businesses due to lack of
protection by the law.

Streamline PM's Youth Programme

SECTION: Vol. 27 No. 263

LENGTH: 352  words


UNDER the umbrella of PM's Youth Programme, several programmes ranging from loan
scheme to skill development were launched by present government with much
fanfare. The aim was to help the youth that constitute majority of our
population, stand on their own feet but the programme has so far failed to make
any meaningful impact on the society because of certain limitations and
stringent measures.

Starting with the flagship youth business loan scheme, it was launched back in
December 2013 but despite the passage of more than two and a half years only
about 8200 clients have benefited from this scheme. In fact the PM himself has
expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of disbursements and denial in
credit to the applicants. Due to stringent measures, the interest of youth has
also faded which can explicitly be gauged by making a comparison between the
number of applicants in 2014 and now. Within six months of announcement of the
scheme, the NBP received over 60,000 applications but now about one to two
hundred people are applying quarterly. We, therefore, will suggest simplifying
the procedures of loan scheme and dropping preconditions such as that of
experience in order to motivate the youth to constructively join the scheme. It
will be more appropriate if this scheme is integrated with the skill development
programme. Anybody completing six month training in different demand driven
skills should be given preference to get loans under business loan scheme.
Government had also launched an interest free loan scheme but the loan given
under this head is so meagre and the procedure so hilarious that it frustrates
its own objectives. It will be better if the government either abandon this
scheme or enhance its allocations to reasonable level so that the people poor
could also start a respectable business. Much criticized is the laptop scheme,
which was meant for outstanding students of higher education is victim of
mismanagement and lacks transparency. There is a genuine need to review and
streamline the procedures and plug the loopholes to translate the declared
vision into reality.

Promoting entrepreneurship

BYLINE: Malik Muhammad Ashraf

SECTION: Vol. 31 No. 25

LENGTH: 1235  words


As part of the Entrepreneurship Speaker Series launched by the US embassy, a US
entrepreneur made a presentation at the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and
Industry on the 'Dos and don'ts of starting a business' and the unmistakable
conclusion was that the best way to nudge development and tackling unemployment
among the youth was to promote the culture of entrepreneurship among them. What
was suggested was surely a proven prescription for embarking on the path of
development.

An incisive appraisal of the developed countries reveals that their phenomenal
economic growth was propelled by entrepreneurship, which is rightly regarded as
a key to economic prosperity. Entrepreneurship is the capacity and willingness
to start a new business venture and the hallmark of entrepreneurial spirit is
innovation and risk taking. Countries like USA, Japan, Denmark, Germany, Taiwan
are quintessential of the role that entrepreneurship can play in the economic
development of a country and therefore are role models for other nations
aspiring to achieve self-sustained growth in the ever increasing competitive
global market.

To promote entrepreneurship it is important that the people with innovative
ideas and skills have access to the vital entrepreneurial resources like money,
talent and know-how to initiate new business, especially small and medium size
enterprises which are less volatile and more stable than the big and mega
industrial ventures due to their ability to provide bulk of the jobs in a
country. One of the major objectives of the governments and its economic
managers is to ensure full employment in the country or trying to ensure the
creations of maximum job opportunities for the ever growing labour force. But
the fact remains that the governments can only provide an enabling environment
to spur economic activity that leads to creation of more jobs in the private
sector.

In Pakistan also the government employs only 7-8% of the labour force. So like
all other nations the only option available to it is to propel economic activity
in the private sector through encouraging entrepreneurship in regards to the
establishment of small and medium size business and industry by making available
necessary resources and technical know-how to the youth entering the labour
market.

The PML-N government, recognising the importance of small and medium size
industries and business, creation of self-employment opportunities for the youth
in the economic development of the country and learning from past experience,
took a step in the right direction by launching Prime Minister's Youth Programme
in September 2013. The package comprised a Youth Business Loan Scheme, Youth
Skill Development Programme, Youth Training Programme, Programme, Provision of
laptops for talented students, Interest Free loan Scheme and Fee Re-imbursement
Scheme for less developed areas. These initiatives were designed to create a
culture of entrepreneurship by making available all the required ingredients to
the youth for starting their own business and enhancing their technical know-how
and skills for gainful employment in different sectors of the economy. The
defined objective of this package was: 'Enabling youth and poor segments of
population to get good opportunities of employment, economic empowerment,
acquiring skills needed for gainful employment, spreading use of computers and
imparting on the job training for young graduates to improve probability of
getting a productive job.'

The major flagship initiative of the package was the Youth Business Loan Scheme.
National Bank of Pakistan and Women Development Bank were entrusted with the
responsibility to disburse these loans amounting up to two million, ensuring
gender equality. Later most of the private banks including Sind Bank, MCB, Habib
Metropolitan Bank and Soneri Bank etc also joined the scheme. The step to
advance these loans through banks was taken in the light of the experience of
the past, to ensure transparency and eliminating prospects of political
interference. Another very important aspect of the scheme was that the Small and
Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) carried out pre-feasibility
studies as guidelines for prospective borrowers. These studies provided a
general understanding of the proposed business and were meant to promote
entrepreneurial culture in the country as they were structured like a business
plan.

An incisive look on all these programmes since their inception till date reveals
that they have been pursued with utmost commitment by the concerned agencies.
Under the Youth Business Loan Scheme loans amounting to Rs.2,512,693 million
have so far been disbursed among 17,861 individuals .To avoid delays in the
processing of loans, balloting has been replaced by the existing loan processing
procedures.

The HEC has reimbursed fees to 152798 the poor students up to March 2017 since
its inception in 2013 under the fee reimbursement scheme. The number of new
students registered for the scheme stands at 28592. An amount of Rs. 634,983,533
has been released to different universities for the year 2016-17.

Through the interest free loan scheme Rs.6110 millions have been given to
272,092 individuals. The number of laptops distributed among students is
188,188. Reportedly another consignment of 89,499 laptops has been delivered to
different universities for distribution among students. The Scheme is not being
executed in isolation. It is supplemented by other initiatives like Smart
University project wherein all universities have availability of WiFi throughout
the Campus; Smart Class project wherein students can attend and study virtually,
and have access to all the information being taught in the classroom; Smart
Assessment project, Education TV and HEC Cloud data center etc.

According to the official sources under the Youth Skill Development Programme,
24,934 students graduated in the first phase, 20,392 in the second phase and in
the third phase 23,880 have already completed their training courses while 25252
are still under training. The government has made available an amount of
Rs.4,608 million for the three phases. Similarly under the Youth Training Scheme
49,637 have been provided internship with different government departments and
entities. This scheme is for master degree and associate diploma holders who are
paid a stipend of Rs.12,000 during their one year internship.

As is evident all the foregoing initiatives launched by the government have been
pursued with uncompromising commitment and the progress on them so far has been
indeed very encouraging. The youth are the future of the country. Engaging them
in productive pursuits and self-employment avenues is the best insurance against
poverty and an indispensable guarantee for economic prosperity. The country can
move forward only when there are greater employment opportunities in the private
sector. Pakistani youth are around 35-40% of the total population and any move
that ensures and guarantees their gainful employment is bound to accelerate the
process of economic progress due to its multiplier effect besides enhancing tax
revenues of the government that this newly initiated economic activity will
generate.

The number of laptops distributed among students is 188,188. Reportedly another
consignment of 89,499 laptops has been delivered to different universities for
distribution among students.

Youth agency 'in full disarray' issues R212m in loans unlikely to be repaid

Parliamentary Editor

CAPE TOWN - The National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) has over the last two
years issued more than R200m worth of loans, which are unlikely to ever be
repaid, Auditor-General Terence Nombembe has reported to Parliament.

The agency, which is housed in the Presidency, has been rarely far from the
headlines, particularly over salaries and increases awarded to officials and
board members.

It is subject to a continuing investigation by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela
over the spending on the World Festival of Youth and Students in 2010 and
whether there was misappropriation of funds or fraud.

Scrutiny of the awarding of contracts by the agency and whether proper supply
chain management rules have been observed is also continuing.

Mr Nombembe - whose report is included in the National Youth Development
Agency's annual report tabled in Parliament yesterday - did not qualify his
audit, but highlighted significant problems with the agency's management.

He said in the 2012-13 financial year R30.5m of loans were impaired, which added
to the loans granted in 2011-12 of R192.8m, brought to R212m the amount of loans
impaired, & as the recoverability of these loans are doubtful& It is assumed
that some of these loans were repaid.

Earlier this year the agency's CEO was suspended and a new board put in place.
It has since undertaken a number of measures to strengthen the organisation. It
announced, among others, that it will no longer offer loans to young
entrepreneurs, but instead provide grant finance combined with business
development support. It would tap into a R1bn facility from the Industrial
Development Corporation and a R1.7bn facility from the Small Enterprise Finance
Agency, which were made available to boost young entrepreneurs.

In his report Mr Nombembe said material misstatements in the agency's financial
statements were found, but these were corrected, allowing the agency to avoid a
qualified audit report.

He found that the agency had not taken effective steps to prevent irregular and
wasteful expenditure and & effective and appropriate steps were not taken
against officials who incurred and/or permitted irregular, fruitless and
wasteful expenditure& The responsible minister in the Presidency, Collins
Chabane said he was delighted with the performance of the agency and & the
agency has demonstrated an acceptable record of governance and an improving
trajectory on performance& Democratic Alliance (DA) spokesman for the Presidency
Joe McGluwa said the youth agency's annual report revealed an organisation in
complete disarray.

Provinces to get equitable share under Youth Business Loan Scheme: PM

SECTION: Vol. 16 No. 15

LENGTH: 361  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Wednesday said all provinces would get equitable
share under the PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme.

Addressing the applicants of loan hailing from Swat, Malakand and Dir, the Prime
Minister said the loans would be dispensed in accordance with the population
ratio of each province.

The Prime Minister said if the received applicants from a province were less in
number, the other provinces would not fill the gap. Instead, he said, the loans
for that particular province would be transferred to next month.

He said the applications for business loans would be decided purely on merit
regardless of affiliation with any political group.

He said neither prime minister nor a minister could recommend a person seeking
loan under this scheme. He said as a prime minister, he had the responsibility
to give utmost support and patronage to the youth of this country.

Prime Minister Sharif urged the youth to get self-reliant by prudently utilizing
the business loans and contribute to the national economy.

He asked the youth of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
particularly to benefit from this scheme as they had faced huge challenges in
the recent past for their sacrifices for peace in their area.

He said this was the first time that banks were catering to common people
seeking loans. He mentioned that eighty per cent people in China, America,
United Kingdom, France and Germany belonged to middle class who had a major
contribution to the economies of their countries.

Nawaz Sharif interacted with several loan aspirants and inquired about their
plans for business. To a woman loan seeker who requested to waive off the
interest on the loan, the Prime Minister said the amount was in lieu of the bank
services. He said otherwise, the market ratio on loans was 17-18 per cent which
was much bigger as compared to that under this Scheme.

Governor KPK Engineer Shaukatullah, Minister for Information Senator Pervaiz
Rasheed, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yusuf, Advisor to PM
Amir Muqam, Deputy Speaker National Assembly Murtaza Javed Abbasi and Chairman
National Bank of Pakistan Muneer Kamal were present.

Omaheke Youths Receive Business Loans

LENGTH: 353 words

DATELINE: Gobabis


The Ministry of Youth, National Service, Sports and Culture on Friday granted
loans to 28 businesses owned by the youth in the Omaheke region. While some of
these businesses are entirely new establishments, a vast number has been in
existence for years. The Ministry disbursed N$66 000 to the businesses, which
were granted loans ranging between N$2 000 and N$ 20 000 on a revolving-credit
basis. These loans are repayable over a period of up to three years, depending
on the amount taken, while a grace period of one month is granted after
receiving the loan before repayments begin. The area of operations of the
businesses, which benefited from ranges from hair salon and car wash businesses
to take-aways, food stalls and shoe repairs' outfits.

Maria Ekongo from the Ministry's Youth Credit Guarantee Scheme urged the
beneficiaries to make use of the funds allocated to them for the intended
purposes, as such funds will be closely monitored. "You are the lucky ones from
almost 150 people who applied to be granted such loans. Therefore, you must
prove to be an example to others to follow behind you by utilising this money
for the purpose it is intended for, and keeping proper records of your spending
as you will have to account for it in the end," she stated. Ekongo said many
previous recipients of such loans have made a success of their businesses, and
this proves the importance of the scheme. She singled out Job Kakujaha, who owns
an upholstery business in Otjinene, and Julia Kavari, who runs a hair salon and
take-away in Aminuis as being amongst those who have made successes of the loans
granted to them. "We are always available to assist the youth where possible,
and everyone of us here can make a success of whatever we are working on if we
put in hard work and dedication to our initiatives", Ekongo noted. The Ministry
has to date disbursed N$ 601 500 in loans to youth projects in the Omaheke
region since the inception of the scheme in 2011. The loans are granted to
unemployed people between 18 and 35 years who have feasible business ideas which
can be transformed into operational businesses.

Provinces to get equitable share under Youth Business Loan Scheme:PM

SECTION: Vol. 16 No. 15

LENGTH: 583  words


Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday said all provinces would get equitable
share under the PM's Youth Business Loan Scheme.

Addressing the loan seekers hailing from Malakand Division at Wadudia Hall here,
the Prime Minister said the loans would be dispensed in accordance with the
population ratio of each province.

The Prime Minister said the loan quota of a province would not diverted to any
other federating units in case less applications were received from a province.
Instead, the shortfall of the applications of that province would be shifted to
the next month, he added.

He said the applications for business loans would be decided purely on merit
regardless of affiliation with any political group. He said neither Prime
Minister nor a Minister could recommend a person seeking loan under this
scheme.He said as a Prime Minister, he had the responsibility to give utmost
support and patronage to the youth. Nawaz Sharif said the Scheme initiated by
his government would prove alaunching pad for ushering in an era of economic
prosperity and development in the country.

Prime Minister Sharif urged the youth to get self-reliant by prudently utilizing
the business loans and contribute to the national economy.

He asked the youth of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA) particularly to benefit from this scheme as they had faced huge
challenges in the recent past for their sacrifices for peace in their area.

He paid glowing tribute to valiant people of Malakand division for their
sacrifices for restoration of peace.

He assured that the youth business scheme would be implemented in letter and
spirit by removing the hurdles and said it would be further improved to make it
more simple and beneficial for the loan seekers.

He said various conditions of the loan scheme had been refined as now close
relatives could also furnish guarantee of the applicants. Similarly more than
one guarantor could also furnish guarantee of the loan seekers, he added.

He said this was the first time that banks were catering to common people
seeking loans. He mentioned that eighty per cent people in China, America,
United Kingdom, France and Germany belonged to middle class who had a major
contribution to the economies of their countries.

Prime Minister Sharif said that development of Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) played key role in the economic development of any country but
unfortunately this sector had been ignored in Pakistan as no loan was extended
by any bank to the poor people in the past.

He recalled that in 1990s he had conceived this idea of developing SMEs but
could not do so due to certain problems. "But this time we launched this scheme
within six month after formation of the government," he added.

Nawaz Sharif interacted with several loan aspirants and inquired about their
plans for business. To a woman loan seeker who requested to waive off the
interest on the loan, the Prime Minister said the amount was in lieu of the bank
services. He said otherwise, the market ratio on loans was 17-18 percent which
was much bigger as compared to that under this Scheme. He said the government
was also considering launching an interest-free loan scheme at smaller level.

Youth to receive loans from September

BYLINE: NATION REPORTER -1

LENGTH: 219  words


The government will begin giving out loans without interest to the youth and
women in September, Deputy President William Ruto said on Sunday.

Mr Ruto said the money would be made available to all youth, urging them to be
ready to apply for the money.

"We are urging all the youths and women to get ready for the loans. We will not
cap any interest on them so they should not fear to apply for the money," he
said at the St James ACK Church Buruburu, Nairobi, on Sunday.

The government had promised to remove the interest charged on the loans given
the youths when it took office in April.

On Sunday, Mr Ruto urged the target groups to ensure they came up with viable
ideas to make it easier for them to access the Sh6 billion loans.

Initially, the loans given under the Youth Enterprise Development fund attracted
interest of less than 10 per cent.

The announcement comes at a time the Senate is pushing for the creation of
another fund to help unemployed fresh  university graduates.

At the same time, Mr Ruto said the government had agreed with Nairobi Governor
Evans Kidero to begin constructing 100,000 modern houses to replace the ageing
ones in a number of estates in Eastlands.

As per the agreement, the houses should be completed in three years.

Estates targeted include Ziwani, Makadara, Jericho, Bahati and Mbotela.

The Role of Entrepreneurship in Development

LENGTH: 1095  words


Innovation is the way forwardAn incisive appraisal of the developed countries
reveals that their phenomenal economic growth was propelled by entrepreneurship,
which is rightly regarded as a key to economic prosperity. Entrepreneurship is
the capacity and willingness to start a new business venture and the hallmark of
entrepreneurial spirit is innovation and risk taking.

Countries like USA, Japan, Denmark, Germany, Taiwan are quintessential of the
role that entrepreneurship can play in the economic development of a country
and, therefore, are role models for other nations aspiring to achieve
self-sustained growth in the ever increasing competitive global market.To
promote entrepreneurship it is important that the people with innovative ideas
and skills have access to the vital entrepreneurial resources like money, talent
and know-how to initiate new business, especially small and medium size
enterprises.

One of the major objectives of the governments and its economic managers is to
ensure full employment in the country or trying to ensure the creation of
maximum job opportunities for the ever growing labour force. But the fact
remains that the governments can only provide an enabling environment to spur
economic activity that leads to creation of more jobs in the private sectorIn
Pakistan the government employs only 7-8% of the labour force.

So like all other nations the only option available to it is to nudge economic
activity in the private sector through encouraging entrepreneurship in regards
to the establishment of small and medium size business and industry by making
available necessary resources and technical know-how to the youth entering the
labour market.In the past, several initiatives were taken in the public sector
to nudge small and medium size business in the form of loans to the youth but
unfortunately they all failed to create the desired impact due to the rampant
corruption in the public organisations.

The parties in power actually showed favours on their own political workers and
in most of the cases loans were advanced on fake documents without proper
collateral and on the basis of political influence.The result was that billions
of rupees were lost to this plunder and despite best efforts of the state bank
the money could not be recovered.

The other reason for failure of those efforts was that the basic ingredients of
entrepreneurship like the technical know-how and talent to start a business were
totally neglected while advancing loans. There was no support available in the
public sector for carrying out research and preparing feasibility reports in
regards to different lines of business and industry.

The result was that the institutions like Youth Investment Programmes (YIPS) and
Small Business Finance Corporation, the two main financial institutions in the
public sector for promoting small and medium industries and businesses, had to
be closed.But it is encouraging to note that recognising the importance of small
and medium size industries and business, creation of self-employment
opportunities for the youth in the economic development of the country and
learning from the past bitter experience, the PML  N government took a step in
the right direction by launching Prime Minister's Youth Programme in September
2013 a package comprising Youth Business Loan Scheme, Youth Skill Development
Programme, Youth Training Programme, Programme for provision of laptops,
Interest Free loan Scheme and Fee Re-imbursement Scheme for Less Developed
Areas.

These initiatives were designed to create a culture of entrepreneurship by
making available all the required ingredients to the youth for starting their
own business and enhancing their technical know-how and skills for gainful
employment in different sectors of the economy. The defined objective of this
package was enabling youth and poor segments of population to get good
opportunities of employment, economic empowerment, acquiring skills needed for
gainful employment, spreading use of computers and imparting on the job training
for young graduates to improve probability of getting a productive job.

The major and the flag ship initiative of the package was the Youth Business
Loan Scheme. National Bank of Pakistan and Women Development Bank were entrusted
with the responsibility to disburse these loans amounting up to two million at a
nominal interest rate of 8%, ensuring gender equality in advancing these loans.

The step to advance these loans through banks was taken in the light of the
unenviable experience of the past, to ensure transparency and eliminating
prospects of political interference. Another very important aspect of the scheme
was that the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) carried
out pre-feasibility studies as guidelines for prospective borrowers.

These studies provided a general understanding of the proposed business and were
meant to promote entrepreneurial culture in the country as they were structured
like a business plan.A recent review of this scheme and other initiatives
reveals that so far Rs 11.

03 billion has been sanctioned for 15,101 individuals. In view of its
importance, transparency and its unblemished track record so far, 14 other banks
including Sindh Bank, HBL, MCB, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Meezan Bank and UBL
have also joined the scheme.

National Bank is also contemplating to develop pre-feasibilities for almost 100
trades in addition to restructuring of the scheme. From now on balloting will be
replaced by the existing loan processing procedures.

These measures will ensure quick disposal of the loan applications and
identification of the trades where the applicants can invest profitably.Under
the supporting initiative of Skill Development Programme, 22,000 students were
imparted training in different skills in the first phase.

In the second phase of the programme 21,934 students underwent training.
Recruitment for the third phase is already underway.

Students are being given training in 195 demand-driven trades through 130
training centres. Under the Laptop Scheme the HEC has distributed 93,255 laptops
among PhD, MPhil and MS students.

Similarly 84,078 students from 78 universities have been paid back their fees by
HEC. However from now onward the HEC will make up front payments to the eligible
students at the time of admission.

Under the interest free loan scheme Rs 19 billion have been given to 90,750
applicants. These are encouraging results and there is a need to pursue these
initiatives more vigorously to achieve the desired results.

PM assures transparency in Youth Loan Scheme

LENGTH: 495  words

DATELINE: HYDERABAD


HYDERABAD, Jan. 4 -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday assured the
disbursements under Youth Business Loan Scheme would be made transparently and
the violators of merit would be dealt with strictly.

"Neither me nor any authority in the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) can favour
anyone to get loan under this scheme. I even do not have such powers," Prime
Minister said addressing the launching ceremony of the scheme here.

Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage Senator
Pervaiz Rashid and Sindh Chief Minister Qaim Ali Shah and other senior
government officials were also present on the occasion.

Describing it as social cancer, the Prime Minister expressed the government's
resolve to curb favouritism, vowing to enforce the merit policy at all costs.

He said he had envisioned the loan scheme during his previous tenure but it
could not materialise as the government could not complete its term.

He said the loan scheme would help boost the country's GDP (gross domestic
product) and support the families of borrowers as well as of those allied with
their businesses.

He recalled that the recovery rate of Yellow Cab Scheme was almost 99 percent
and hoped the youngsters would also pay back this loan honestly.

He said the conditions for guarantors in the Loan Scheme had been eased keeping
in view the difficulties faced by the youth.

Now anyone, including the blood relatives having net worth of 1.5 times of the
loan amount could give the guarantee. Moreover, any government officer of
Grade-15 with eight or more years of remaining service could be a guarantor, he
added.

He said even more than one person with cumulative net worth of more than 1.5
times of the loan amount could give collective guarantees for a single
applicant. Even, the applicant having required net worth could give his own
guarantee.

The applicant could have his bank account in any bank, including NBP, the Prime
Minister said. He said, "We have to trust the youth and give them financial
independence to play a positive role in the national economy." The prime
minister said in the past, loans were given only to influential ones and
entities, while the small borrowers were neglected.

"We have decided to give loans to small borrowers in order to give benefit to
the skilled youth and lower strata of the society. This is a programme launched
for the youth, who are the builders of Pakistan," he said.

Prime Minister met the applicants and inquired about their plans after getting
the loan.

Speaking about infrastructure projects in Sindh, the prime minister said the
government had a comprehensive plan to build road network in Hyderabad and
Karachi. The Japanese government had shown interest in Karachi Circular Railway
Project, which would be initiated soon, he added.
