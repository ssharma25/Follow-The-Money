Washington: USDA Seeks Applications for Health Care Grants in the Delta Region

LENGTH: 664  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



 Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) is seeking applications for grants to improve health care in
the Delta Region. Nearly $4.4 million in grant funding is available through the
Delta Health Care Services Grant Program.





 "The Delta Health Care Services Grant Program and other programs like it are
helping rural America to rebound," said Vilsack. "USDA's targeted grant programs
and development projects can help Delta towns access high-quality medical and
health care services, improving the quality of life for residents and enriching
the area's ability to support strong communities for generations to come."



 Groups eligible for grants include higher education institutions, health and
research institutes, economic development entities, health care cooperatives or
consortia of these entities. Recipients must serve residents of the Delta
Region, which includes 252 counties and parishes in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.



 USDA is encouraging applications for projects in census tracts with poverty
rates greater than or equal to 20 percent. Grants are awarded on a competitive
basis. The maximum award per grant is $1 million. USDA has provided more than
$17 million for 31 projects funded through the Delta Health Care Services Grant
Program since the start of the Obama Administration.



 Paper applications are due Nov. 14. Electronic copies are due Nov. 7. For more
information, see page 62854 of the Sept. 13, 2016, Federal Register. Please
contact your local Rural Development State Office to request the application
guide and materials.



 Sam Rikkers, administrator for USDA's Rural Business-Cooperative Service,
underscored the importance of the Delta Health Care Services Grant Program
during a Sept. 8 visit to Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond. While
there, Rikkers awarded the school a $646,482 grant to enhance a health care
training project the University launched in 2013, also with USDA funding through
the Delta Health program.



 The University is expanding a program in which volunteers are trained as health
coaches and motivational aides as part of a care coordination strategy. The
program is designed to reduce hospital readmissions, improve patient health and
enhance the quality of the medical workforce. The University also will expand
its health coach internship program to include students from more health care
disciplines.



 Today's funding builds on USDA's historic investments in rural America over the
past seven years. Since 2009, USDA has worked to strengthen and support rural
communities and American agriculture, an industry that supports one in 11
American jobs, provides American consumers with more than 80 percent of the food
we consume, ensures that Americans spend less of their paychecks at the grocery
store than most people in other countries, and supports markets for homegrown
renewable energy and materials.



 Since 2009, USDA Rural Development (@USDARDThis is an external link or
third-party site outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website. ) has invested $13.5 billion for 5,739 water and waste infrastructure
projects, benefiting 19.1 million rural residents; invested nearly $13 billion
to start or expand nearly 112,000 rural businesses; helped 1.1 million rural
residents buy homes; funded nearly 9,200 community facilities such as schools,
public safety and health care facilities; and helped bring high-speed Internet
access to nearly 6 million rural residents and businesses. USDA also has
invested $31.3 billion in 963 electric projects that have financed more than
185,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines serving 4.6 million rural
residents.

Delta Health Alliance Receives $600,000 Grant To Reduce Hospital Readmissions

   Jul 13, 2016

   Delta Health Alliance announced that it had received a $600,000 three-year
grant from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to work with Delta
hospitals to reduce costly readmissions.Delta Health Alliance is partnering with
South Sunflower County Hospital and North Sunflower Medical Center, Sunflower
Clinic, Indianola Family Medical Group, and Leland Clinic for the
project.According to Karen Matthews, Delta Health Alliance CEO, &ldquoWhat we
have learned is that by investing a modest amount of money in paying for a
health coach at a local hospital, we can save five to ten times that investment
by helping a patient apply complex medication protocols or understand necessary
follow up treatment after a hospital discharge.&rdquo The grant will provide
individualized attention for patients going from in-patient hospital care to
out-patient clinic care. The goal of the grant is to lower health care costs
while ensuring that patients receive more timely and personal care without
having to re-enter a hospital. &ldquoDelta residents struggling with chronic
disease now have a real person to help them transition from the hospital back
home,&rdquosaid Matthews, &ldquospecially trained patient navigators are working
with patients to ensure they receive appropriate education and access to support
services for family caregivers, which is the key to preventing hospital
readmission in the 30 days after hospital discharge.&rdquo

Extension Office, Life Health Mental Health Center, Health Help Mississippi,
Mississippi Oral Health Association, and Mississippi Tobacco Free Coalition. The
project, known as Mississippi Delta Healthy Start Collaborative, will expand
services of DHA's successful Delta Parents as Teachers program in Leflore County
then carry the program into neighboring Holmes and Humphreys counties. Enrolled
families (pregnant women through parents with children up to age five) will
receive pregnancy and parent education, case management, safety instruction,
life planning, navigational assistance accessing maternal and infant services
and insurance coverage, early childhood development programs, childhood literacy
initiatives, and access to a newly added fatherhood program, Delta Dads. "While
there has been some improvement statewide in infant mortality, lower rates have
been slow to materialize in our poorest, most isolated communities," states
Karen Matthews, Delta Health Alliance CEO. "Our targeted service area of
Leflore, Holmes and Humphries counties is representative of these needs. The
program has the potential to be replicated into other communities in the Delta."

Aug. 27--NAPERVILLE, Ill. -- Nonprofit and public organizations can apply for
grants to fund programs and services that improve the oral health of Illinois
children.

Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation, the 501 (c)(3) philanthropic arm of Delta
Dental of Illinois, will accept applications for its annual Community Grants
Program until Sept. 9.

The foundation focuses its funding on programs and/or organizations targeting
children's access to oral health care and overall oral health education and
awareness. Grants range from $1,000 to $10,000. This year, a total of $150,000
in grants will be awarded.

As part of Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation's commitment to improve
children's oral health in Illinois, the foundation awarded nearly $150,000 to 16
organizations last year through the Community Grants Program. Some examples are:
the Asian Human Services Family Health Center Inc. in Chicago, which used the
grant money to add a fourth operatory room to its dental clinic; the Douglas
County Health Department in Tuscola, which used the grant money to provide oral
health awareness and education to Amish populations in three counties; and the
Illinois State Dental Society Foundation in Springfield, which used the grant
money to help support Mission of Mercy, a two-day dental clinic that provides
free dental care to Illinois residents.

"Too many children in Illinois suffer from preventable dental disease and face
significant barriers to access the oral health care they need," said Delta
Dental of Illinois Foundation's Lora Vitek, director of philanthropy and
community relations. "Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation developed its
Community Grants Program in 2013 to help organizations focused on improving
children's oral health in Illinois build upon their programs. We are honored to
have partnered with more than 40 organizations across Illinois to improve oral
health and advance oral health education in the state. The need is great and we
look forward to working with more organizations and programs that share our
mission and work tirelessly to improve children's oral health in Illinois."

Grant applicants must have a physical presence in the state of Illinois; be a
public charity classified as exempt from federal income taxes under section 501
(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or, be a public or governmental entity such
as a public school or health department. The application and complete list of
criteria are available at www.ddilfoundation.org/grantreq.aspx.

The Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation was formed in March 2008 by Delta Dental
of Illinois, a nonprofit dental service corporation with a mission to improve
the oral health of the communities it serves. Delta Dental of Illinois
Foundation is the 501(c)(3) charitable arm of Delta Dental of Illinois and works
to support and improve the oral health of people in Illinois. In the past
decade, combined efforts of Delta Dental of Illinois and Delta Dental of
Illinois Foundation have provided more than $3 million to programs and
organizations in Illinois that improve the oral health of the residents of
Illinois.

Information Collection Request Title: Data Collection Tool for Rural Health
Community-Based Grant Programs.

OMB No.: 0915-0319--Extension.

Abstract: There are currently five rural health grant programs that operate
under the authority of Section 330A of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act.
These programs include: (1) Rural Health Care Services Outreach Grant Program
(Outreach); (2) Rural Health Network Development Grant Program (Network
Development); (3) Small Healthcare Provider Quality Grant Program (Quality); (4)
Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program (Delta) and (5) Rural
Health Network Development Planning Grant Program (Network Planning). These
grants are to provide expanded delivery of health care services in rural areas,
for the planning and implementation of integrated health care networks in rural
areas, and for the planning and implementation of quality improvement and
workforce activities. In general, the grants may be used to expand access,
coordinate, and improve the quality of essential health care services and
enhance the delivery of health care in rural areas.

Need and Proposed Use of the Information: For these programs, performance
measures were drafted to provide data useful to the programs and to enable HRSA
to provide aggregate program data required by Congress under the Government
Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993. These measures cover the principal
topic areas of interest to ORHP, including: (a) Access to care; (b) the
underinsured and uninsured; (c) workforce recruitment and retention; (d)
sustainability; (e) health information technology; (f) network development; and
(g) health related clinical measures. Several measures will be used for all six
programs. All measures will speak to the ORHP's progress toward meeting the
goals set.

Summary of Prior Comments and Agency Response: A 60-day Federal Register Notice
was published in the Federal Register on March 10, 2014 (see 79 FR13311-12). One
comment was received requesting a copy of the data collection plans and draft
instruments that are referenced in the 60-day Federal Register notice for Rural
Health Care Services Outreach Grant Program (Outreach); Rural Health Network
Development Grant Program (Network Development); Small Healthcare Provider
Quality Grant Program (Quality); and Rural Health Network Development Planning
Grant Program (Network Planning). HRSA provided the draft instruments on March
12, 2014, via email.

Likely Respondents: Award recipients of the programs under the Section 330A of
the Public Health Service Act.

Burden Statement: Burden in this context means the time expended by persons to
generate, maintain, retain, disclose or provide the information requested. This
includes the time needed to review instructions; to develop, acquire, install

River Delta unites over health care

BYLINE: Dan Nguyen, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 71 words


Jul. 30--The wide geographic expanse of the River Delta Unified School District
has made it easy to see the district, divided by differing economics and county
boundaries, in terms of north and south.

The 2004 school bond measure, for example, was voted on by both regions
separately.

And the recent district recon-figuration, which targets the schools in the
north, renewed long-held tensions between the two ends of the district.

Even health care has been divided, with Healthy Start serving children in the
north and Rio Vista Caring Actions Reach Out to Everyone serving those to the
south.

District and school officials hope that a new push to coordinate both agencies'
efforts will improve health care districtwide.

Robert Hubbell, the district's new chief educational services officer, helped to
facilitate a relationship between the two agencies. Initially, he said he heard
skepticism that the agencies would cross the line between north and south --
determined by attendance boundaries for the north and south high schools.

But, he was determined that the entire district benefit from the respective
strengths of each agency, despite the traditional tendency for services to be
kept within their own regions.

"People are starting to understand if you're talking to me, you're talking about
up and down river," Hubbell said.

Healthy Start and Rio Vista CARE have been enthusiastic about working together.
They met this past week to flesh out ways to expand their services districtwide.

Earlier this month, the school board approved $30,000 to be split between both
agencies.

"The potential is great there, to enhance our program and increase the quality
of delivery," said Holly Pauls, the district's Healthy Start coordinator and a
registered nurse for the north schools.

The district's north end is served by Healthy Start, a state-funded program.
River Delta Unified won a $400,000 grant in 2001 for the program. This grant
money has run out, but the program also is funded by money from the north
schools and grants that Pauls and her staff members apply for.

Among the services Healthy Start provides is arranging for AmeriCorps volunteers
to tutor in the north schools. Healthy Start also does outreach to low-income
and Spanish-speaking families, encouraging them to enroll their children in
health insurance.

Rio Vista CARE is a nonprofit grass-roots program founded 21 years ago that
focuses on counseling, though it also provides similar services to Healthy Start
for students in the south. Its funding comes from private and county grants, and
donations from the Isleton and Rio Vista communities.

Last year, Rio Vista CARE's staff of licensed and intern counselors worked with
112 students in the south schools and held more than 1,500 counseling sessions.

What will a collaboration between the two agencies look like? It's too early to
tell, said Araminta Blackwelder, CARE's executive director and founder. Neither
agency has the resources to completely meet all the needs in its service area.

One option would be for the north schools to refer students to Rio Vista CARE
for counseling. Also, Healthy Start could use its connections with AmeriCorps to
arrange for volunteers at the southern schools.

"We're taking baby steps to figure out how the students in the district can be
served adequately," Blackwelder said."

Nonprofit and public organizations may begin applying for grants to fund
programs and services that improve the oral health of Illinois children.

Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation, the 501(c)(3) philanthropic arm of Delta
Dental of Illinois, will accept applications for its annual Community Grants
Program from Aug. 1 until Sept. 9.

The foundation focuses its funding on programs and/or organizations targeting
children's access to oral health care and overall oral health education and
awareness. Grants range from $1,000 to $10,000. This year, a total of $150,000
in grants will be awarded.

As part of Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation's commitment to improve
children's oral health in Illinois, the foundation awarded nearly $150,000 to 16
organizations in 2015 through the Community Grants Program.

Some examples are: the Asian Human Services Family Health Center Inc. in
Chicago, which used the grant money to add a fourth operatory room to its dental
clinic; the Douglas County Health Department in Tuscola, which used the grant
money to provide oral health awareness and education to Amish populations in
three counties; and the Illinois State Dental Society Foundation in Springfield,
which used the grant money to help support Mission of Mercy, a two-day dental
clinic that provides free dental care to Illinois residents.

"Too many children in Illinois suffer from preventable dental disease and face
significant barriers to access the oral health care they need," said Lora Vitek,
director of philanthropy and community relations for Delta Dental of Illinois
Foundation.

"Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation developed its Community Grants Program in
2013 to help organizations focused on improving children's oral health in
Illinois build upon their programs. We are honored to have partnered with more
than 40 organizations across Illinois to improve oral health and advance oral
health education in the state.

"The need is great and we look forward to working with more organizations and
programs that share our mission and work tirelessly to improve children's oral
health in Illinois," she said.

Grant applicants must have a physical presence in the state of Illinois; be a
public charity classified as exempt from federal income taxes under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or be a public or governmental entity
such as a public school or health department.

The application and complete list of criteria are available at

Chevron star calls Social Circle home

Social Circle was the site of the unveiling of a new national gasoline
advertising vehicle.

Chevron debuted its latest car character to be used to promote Chevron Techron
gasoline.

The car character, dubbed Casey Coupe, is No.  18 in the petroleum company's
line.

"We are very pleased to be recognized by Chevron Products Co. as the hometown of
newest Chevron Car character," said Social Circle Mayor Jim Burgess.  "Being
selected as the hometown of Casey Coupe is a high honor and distinction for our
community and the Better Hometown Program."

The car character ad campaign, originated by Young and Rubicam agency in San
Francisco, has won Cleo advertising awards.

Casey Coupe will be included in a new Disneyland theme park attraction, "
Autopia."

ALPHA DELTA KAPPA HONORED: State School Superintendent Linda Schrenko issued a
letter of recognition praising the Rockdale chapter of the Alpha Delta Kappa, an
international honorary society for women teachers and administrators.

The club, which has 30 members, has donated money for books for the Boys & Girls
Club and the Lakeview Program. The club also has contributed small treats for
the Meals on Wheels program. It awards $ 300 in scholarships to two Rockdale
County students each year.

SANDS TO RETIRE: Bill Sands, Rockdale County's executive assistant to the board
of commissioners, will retire at the end of the year.

Sands has been acting as finance director following the retirement of Deb Dobbs
in July. Under his watch, Moody's Investors Service recently upgraded the
county's credit rating to A1, which means the county can borrow money at a lower
interest rate.

His position will be changed to director of legal affairs, which will prioritize
and channel staff requests for legal advice to county attorneys.

HOSPITAL ACCREDITED: Rockdale Hospital and Health System and Rockdale Home
Health Services have been accredited by a nationally recognized health care
standards organization.

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations sent a team of
surveyors in September to evaluate employees and procedures against a national
set of standards. The joint commission, formed in 1951, is dedicated to
improving the quality of health care through voluntary accreditation.

"Above all, national standards are intended to stimulate continuous, systematic
and organization-wide improvement in performance and outcomes of care," said Dr.
Russell P. Massaro, executive vice president of Division of Accreditation
Operations.

"The community should be proud the Rockdale Hospital and its Home Health
services are focusing on the most challenging goal --- to continuously raise
quality to higher levels."

If the hospital had not received accreditation, it could have been closed down.

The accreditation lasts for three years.

ATLANTA BOYS CHOIR TO PERFORM: The Atlanta Boy Choir will perform Saturday at
the Monastery of the Holy Spirit.

Sponsored by the Conyers-Rockdale Council for the Arts. This is the 12th year
the choir has performed at the monastery. The concert is the only public event
in the Abbey of Our Lady of Holy Spirit.

Proceeds will be used to pay for the monastery's programs to feed the hungry and
to benefit the Arts Council.

The concert will honor the late Bernard Joseph "Bernie" Bourdon, a community
activist and chaplain at Shepherd's Gate Hospice who established a local Meals
on Wheels program. Bourdon also was a mentor at Edwards Middle School and in the
Rockdale Reads Literacy Program.

The program begins at 7 p.m. Tickets cost $ 17.50 and are available at the
Conyers Welcome Center or at the Arts Council by calling 770-922-3143.

The monastery is located at 2625 Ga. 212 in Conyers.

TURKEY TOT TROT: The Elks Aidmore Children's Center is sponsoring a 5-
kilometer, one-mile run and Turkey Tot Trot on Saturday.

The 5K race begins at the center at 2394 Morrison Road, Conyers, at 9 a.m. The
one-mile run starts at 10 a.m. Registration is at 8 a.m.

Prizes will be awarded to the top finisher, male and female, and to the first
three in each group by age and gender.

Afterward, the center is offering a fall festival, hayrides, apple cider and
visits to the Elks Honey Creek Campground.

The Aidmore Children's Center provides shelter to girls age 12 to 18 who have
been in trouble with the law or who have been abused or neglected.

Substance abuse groups join forces

BYLINE: Maria Saporta, Staff

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Business; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 835 words

Two organizations trying to prevent substance abuse in Georgia have merged with
the encouragement of the business community.

The merger combined the Georgia Association for the Prevention and Treatment of
Substance Abuse, founded in 1992 as a coalition of providers and other
interested organizations, with Mission New Hope, founded in 1994 by the Atlanta
business community.

The new organization is called the Georgia Council on Substance Abuse. It will
be stronger than its two parts, said Frank Skinner, a retired BellSouth
executive who founded Mission New Hope.

"I would like to think we took the best of both organizations," Skinner said.
"There was a wonderful chemistry immediately."

The board includes several business leaders who served on Mission New Hope's
board. Tom Roeck, a former Delta Air Lines executive and now chairman of health
care firm Chamberlin Edmonds, is chairman.

Other board members are: Hines Brannan, Atlanta managing partner for Arthur
Andersen; Warren Jobe, a senior vice president of Southern Co.; Kent C. "Oz"
Nelson, retired chief executive of the United Parcel Service; Betty Siegel,
president of Kennesaw State University; and W. Thomas Smith, a retired IBM
executive who is now chairman of Total Technology Ventures.

One of Mission New Hope's biggest accomplishments was helping establish the
Fulton County Drug Court. Today several other such drug courts, in which non-
violent offenders with substance abuse problems can get treatment rather than go
to jail, have popped up around the state.

The Georgia Association worked as a policy and advocacy organization and
successfully raised awareness in the General Assembly of substance abuse
problems. Its executive director, Becky Vaughan, is president of the merged
group.

The timing was good because Mission New Hope lost its executive director a
little more than a year ago. United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta has agreed to be
a major financial backer of the new council.

Delta aids literacy

Delta Air Lines believes the community should increase its support to Literacy
Action, an Atlanta-based organization that helps teach people to read and write.

Delta made a $ 75,000 challenge grant to be matched by new and expanded gifts
from other donors.

"We were looking at the amount of revenue they were bringing in each year, and
they weren't ample or sufficient," said Mike Young, Delta's vice president of
community affairs. "This is a great organization that needs more resources."

Last year, Literacy Action's annual campaign brought in $ 747,000, which will be
significantly increased with the Delta challenge grant. Literacy Action has
1,000 to 1,200 students a year. Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young likes to point
out that literacy was a cornerstone of the civil rights movement. People had to
learn to read and write before they could vote.

One example is Johnathan Horner, 44, a Literacy Action student from 1990 to
1993. By becoming literate, Horner was able to go from a job in the fast food
industry to one at the V.A. Medical Center. He is on Literacy Action's board and
is one of its top ambassadors.

When he goes to schools, Homer tells students he graduated from high school
without knowing how to read and write by cheating. "Now I realize that an
education is more important than cheating," Horner said.

Dow Chemical Co. this week donated $ 5 million of Styrofoam insulation to
Americus-based Habitat for Humanity International. Also, hundreds of Dow
employees and customers worked at the Jimmy Carter Work Project in Plains for

The Dow gift helps Habitat in its goal to raise $ 500 million to provide
affordable housing for people around the world.

Former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn will be the keynote speaker at the third annual prayer
breakfast on Nov. 6. The breakfast, sponsored by the Atlanta Rotary Club, has
drawn 1,400 attendees the last two years.

Economic forecaster Donald Ratajczak has joined the international advisory board
of Globaletutor.com, an Atlanta-based online entertainment and education company
for K-12 students.

Arden Group, an Atlanta investment management firm, has made a $ 25,000
contribution to the Episcopal Media Center, based in Atlanta. The center,
formerly known as the Episcopal Radio-TV Foundation, has been based in Atlanta
for the past 55 years. Arden Group's grant will help fund an educational series
called "Living With Money."

Big Brothers Big Sisters of Metro Atlanta had a big week. On Saturday, poet Maya
Angelou was the honorary chair at its annual gala that recognized baseball
legend Hank Aaron and his wife, Billye Aaron; and Cox Enterprises CEO Jim
Kennedy, and his wife, Sarah Kennedy. Then on Tuesday, Big Brothers Big Sisters

Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia, Andersen Consulting and Southern Co. and its
subsidiary, Georgia Power.

Volunteers in Medicine receives grant

BYLINE: Herald-Times, Bloomington, Ind.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 267 words


Feb. 16--A grant to Volunteers in Medicine will help the organization continue
providing basic dental services to less fortunate members of the community.

The $2,000 grant from the Delta Dental Foundation will help the community-owned,
operated and financed medical clinic purchase equipment for its dental services,
according to a news release.

"Lack of dental coverage is arguably one of the biggest gaps in health care
access in this community, and VIM is the only source of free dental care in our
region," VIM executive director Nancy Richman said in the release.

Richman said that along with a full range of essential dental services provided
at no cost to adults in Monroe and Owen counties, VIM also provides the
education and preventive care necessary to sustain oral health long-term.

The Delta Dental Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Delta Dental, the nation's
largest dental plan system, has provided grants totaling nearly $20 million
since its inception in 1980 to programs nationwide.

Foundation director Teri Battaglieri said the foundation was proud to recognize
VIM's work in the community by awarding the grant.

"By increasing access to dental care, we can help improve the oral and overall
health and well-being of children and adults by preventing serious health issues
down the road," Battaglieri said in the release.

U of S student receives scholarship; Rylan Grant, 23, keynote speaker at MyFiH
luncheon

BYLINE: Dustin Munroe, The StarPhoenix

Rylan Grant wants to make Saskatchewan care homes safer for patients and easier
for nurses to manage.

Grant, 23, has worked with fellow University of Saskatchewan engineering student
Herbert Mueller in creating CareMate, a wireless indoor system that gives nurses
the ability to track patients in real time.

"You can think of it as a GPS indoors," said Grant.

"The residents have a little device that they carry with them, with a button on
it that they can push when they need help."

Grant was the keynote speaker at the My Future is Here (MyFiH) luncheon
sponsored by the Saskatchewan Rotary Youth Foundation on Thursday at the Delta
Bessborough Hotel.

The luncheon started with the announcement of $54,075 in scholarships and
business capital funding awards for young Saskatchewan entrepreneurs.

Grant was the only dual recipient among the 18 people honoured. He received a
$5,000 scholarship, as well as a $6,575 in capital funds for Delta Point
Wireless, the company behind CareMate.

With CareMate, nurses can track the location of all the residents of a
health-care facility from either a central computer or a portable handheld
device.

The system has the potential to save precious seconds in an emergency, but can
also be used for everyday activities such as helping gather residents for meals
or medication.

Grant and Mueller developed the system for their fourth-year engineering project
last year. Grant is working toward a double degree in electrical engineering and
computer science.

Combined with the entrepreneur certificate he is striving for through the
College of Engineering and Edward School of Business, he has all the right tools
to turn a classroom project into a viable business venture.

Groups that run capital fund competitions seem to agree. Grant and Mueller have
won three business capital fund competitions this year.

Delta Point Wireless has amassed $41,000 in cash and $10,000 in in-kind services
from competitions held by Saskatoon-based Venture Forward, the Regina Regional
Economic Authority's Progress 2 Capital and My Future is Here (MyFiH).

Grant spoke of his introduction to entrepreneurship through the Junior
Achievement program in high school. He started BlackNova Internet Services while
in his senior year, a business he continues to run from his home. He also
detailed his experience in building Delta Point Wireless.

Through contributions by Rotary Clubs and Saskatchewan businesses, the
Saskatchewan Rotary Youth Foundation has delivered $275,000 in scholarships and
business capital grants to young people building a future in Saskatchewan since
its establishment in 2004.

Delta Point Wireless has accumulated enough capital through the three
competitions to launch CareMate without financing.

"We are in the final stage," said Grant.

"We just have to finish up school and be ready for market in the early
springtime."

The company has raised its profile by talking to Saskatoon care homes and
participating in youth competitions.

Grant is confident Delta Point Wireless won't be adversely affected by
stagnating economic activity.

"I don't think it is going to be a huge issue for us," he said.

"There will always be challenges, but health care and senior homes are not
something that is going to go away."

 Overview



     Federal Agency: USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS).

     Funding Opportunity Title: Delta Health Care Services Grant

 Executive Order (EO) 13175 Consultation and Coordination With Indian

 Tribal Governments



     This Executive Order imposes requirements on RD in the development

 of regulatory policies that have tribal implications or preempt tribal

 laws. RD has determined that this Notice does not have a substantial

 direct effect on one or more Indian tribe(s) or on either the

 relationship or the distribution of powers and responsibilities between

 the Federal Government and the Indian tribes. Thus, this Notice is not

 subject to the requirements of Executive Order 13175. Tribal

 Consultation inquiries and comments should be directed to RD's Native

 American Coordinator at aian@wdc.usda.gov or (720) 544-2911.



 Paperwork Reduction Act



     The Paperwork Reduction Act requires Federal agencies to seek and

 obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before

 undertaking a collection of information directed to ten or more

 persons. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44

 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Agency conducted an analysis to determine the

 number of applications the Agency estimates that it will receive under

 the Delta Health Care Services Grant Program. It was determined that

 the estimated number of applications was fewer than nine and in

 accordance with 5 CFR 1320, thus no OMB approval is necessary at this

 time.

 C. Eligibility Information



     Applicants must meet all of the following eligibility requirements.

 Your application will not be considered for funding if it does not

 provide sufficient information to determine eligibility or is missing

 required elements. Applicants that fail to submit the required elements

 by the application deadline will be deemed ineligible and will not be

 evaluated further. Information submitted after the application deadline

 will not be accepted.

 1. Eligible Applicants

     Grants funded through DHCS may be made to a Consortium as defined

 in Paragraph A of this Notice. Consortiums are eligible to receive

 funding through this Notice. One member of the Consortium must be

 designated as the lead entity by the other members of the Consortium

 and have legal authority to contract with the Federal government.

     The lead entity is the recipient (See 2 CFR 200.86) of the DHCS

 grant funds and accountable for monitoring and reporting on the project

 performance and financial management of the grant. In addition, the

 lead entity (recipient) is responsible for subrecipient monitoring and

 management in accordance with 2 CFR 200.330 and 200.331, respectively.

 The remaining consortium members are subrecipients (See 2 CFR 200.93).

 They may receive subawards (See 2 CFR 200.94) from the recipient and

 are responsible for monitoring and reporting the project performance

 and financial management of their subaward to the recipient.

     (a) An applicant is ineligible if they do not submit ``Evidence of

 Eligibility'' and ``Consortium Agreements'' as described in Section

 D.2. of this Notice.

     (b) An applicant is ineligible if they have been debarred or

 suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in

 Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment

 and Suspension.'' The Agency will check the System for Award Management

 (SAM) to determine if the applicant has been debarred or suspended. In

 addition, an applicant will be considered ineligible for a grant due to

 an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other

 than U.S. Tax Court), is delinquent on the payment of Federal income

 taxes, or is delinquent on Federal debt. The applicant must certify as

 part of the application that they do not have an outstanding judgement

 against them. The Agency will check the Credit Alert Interactive Voice

 Response System (CAIVRS) to verify this.

     (c) Any corporation (i) that has been convicted of a felony

 criminal violation under any Federal law within the past 24 months or

 (ii) that has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed,

 for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted

 or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant

 to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax

 liability, is not eligible for financial assistance provided with funds

 appropriated by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations

 Act, 2015, unless a Federal agency has considered suspension or

 debarment of the corporation and has made a determination that this

 further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the

 Government.

     (d) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application

 includes any funding restrictions identified under Section D.6.

     (e) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application is

 not complete in accordance with the requirements stated in Section

 C.3.g.

 2. Cost Sharing or Matching

     Matching funds are not required. However, if you are adding any

 other contributions to the proposed Project, you must provide

 documentation indicating who will be providing the matching funds, the

 amount of funds, when those funds will be provided, and how the funds

 will be used in the project budget. Examples of acceptable

 documentation include: A signed letter from the source of funds stating

 the amount of funds, when the funds will be provided, and what the

 funds can be used for or a signed resolution from your governing board

 authorizing the use of a specified amount of funds for specific

 components of the project. The matching funds you identify must be

 specifically dedicated to the project and cannot include your

 organization's general operating budget. No credit will be given for

 in-kind donations of time, goods, and/or services from any

 organization, including the applicant organization. Additionally, we

 will not consider program income or expected revenue as other

 contributions, unless a commitment letter from the organization that

 will be paying the fees provides a letter stating the amount of the

 funds that will be paid, when they will be paid, and what they can be

 used for, if applicable. If you choose, you may use a template to

 summarize the matching funds. The template is available either from

 your Rural Development State Office or the program Web site at:
http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/delta-health-care-services-grants.

 3. Other Eligibility Requirements

     The following additional eligibility requirements apply to this

 program:

     (a) Use of Funds. An application must propose to use Project funds,

 including grant and other contributions committed under the evaluation

 criteria for eligible purposes. Eligible Project purposes include the

 development of:

      Health care services;

      health education programs;

      health care job training programs; and

      the development and expansion of public health-related

 facilities in the Delta Region.

     (b) Project Area. The proposed Project must take place in a Rural

 Area within the Delta Region as defined in this Notice. However, the

 applicant need not propose to serve the entire Delta Region.

     (c) Project Input. Your proposed Project must be developed based on

 input from local governments, public health care providers, and other

 entities in the Delta Region.

     (d) Grant Period. All grant funds are limited to a 24-month

 performance period. Your proposed grant period should begin no earlier

 than the anticipated award announcement date, March 1, 2016, and should

 end no later than 24 months following that date. If you receive an

 award, your grant period



 [[Page 53768]]



 will be revised to begin on the actual date of award--the date the

 grant agreement is executed by the Agency--and your grant period end

 date will be adjusted accordingly. Your Project activities must begin

 within 90 days of the date of award. If you request funds for a time

 period beginning before March 1, 2016, and/or ending later than 24

 months from that date, your application will be ineligible. The length

 of your grant period should be based on your Project's complexity, as

 indicated in your application work plan.

     (e) Multiple Grant Requests. The Consortium, including its members,

 is limited to submitting one application for funding under this Notice.

 We will not accept applications from Consortiums that include members

 who are also members of other Consortiums that have submitted

 applications for funding under this Notice. If we discover that a

 Consortium member is a member of multiple Consortiums with applications

 submitted for funding under this Notice, all applications will be

 considered ineligible for funding.

     (f) Performance on Existing DHCS Awards. If the lead entity, or any

 of its Consortium members, has an existing DHCS award, they must be

 performing satisfactorily to be considered eligible for a funding under

 this Notice. Satisfactory performance includes, but is not limited to,

 being up-to-date on all financial and performance reports and being

 current on all tasks as approved in the work plan. The Agency will use

 its discretion to make this determination.

     (g) Completeness. Your application must provide all of the

 information requested in Section D.2. of this Notice. Applications

 lacking sufficient information to determine eligibility and scoring

 will be deemed ineligible and will not be considered for scoring.

     (h) Indirect Costs. Your negotiated indirect cost rate approval

 does not need to be included in your application, but you will be

 required to provide it if a grant is awarded. Approval for indirect

 costs that are requested in an application without an approved indirect

 cost rate agreement is at the discretion of the Agency.

 [[Page 53770]]



 5. Intergovernmental Review

     Executive Order (EO) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal

 Programs, applies to this program. This EO requires that Federal

 agencies provide opportunities for consultation on proposed assistance

 with State and local governments. Many States have established a Single

 Point of Contact (SPOC) to facilitate this consultation. A list of

 States that maintain a SPOC may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants_spoc. If your State has a SPOC, you may

 submit your application directly for review. Any comments obtained

 through the SPOC must be provided to Rural Development for

 consideration as part of your application. If your State has not

 established a SPOC or you do not want to submit your application to the

 SPOC, Rural Development will submit your application to the SPOC or

 other appropriate agency or agencies.

     You are also encouraged to contact Cooperative Programs at 202-690-

 1376 or cpgrants@wdc.usda.gov if you have questions about this process.

 6. Funding Restrictions

     The use of project funds, including grant funds and other

 contributions, cannot be used for ineligible purposes. In addition, you

 shall not use project funds for the following:

     (a) To duplicate current services or to replace or to substitute

 support previously provided. If the current service is inadequate,

 however, project funds may be used to expand the level of effort or a

 service beyond what is currently being provided;

     (b) To pay for costs to prepare the application for funding under

 this Notice;

     (c) To pay for costs of the project incurred prior to the effective

 date of the period of performance;

     (d) To pay expenses for applicant employee training;

     (e) Fund political activities;

     (f) To pay for assistance to any private business enterprise which

 does not have at least 51 percent ownership by those who are either

 citizens of the United States or reside in the United States after

 being legally admitted for permanent residence;

     (g) To pay any judgment or debt owed to the United States.

     (h) Engage in any activities that are considered a Conflict of

 Interest, as defined by this Notice; or

     (i) Fund any activities prohibited by 2 CFR 200.

     In addition, your application will not be considered for funding if

 it does any of the following:

      Requests more than the maximum grant amount: or

      Proposes ineligible costs that equal more than 10 percent

 of the project funds.

     If you include funds in your budget that are for ineligible

 purposes, we will consider the application for funding if the

 ineligible purposes total 10 percent or less of an applicant's project

 funds. However, if the application is successful, those ineligible

 costs must be removed from the work plan and budget and replaced with

 eligible costs before we will make the grant award, or the grant award

 will be reduced accordingly. If we cannot determine the percentage of

 ineligible costs, the application will not be considered for funding.

 7. Other Submission Requirements

     (a) You should not submit your application in more than one format.

 You must choose whether to submit your application in hard copy or

 electronically. Applications submitted in hard copy should be mailed or

 hand-delivered to the State Office where the project will primarily

 take place. You can find State Office contact information at:
http://www.rd.usda.gov/contact-us/state-offices. To submit an application

 electronically, you must follow the instructions for this funding

 announcement at http://www.grants.gov. A password is not required to

 access the Web site.

     (b) National Environmental Policy Act.

     This Notice has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940,

 subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' We have determined that an

 Environmental Impact Statement is not required because the issuance of

 regulations and instructions, as well as amendments to them, describing

 administrative and financial procedures for processing, approving, and

 implementing the Agency's financial programs is categorically excluded

 in the Agency's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation

 found at 7 CFR 1940.310(e)(3) of subpart G, ``Environmental Program.''

 We have determined that this Notice does not constitute a major Federal

 action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

 Non-construction projects applying under this Notice are hereby

 classified as Categorical Exclusions according to 7 CFR 1940.310(e),

 the award of financial assistance for planning purposes, management and

 feasibility studies, or environmental impact analyses, which do not

 require any additional documentation.

     (c) Civil Rights Compliance Requirements.

     All grants made under this Notice are subject to Title VI of the

 Civil Rights Act of 1964 as required by the USDA (7 CFR part 15,

 subpart A) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.



 E. Application Review Information



     We will review your application to determine if it is complete and

 eligible. If at any time we determine that your application is

 ineligible, you will be notified in writing as to the reasons it was

 determined ineligible and you will be informed of your review and

 appeal rights.

     We will only score applications in which the lead entity,

 partnering Consortium member entities, and the project are eligible.

 The applications must also be complete and sufficiently responsive to

 program requirements.

     We will review each application to determine if it is eligible for

 funding and complete, based on the requirements of this Notice as well

 as other applicable Federal regulations.

     Applications that are determined to be eligible and complete will

 be evaluated based on the criteria described below.

 1. Criteria

     For each criterion, you must show how the Project has merit and why

 it is likely to be successful. If you do not address all parts of a

 criterion your application will be deemed ineligible. If you do not

 sufficiently communicate relevant Project information, you will receive

 lower scores. DHCS is a competitive program, so you will receive scores

 based on the quality of your responses. Simply addressing the criteria

 will not guarantee higher scores. The maximum number of points that can

 be awarded to your application is 100. For this announcement, the

 minimum score requirement for funding is 60 points. It is at the

 Agency's discretion to fund applications with a score of 59 or less if

 it is in the best interest of the Federal government.

     The evaluation criteria are detailed in the DHCS Grant Application

 Guide which can be found at http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants. You must address each evaluation

 criterion outlined in this Notice. Any criterion not substantively

 addressed will receive zero points. There are three criteria totaling

 100 points. They are listed below:

     (a) Rurality of the Project and communities served (maximum of 30

 points)--The rurality of the communities served by the Project is an



 [[Page 53771]]



 objective criterion that measures the rurality of the Project's service

 area. It is determined by the population of the community. The rurality

 calculation provided in the application will be checked and, if

 necessary, corrected by us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------



     (b) The Community Needs and Benefits derived from the Project

 (maximum of 30 points)--We will assess how the Project's purpose and

 goals benefit the residents in the Delta Region. This criterion will be

 scored based on the documentation in support of the community needs for

 health services and public health-related facilities and the benefits

 to people living in Delta Regional derived from the implementation of

 the proposed Project. It should lead clearly to the identification of

 the Project participant pool and the target population for the Project,

 and provide convincing links between the Project and the benefits to

 the community to address its health needs. RBS will consider:

     (1) The extent of the applicant's documentation explaining the

 health care needs, issues, and challenges facing the service area.

 Include what problems the residents face and how the Project will

 benefit the residents in the region.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant is able to show the

 relationship between the Project's design, outcome, and benefits.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant explains the Project and its

 implementation and provides milestones which are well-defined and can

 be realistically completed.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant clearly outlines a plan to

 track, report, and evaluate performance outcomes.

     Applicants should attempt to quantify benefits in terms of outcomes

 from the Project; that is, ways in which peoples' lives, or the

 community, will be improved. Provide estimates of the number of people

 affected by the benefits arising from the project. The Agency has also

 established annual performance measures to evaluate the DHCS program.

 Use this section to provide estimates on the following performance

 measures as part of your narrative:

      Number of businesses assisted;

      Number of jobs created;

      Number of jobs saved;

      Number of individuals assisted/trained.

     It is permissible to have a zero in a performance element. When you

 calculate jobs created, estimates should be based upon actual jobs to

 be created by your organization as a result of the DHCS funding or

 actual jobs to be created by businesses as a result of assistance from

 your organization. When you calculate jobs saved, estimates should be

 based only on actual jobs that would have been lost if your

 organization did not receive DHCS funding or actual jobs that would

 have been lost without assistance from your organization.

     You can also suggest additional performance elements for example

 where job creation or jobs saved may not be a relevant indicator. These

 additional criteria should be specific, measurable performance elements

 that could be included in an award document.

     (c) The Project Management and Organization Capability (maximum of

 40 points)--We will evaluate the Consortium's experience, past

 performance, and accomplishments addressing health care issues to

 ensure effective Project implementation. This criterion will be scored

 based on the documentation of the Project's management and

 organizational capability. RBS will consider:

     (1) The degree to which the organization has a sound management and

 fiscal structure including: well-defined roles for administrators,

 staff, and established financial management systems.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant identifies and demonstrates

 that qualifications, capabilities, and educational background of the

 identified key personnel (at a minimum the Project Manager) who will

 manage and implement programs are relevant and will contribute to the

 success of the Project.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates current

 successful and effective experience (or recent past experience)

 addressing the health care issues in the Delta Region.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant has experience managing

 grant-funded programs.

     (5) The extent to which the applicant is able to correlate and

 support the budget to the project phases and implementation timeline.

     (6) The extent to which administrative/management costs are

 balanced with funds designated for the provision of programs and

 services.

     (7) The extent and depth of membership in the applicant's

 Consortium of regional institutions of higher education, academic

 health and research institutes and economic development entities

 located in the Delta Region.

 2. Review and Selection Process

     The State Offices will review applications to determine if they are

 eligible for assistance based on requirements in this Notice and other

 applicable Federal regulations. If determined eligible, your

 application will be scored by a panel of National and State Office

 employees in accordance with the point allocation specified in this

 Notice. A recommendation will be submitted to the Administrator to fund

 applications in highest ranking order, subject to availability of

 funds. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund applications with a

 score of 59 or less if it is in the best interest of the Federal

 government. If your application is evaluated, but not funded, it will

 not be carried forward into the next competition.



 F. Federal Award Administration Information

Community Health Workers first class;
Federal grant program providing health care access graduates first class of
Community Health Workers

BYLINE: The Foothills Sun-Gazette staff

LENGTH: 323  words


The Workforce Investment Board of Tulare County (WIB) held the first graduation
for its Community Health Worker Program last Thursday, April 26, at College of
the Sequoias (COS). The program was designed to train students to connect
communities to health-related information and services.

"This is an overdue recognition of a vital part of our health care delivery
system," said Kerry Hydash, Chief Human Resources Officer at Family Health Care
Network, and chair of the WIB's Health Care Sector Committee.

The training included diverse skills and topics, including advocacy,
communication, health care terminology and administration, cultural topics,
nutrition, and basic first aid. The curriculum for the training was developed by
the CSU-Fresno Department of Public Health and COS.

"These amazing women have special talents and unique gifts of their own," said
Elia Escalante, one of the graduates of the program, who is already employed at
Kaweah Delta as a community health worker. "These unique gifts we all have allow
us to shine bright and I know we will be a beacon of light to our community."

The program was funded with a grant awarded to the WIB in May, 2011. The funding
came originally from the U.S. Department of Labor, through the California
Employment Development Department, with the WIB receiving a total of $547,500.

"All 17 graduating students showed enthusiasm and dedication to completing the
18-week course," said Alma Torres-Nguyen, with the Kaweah Delta Health Care
District, and the lead instructor for the training. "They are excited about
starting their work to help make Tulare County a healthier place to live."

The grant will also fund a research project to identify appropriate wage levels,
auxiliary career opportunities, standardized training thresholds, and an overall
evaluation of the training program development by CSUF and COS. For more
information, call the WIB at 713.5200, or email info@tularewib.org

Strong health center receives grant

BYLINE: The Original Irregular staff

LENGTH: 289  words


WATERVILLE -- The Northeast Delta Dental Foundation recently awarded a grant to
Strong Area Health and Dental Center, one of the 11 practices of HealthReach
Community Health Centers. The award will assist in the purchase of a new
panoramic x-ray system integrated into the electronic dental records of the
practice. "We appreciate the foundation's support to provide state of the art
equipment for the patients in our rural community," said President/CEO of
HealthReach, Connie Coggins.

"There is a tremendous shortage of oral health care in Maine, particularly in
rural communities. Strong Dental received support for its startup in 2003 from
federal, state and community partners and continues to attract generous
benefactors to assist us in providing sensitive, patient-centered services to
people of all ages," shared Coggins. Strong Dental provides comprehensive dental
services from cleanings to filling to restorations. The dental center accepts
all insurances, including MaineCare, and also offers sliding fee services to
people who qualify based on family size and income.

In addition to providing dental services to patients, Strong Dental takes a
leadership role in community education and prevention initiatives. Dental staff
participates in school and pre-school education programs. The center is also
committed to the education of future dentists and hygienists and providing
clinical rotation opportunities at the center.

"We are happy we are able to support Strong Area Health and Dental Center to
help improve access to oral health care in rural Maine and commend them on their
work to make high quality health care available to these communities," said
Kathleen Walker, treasurer of the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation.

 Overview



     Federal Agency: USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS).

     Funding Opportunity Title: Delta Health Care Services Grant

 Program.

     Announcement Type: Initial funding announcement.

     Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 10.874.

     Dates: You must submit your complete application by November 14,

 Executive Order (EO) 13175 Consultation and Coordination With Indian

 Tribal Governments



     This Executive Order imposes requirements on RD in the development

 of regulatory policies that have tribal implications or preempt tribal

 laws. RD has determined that this Notice does not have a substantial

 direct effect on one or more Indian tribe(s) or on either the

 relationship or the distribution of powers and responsibilities between

 the Federal Government and the Indian tribes. Thus, this Notice is not

 subject to the requirements of Executive Order 13175. Tribal

 Consultation inquiries and comments should be directed to RD's Native

 American Coordinator at aian@wdc.usda.gov or (720) 544-2911.



 Paperwork Reduction Act



     The Paperwork Reduction Act requires Federal agencies to seek and

 obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before

 undertaking a collection of information directed to ten or more

 persons. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44

 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Agency conducted an analysis to determine the

 number of applications the Agency estimates that it will receive under

 the Delta Health Care Services Grant Program. It was determined that

 the estimated number of applications was fewer than nine and in

 accordance with 5 CFR 1320, thus no OMB approval is necessary at this

 time.



 A. Program Description



     This Notice announces the availability of funds for the DHCS grant

 program, which is authorized under Section 379G of the Consolidated

 Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2008u). The primary objective

 related variables such as land values. These activities shall primarily

 benefit low- and moderate-income individuals in the Delta Region.

     Health System means the complete network of agencies, facilities,

 and all providers of health care to meet the health needs of a specific

 geographical area or target populations.

 C. Eligibility Information



     Applicants must meet all of the following eligibility requirements.

 Your application will not be considered for funding if it does not

 provide sufficient information to determine eligibility or is missing

 required elements. Applicants that fail to submit the required elements

 by the application deadline will be deemed ineligible and will not be

 evaluated further. Information submitted after the application deadline

 will not be accepted.



 1. Eligible Applicants



     Grants funded through DHCS may be made to a Consortium as defined

 in Paragraph A of this Notice. Consortiums are eligible to receive

 funding through this Notice. One member of the Consortium must be

 designated as the lead entity by the other members of the Consortium

 and have legal authority to contract with the Federal government.

     The lead entity is the recipient (see 2 CFR 200.86) of the DHCS

 grant funds and accountable for monitoring and reporting on the project

 performance and financial management of the grant. In addition, the

 lead entity (recipient) is responsible for subrecipient monitoring and

 management in accordance with 2 CFR 200.330 and 200.331, respectively.

 The remaining consortium members are subrecipients (see 2 CFR 200.93).

 They may receive subawards (see 2 CFR 200.94) from the recipient and

 are responsible for monitoring and reporting the project performance

 and financial management of their subaward to the recipient.

     (a) An applicant is ineligible if they do not submit ``Evidence of

 Eligibility'' and ``Consortium Agreements'' as described in Section

 D.2. of this Notice.

     (b) An applicant is ineligible if they have been debarred or

 suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in

 Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment

 and Suspension.'' The Agency will check the System for Award Management

 (SAM) to determine if the applicant has been debarred or suspended. In

 addition, an applicant will be considered ineligible for a grant due to

 an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other

 than U.S. Tax Court), is delinquent on the payment of Federal income

 taxes, or is delinquent on Federal debt. The applicant must certify as

 part of the application that they do not have an outstanding judgment

 against them. The Agency will check the Credit Alert Interactive Voice

 Response System (CAIVRS) to verify this.

     (c) Sections 743, 744, 745, and 746 of the Consolidated

 Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113) apply. Any corporation (i)

 that has been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any

 Federal law within the past 24 months or (ii) that has any unpaid

 Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial

 and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and

 that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with

 the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, is not

 eligible for financial assistance provided with funds appropriated by

 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), unless a

 Federal agency has considered suspension or debarment of the

 corporation and has made a determination that this further action is

 not necessary to protect the interests of the Government. In addition,

 none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or

 any other Act may be available for a contract, grant, or cooperative

 agreement with an entity that requires employees or contractors of such

 entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal

 confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise

 restricting such employees or contractors from lawfully



 [[Page 62857]]



 reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or

 law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency

 authorized to receive such information. Additionally, no funds

 appropriated in this or any other Act may be used to implement or

 enforce the agreements in Standard Forms 312 and 4414 of the Government

 or any other nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement if such policy,

 form, or agreement does not contain the following provisions: ``These

 provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or

 otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities

 created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1)

 classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the

 reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or

 regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of

 authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or

 safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection.

     (d) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application

 includes any funding restrictions identified under Section D.6.

     (e) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application is

 not complete in accordance with the requirements stated in Section

 C.3.g.



 2. Cost Sharing or Matching



     Matching funds are not required. However, if you are adding any

 other contributions to the proposed Project, you must provide

 documentation indicating who will be providing the matching funds, the

 amount of funds, when those funds will be provided, and how the funds

 will be used in the project budget. Examples of acceptable

 documentation include: A signed letter from the source of funds stating

 the amount of funds, when the funds will be provided, and what the

 funds can be used for or a signed resolution from your governing board

 authorizing the use of a specified amount of funds for specific

 components of the project. The matching funds you identify must be for

 eligible purposes and included in your work plan and budget.

 Additionally, expected program income may not be used as matching funds

 at the time you submit your application. However, if you have a

 contract to provide services in place at the time you submit your

 application, you can verify the amount of the contract as matching

 funds. If you choose, you may use a template to summarize the matching

 funds. The template is available either from your Rural Development

 State Office or the program Web site at: http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants.



 3. Other Eligibility Requirements



     The following additional eligibility requirements apply to this

 program:

     (a) Use of Funds. An application must propose to use Project funds,

 including grant and other contributions committed under the evaluation

 criteria for eligible purposes. Eligible Project purposes include the

 development of:

      Health care services;

      health education programs;

      health care job training programs; and

      the development and expansion of public health-related

 facilities in the Delta Region.

     (b) Project Area. The proposed Project must take place in a Rural

 Area within the Delta Region as defined in this Notice. However, the

 applicant need not propose to serve the entire Delta Region.

     (c) Project Input. Your proposed Project must be developed based on

 input from local governments, public health care providers, and other

 entities in the Delta Region.

     (d) Grant Period. All awards are limited to up to a 24-month grant

 period based upon the complexity of the project. Your proposed grant

 period should begin no earlier than October 1, 2016, and should end no

 later than 24 months following that date. If you receive an award, your

 grant period will be revised to begin on the actual date of award--the

 date the grant agreement is executed by the Agency--and your grant

 period end date will be adjusted accordingly. Your Project activities

 must begin within 90 days of the date of award. If you request funds

 for a time period beginning before October 1, 2016, and/or ending later

 than 24 months from that date, your application will be ineligible. The

 length of your grant period should be based on your Project's

 complexity, as indicated in your application work plan.

     (e) Multiple Grant Requests. The Consortium, including its members,

 is limited to submitting one application for funding under this Notice.

 We will not accept applications from Consortiums that include members

 who are also members of other Consortiums that have submitted

 applications for funding under this Notice. If we discover that a

 Consortium member is a member of multiple Consortiums with applications

 submitted for funding under this Notice, all applications will be

 considered ineligible for funding.

     (f) Performance on Existing DHCS Awards. If the lead entity, or any

 of its Consortium members, has an existing DHCS award, they must be

 performing satisfactorily to be considered eligible for a funding under

 this Notice. Satisfactory performance includes, but is not limited to,

 being up-to-date on all financial and performance reports and being

 current on all tasks as approved in the work plan. The Agency will use

 its discretion to make this determination.

     (g) Completeness. Your application must provide all of the

 information requested in Section D.2. of this Notice. Applications

 lacking sufficient information to determine eligibility and scoring

 will be deemed ineligible and will not be considered for scoring.

     (h) Indirect Costs. Your negotiated indirect cost rate approval

 does not need to be included in your application, but you will be

 required to provide it if a grant is awarded. Approval for indirect

 costs that are requested in an application without an approved indirect

 cost rate agreement is at the discretion of the Agency.

 written agreement with each Consortium member that addresses the

 negotiated arrangements for administering the Project to meet Project

 goals, the Consortium member's responsibilities to comply with

 administrative, financial, and reporting requirements of the grant,

 including those necessary to ensure compliance with all applicable

 Federal regulations and policies, and facilitate a smooth functioning

 collaborative venture. Under the agreement, each Consortium member must

 perform a substantive role in the Project and not merely serve as a

      Number of jobs created;

      Number of jobs saved;

      Number of individuals assisted/trained.

     It is permissible to have a zero in a performance element. When you

 calculate jobs created, estimates should be based upon actual jobs to

 be created by your organization as a result of the DHCS funding or

 actual jobs to be created by businesses as a result of assistance from

 your organization. When you calculate jobs saved, estimates should be

 based only on actual jobs that would have been lost if your

 organization did not receive DHCS funding or actual jobs that would

 have been lost without assistance from your organization.

     You can also suggest additional performance elements for example

 where job creation or jobs saved may not be a relevant indicator. These

 additional elements should be specific, measurable performance elements

 that could be included in an award document.

     (m) Financial information and sustainability. You must provide

 current financial statements and a narrative description demonstrating

     4. Submission Date and Time.

     Application Deadline Date: November 14, 2016.

     Explanation of Deadlines: Complete paper applications must be

 postmarked and mailed, shipped, or sent overnight by November 14, 2016.

 The Agency will determine whether your application is late based on the

 accept applications submitted after the deadline.

     5. Intergovernmental Review.

     Executive Order (EO) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal

 Programs, applies to this program. This EO requires that Federal

 agencies provide opportunities for consultation on proposed assistance

 with State and local governments. Many States have established a Single

 Point of Contact (SPOC) to facilitate this consultation. A list of

 States that maintain a SPOC may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants_spoc. If your State has a SPOC, you may

 submit your application directly for review. Any comments obtained

 through the SPOC must be provided to Rural Development for

 consideration as part of your application. If your State has not

 established a SPOC or you do not want to submit your application to the

 SPOC, Rural Development will submit your application to the SPOC or

 other appropriate agency or agencies.

     You are also encouraged to contact Cooperative Programs at 202-690-

 1374 or cpgrants@wdc.usda.gov if you have questions about this process.

     6. Funding Restrictions.

     The use of project funds, including grant funds and other

 contributions, cannot be used for ineligible purposes. In addition, you

 shall not use project funds for the following:

     (a) To duplicate current services or to replace or to substitute

 support previously provided. However, project funds may be used to

 expand the level of effort or a service beyond what is currently being

 provided;

     (b) To pay for costs to prepare the application for funding under

 this Notice;

     (c) To pay for costs of the project incurred prior to the effective

 date of the period of performance;

     (d) To pay expenses for applicant employee training;

     (e) Fund political activities;

     (f) To pay for assistance to any private business enterprise which

 does not have at least 51 percent ownership by those who are either

 citizens of the United States or reside in the United States after

 being legally admitted for permanent residence;

     (g) To pay any judgment or debt owed to the United States;

     (h) Engage in any activities that are considered a Conflict of

 Interest, as defined by this Notice; or

     (i) Fund any activities prohibited by 2 CFR 200;

     In addition, your application will not be considered for funding if

 it does any of the following:

      Requests more than the maximum grant amount: or



 [[Page 62860]]



      Proposes ineligible costs that equal more than 10 percent

 of the project funds.

     If you include funds in your budget that are for ineligible

 purposes, we will consider the application for funding if the

 ineligible purposes total 10 percent or less of an applicant's project

 funds. However, if the application is successful, those ineligible

 costs must be removed from the work plan and budget and replaced with

 eligible costs before we will make the grant award, or the grant award

 will be reduced accordingly. If we cannot determine the percentage of

 ineligible costs, the application will not be considered for funding.

     7. Other Submission Requirements.

     (a) You should not submit your application in more than one format.

 You must choose whether to submit your application in hard copy or

 electronically. Applications submitted in hard copy should be mailed or

 take place. You can find State Office contact information at:
http://www.rd.usda.gov/contact-us/state-offices. To submit an application

 electronically, you must follow the instructions for this funding

 announcement at http://www.grants.gov. A password is not required to

 access the Web site.

     (b) National Environmental Policy Act.

     This Notice has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970,

 ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.'' We have determined that an

 Environmental Impact Statement is not required because the issuance of

 regulations and instructions, as well as amendments to them, describing

 administrative and financial procedures for processing, approving, and

 implementing the Agency's financial programs is categorically excluded

 in the Agency's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation

 found at 7 CFR 1970.53(f), ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.''

 We have determined that this Notice does not constitute a major Federal

 action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

     (c) Civil Rights Compliance Requirements.

     All grants made under this Notice are subject to Title VI of the

 Civil Rights Act of 1964 as required by the USDA (7 CFR part 15,

 subpart A) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title

 VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Title IX, Executive Order 13166

 (Limited English Proficiency), Executive Order 11246, and the Equal

 Credit Opportunity Act of 1974.



 E. Application Review Information



     We will review your application to determine if it is complete and

 eligible. If at any time we determine that your application is

 ineligible, you will be notified in writing as to the reasons it was

 determined ineligible and you will be informed of your review and

 appeal rights.

     We will only score applications in which the lead entity,

 partnering Consortium member entities, and the project are eligible.

 The applications must also be complete and sufficiently responsive to

 program requirements.

     We will review each application to determine if it is eligible for

 funding and complete, based on the requirements of this Notice as well

 as other applicable Federal regulations.

     Applications that are determined to be eligible and complete will

 be evaluated based on the criteria described below.

     1. Criteria.

     For each criterion, you must show how the Project has merit and why

 it is likely to be successful. If you do not address all parts of a

 criterion your application will be deemed ineligible. If you do not

 sufficiently communicate relevant Project information, you will receive

 lower scores. DHCS is a competitive program, so you will receive scores

 based on the quality of your responses. Simply addressing the criteria

 will not guarantee higher scores. Evaluators will base scores only on

 the information provided or cross-referenced by page number in each

 individual evaluation criterion. The maximum number of points that can

 be awarded to your application is 100. The minimum score requirement

 for funding is 60 points. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund

 applications with a score of 59 points or less if it is in the best

 interest of the Federal government.

     The evaluation criteria are detailed in the DHCS Grant Application

 Guide which can be found at http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants. You must address each evaluation

 criterion outlined in this Notice. Any criterion not substantively

 addressed will receive zero points. There are three criteria totaling

 100 points. They are listed below:

     (a) Rurality of the Project and communities served (maximum of 30

 points)--The rurality of the communities served by the Project is an

 objective criterion that measures the rurality of the Project's service

 area. It is determined by the population of the community based upon

 the 2010 U.S. Census data available on the American Fact Finder Web

 site--http://www.factfinder.census.gov. If you have multiple addresses

 in the same community (city, town or census designated place), please

 only list the community once when preparing your rurality calculation.

 The rurality calculation provided in the application will be checked

 and, if necessary, corrected by us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------



     (b) The Community Needs and Benefits derived from the Project

 (maximum of 30 points)--We will assess how the Project will benefit the

 residents in the Delta Region. This criterion will be scored based on

 the documentation in support of the community needs for health services

 and public health-related facilities and the benefits to people living

 in Delta Regional derived from the implementation of the proposed

 Project. It should lead clearly to the identification of the Project

 participant pool and the target population for the Project, and provide

 convincing links between the Project and the benefits to the community

 to address its health needs. RBS will consider:

     (1) The extent of the applicant's documentation explaining the

 health care needs, issues, and challenges facing the service area.

 Include what problems



 [[Page 62861]]



 the residents face and how the Project will benefit the residents in

 the region.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant is able to show the

 relationship between the Project's design, outcome, and benefits.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant explains the Project and its

 implementation and provides milestones which are well-defined and can

 be realistically completed.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant clearly outlines a plan to

 track, report, and evaluate performance outcomes.

     Applicants should attempt to quantify benefits in terms of outcomes

 from the Project; that is, ways in which peoples' lives, or the

 community, will be improved. Provide estimates of the number of people

 affected by the benefits arising from the project.

     (c) The Project Management and Organization Capability (maximum of

 40 points)--We will evaluate the Consortium's experience, past

 performance, and accomplishments addressing health care issues to

 ensure effective Project implementation. This criterion will be scored

 based on the documentation of the Project's management and

 organizational capability. RBS will consider:

     (1) The degree to which the organization has a sound management and

 fiscal structure including: Well-defined roles for administrators,

 staff, and established financial management systems.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant identifies and demonstrates

 that qualifications, capabilities, and educational background of the

 identified key personnel (at a minimum the Project Manager) who will

 manage and implement programs are relevant and will contribute to the

 success of the Project.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates current

 successful and effective experience (or demonstrated experience within

 the past 5 years) addressing the health care issues in the Delta

 Region.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant has experience managing

 grant-funded programs.

     (5) The extent to which the applicant is able to correlate and

 support the budget to the project phases and implementation timeline.

     (6) The extent to which administrative/management costs are

 balanced with funds designated for the provision of programs and

 services.

     (7) The extent and diversity of eligible entity types within the

 applicant's Consortium of regional institutions of higher education,

 academic health and research institutes and economic development

 entities located in the Delta Region.

     2. Review and Selection Process.

     The State Offices will review applications to determine if they are

 eligible for assistance based on requirements in this Notice and other

 applicable Federal regulations. If determined eligible, your

 application will be scored by a panel of National and State Office

 employees in accordance with the point allocation specified in this

 Notice. A recommendation will be submitted to the Administrator to fund

 applications in highest ranking order, subject to availability of

 funds. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund applications with a

 score of 59 points or less if it is in the best interest of the Federal

 government. If your application is evaluated, but not funded, it will

 not be carried forward into the next competition.



 F. Federal Award Administration Information



     1. Federal Award Notices.

     If you are selected for funding, you will receive a signed notice

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 Overview



     Federal Agency: USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS).

     Funding Opportunity Title: Delta Health Care Services Grant

 Program.

     Announcement Type: Initial funding announcement.

     Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 10.874.

     Dates: You must submit your complete application by November 14,

 2016 or it will not be considered for funding. Electronic copies must

 November 7, 2016 or it will not be considered for funding.



 Executive Order (EO) 13175 Consultation and Coordination With Indian

 Tribal Governments



     This Executive Order imposes requirements on RD in the development

 of regulatory policies that have tribal implications or preempt tribal

 laws. RD has determined that this Notice does not have a substantial

 direct effect on one or more Indian tribe(s) or on either the

 relationship or the distribution of powers and responsibilities between

 the Federal Government and the Indian tribes. Thus, this Notice is not

 subject to the requirements of Executive Order 13175. Tribal

 Consultation inquiries and comments should be directed to RD's Native

 American Coordinator at aian@wdc.usda.gov or (720) 544-2911.



 Paperwork Reduction Act



     The Paperwork Reduction Act requires Federal agencies to seek and

 obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before

 undertaking a collection of information directed to ten or more

 persons. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44

 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Agency conducted an analysis to determine the

 number of applications the Agency estimates that it will receive under

 the Delta Health Care Services Grant Program. It was determined that

 the estimated number of applications was fewer than nine and in

 accordance with 5 CFR 1320, thus no OMB approval is necessary at this

 time.



 A. Program Description



     This Notice announces the availability of funds for the DHCS grant

 program, which is authorized under Section 379G of the Consolidated

 Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2008u). The primary objective

 of the program is to provide financial assistance to address the

 continued unmet health needs in the Delta Region through cooperation

 among health care professionals, institutions of higher education,

 research institutions, and other individuals and entities in the Delta

 Region. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. The maximum award

 amount per grant is $1,000,000.



 Definitions

 interest for owners, employees, officers, agents, or their immediate

 family members having a financial or other interest in the outcome of

 the project; or that restrict open and free competition for

 unrestrained trade. Specifically, project funds may not be used for

 services or goods going to, or coming from, a person or entity with a

 real or apparent conflict of interest, including, but not limited to,

 owner(s) and their immediate family members. An example of conflict of

 interest occurs when the consortium member's employees, board of

 http://dra.gov/about-dra/dra-states.

     Economic Development Entity means any public or non-profit

 organization whose primary mission is to stimulate local and regional

 economies within the Delta Region by increasing employment

 opportunities and duration of employment, expanding or retaining

 existing employers, increasing labor rates or wage levels, reducing

 outmigration, and/or creating gains in other economic development-

 related variables such as land values. These activities shall primarily

 benefit low- and moderate-income individuals in the Delta Region.

     Health System means the complete network of agencies, facilities,

 and all providers of health care to meet the health needs of a specific

 geographical area or target populations.

     Institution of Higher Education means either a postsecondary (post-

 high school) educational institution that awards a bachelor's degree or

 provides not less than a 2-year program that is acceptable for full

 credit toward such a degree, or a postsecondary vocational institution

 that provides a program of training to prepare students for gainful

 employment in a recognized occupation.

     Nonprofit Organization means any organization or institution,

 Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Public Law 110-246 (June 18,

 2008).

      For the purposes of this definition, cities and towns are

 incorporated population centers with definite boundaries, local self-

 government, and legal powers set forth in a charter granted by the

 State.

     State means each of the 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,

 the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, American Samoa, the

 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and, as may be determined

 by the Secretary to be feasible, appropriate and lawful, the Federated

 States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the

 C. Eligibility Information



     Applicants must meet all of the following eligibility requirements.

 Your application will not be considered for funding if it does not

 provide sufficient information to determine eligibility or is missing

 required elements. Applicants that fail to submit the required elements

 by the application deadline will be deemed ineligible and will not be

 evaluated further. Information submitted after the application deadline

 will not be accepted.



 1. Eligible Applicants



     Grants funded through DHCS may be made to a Consortium as defined

 in Paragraph A of this Notice. Consortiums are eligible to receive

 funding through this Notice. One member of the Consortium must be

 designated as the lead entity by the other members of the Consortium

 and have legal authority to contract with the Federal government.

     The lead entity is the recipient (see 2 CFR 200.86) of the DHCS

 grant funds and accountable for monitoring and reporting on the project

 performance and financial management of the grant. In addition, the

 lead entity (recipient) is responsible for subrecipient monitoring and

 management in accordance with 2 CFR 200.330 and 200.331, respectively.

 The remaining consortium members are subrecipients (see 2 CFR 200.93).

 They may receive subawards (see 2 CFR 200.94) from the recipient and

 are responsible for monitoring and reporting the project performance

 and financial management of their subaward to the recipient.

     (a) An applicant is ineligible if they do not submit ``Evidence of

 Eligibility'' and ``Consortium Agreements'' as described in Section

 D.2. of this Notice.

     (b) An applicant is ineligible if they have been debarred or

 suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in

 Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment

 and Suspension.'' The Agency will check the System for Award Management

 (SAM) to determine if the applicant has been debarred or suspended. In

 addition, an applicant will be considered ineligible for a grant due to

 an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other

 than U.S. Tax Court), is delinquent on the payment of Federal income

 taxes, or is delinquent on Federal debt. The applicant must certify as

 part of the application that they do not have an outstanding judgment

 against them. The Agency will check the Credit Alert Interactive Voice

 Response System (CAIVRS) to verify this.

     (c) Sections 743, 744, 745, and 746 of the Consolidated

 Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113) apply. Any corporation (i)

 that has been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any

 Federal law within the past 24 months or (ii) that has any unpaid

 Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial

 and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and

 that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with

 the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, is not

 eligible for financial assistance provided with funds appropriated by

 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), unless a

 Federal agency has considered suspension or debarment of the

 corporation and has made a determination that this further action is

 not necessary to protect the interests of the Government. In addition,

 none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or

 any other Act may be available for a contract, grant, or cooperative

 agreement with an entity that requires employees or contractors of such

 entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal

 confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise

 restricting such employees or contractors from lawfully



 [[Page 62857]]



 reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or

 law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency

 authorized to receive such information. Additionally, no funds

 appropriated in this or any other Act may be used to implement or

 enforce the agreements in Standard Forms 312 and 4414 of the Government

 or any other nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement if such policy,

 form, or agreement does not contain the following provisions: ``These

 provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or

 otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities

 created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1)

 classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the

 reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or

 regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of

 authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or

 safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection.

     (d) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application

 includes any funding restrictions identified under Section D.6.

     (e) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application is

 not complete in accordance with the requirements stated in Section

 C.3.g.



 2. Cost Sharing or Matching



     Matching funds are not required. However, if you are adding any

 other contributions to the proposed Project, you must provide

 documentation indicating who will be providing the matching funds, the

 amount of funds, when those funds will be provided, and how the funds

 will be used in the project budget. Examples of acceptable

 documentation include: A signed letter from the source of funds stating

 the amount of funds, when the funds will be provided, and what the

 funds can be used for or a signed resolution from your governing board

 authorizing the use of a specified amount of funds for specific

 components of the project. The matching funds you identify must be for

 eligible purposes and included in your work plan and budget.

 Additionally, expected program income may not be used as matching funds

 at the time you submit your application. However, if you have a

 contract to provide services in place at the time you submit your

 application, you can verify the amount of the contract as matching

 funds. If you choose, you may use a template to summarize the matching

 funds. The template is available either from your Rural Development

 State Office or the program Web site at: http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants.



 3. Other Eligibility Requirements



     The following additional eligibility requirements apply to this

 program:

     (a) Use of Funds. An application must propose to use Project funds,

 including grant and other contributions committed under the evaluation

 criteria for eligible purposes. Eligible Project purposes include the

 development of:

      Health care services;

      health education programs;

      health care job training programs; and

      the development and expansion of public health-related

 facilities in the Delta Region.

     (b) Project Area. The proposed Project must take place in a Rural

 Area within the Delta Region as defined in this Notice. However, the

 applicant need not propose to serve the entire Delta Region.

     (c) Project Input. Your proposed Project must be developed based on

 input from local governments, public health care providers, and other

 entities in the Delta Region.

     (d) Grant Period. All awards are limited to up to a 24-month grant

 period based upon the complexity of the project. Your proposed grant

 period should begin no earlier than October 1, 2016, and should end no

 later than 24 months following that date. If you receive an award, your

 grant period will be revised to begin on the actual date of award--the

 date the grant agreement is executed by the Agency--and your grant

 period end date will be adjusted accordingly. Your Project activities

 must begin within 90 days of the date of award. If you request funds

 for a time period beginning before October 1, 2016, and/or ending later

 than 24 months from that date, your application will be ineligible. The

 length of your grant period should be based on your Project's

 complexity, as indicated in your application work plan.

     (e) Multiple Grant Requests. The Consortium, including its members,

 is limited to submitting one application for funding under this Notice.

 We will not accept applications from Consortiums that include members

 who are also members of other Consortiums that have submitted

 applications for funding under this Notice. If we discover that a

 Consortium member is a member of multiple Consortiums with applications

 submitted for funding under this Notice, all applications will be

 considered ineligible for funding.

     (f) Performance on Existing DHCS Awards. If the lead entity, or any

 of its Consortium members, has an existing DHCS award, they must be

 performing satisfactorily to be considered eligible for a funding under

 this Notice. Satisfactory performance includes, but is not limited to,

 being up-to-date on all financial and performance reports and being

 current on all tasks as approved in the work plan. The Agency will use

 its discretion to make this determination.

     (g) Completeness. Your application must provide all of the

 information requested in Section D.2. of this Notice. Applications

 lacking sufficient information to determine eligibility and scoring

 will be deemed ineligible and will not be considered for scoring.

     (h) Indirect Costs. Your negotiated indirect cost rate approval

 does not need to be included in your application, but you will be

 required to provide it if a grant is awarded. Approval for indirect

 costs that are requested in an application without an approved indirect

 cost rate agreement is at the discretion of the Agency.

 calculate jobs created, estimates should be based upon actual jobs to

 be created by your organization as a result of the DHCS funding or

 actual jobs to be created by businesses as a result of assistance from

 your organization. When you calculate jobs saved, estimates should be

 based only on actual jobs that would have been lost if your

 organization did not receive DHCS funding or actual jobs that would

 have been lost without assistance from your organization.

     You can also suggest additional performance elements for example

 where job creation or jobs saved may not be a relevant indicator. These

 additional elements should be specific, measurable performance elements

 that could be included in an award document.

 accept applications submitted after the deadline.

     5. Intergovernmental Review.

     Executive Order (EO) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal

 Programs, applies to this program. This EO requires that Federal

 agencies provide opportunities for consultation on proposed assistance

 with State and local governments. Many States have established a Single

 Point of Contact (SPOC) to facilitate this consultation. A list of

 States that maintain a SPOC may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants_spoc. If your State has a SPOC, you may

 submit your application directly for review. Any comments obtained

 through the SPOC must be provided to Rural Development for

 consideration as part of your application. If your State has not

 established a SPOC or you do not want to submit your application to the

 SPOC, Rural Development will submit your application to the SPOC or

 other appropriate agency or agencies.

     You are also encouraged to contact Cooperative Programs at 202-690-

 1374 or cpgrants@wdc.usda.gov if you have questions about this process.

     6. Funding Restrictions.

     The use of project funds, including grant funds and other

 contributions, cannot be used for ineligible purposes. In addition, you

 shall not use project funds for the following:

     (a) To duplicate current services or to replace or to substitute

 support previously provided. However, project funds may be used to

 expand the level of effort or a service beyond what is currently being

 provided;

     (b) To pay for costs to prepare the application for funding under

 this Notice;

     (c) To pay for costs of the project incurred prior to the effective

 date of the period of performance;

     (d) To pay expenses for applicant employee training;

     (e) Fund political activities;

     (f) To pay for assistance to any private business enterprise which

 does not have at least 51 percent ownership by those who are either

 citizens of the United States or reside in the United States after

 being legally admitted for permanent residence;

     (g) To pay any judgment or debt owed to the United States;

     (h) Engage in any activities that are considered a Conflict of

 Interest, as defined by this Notice; or

     (i) Fund any activities prohibited by 2 CFR 200;

     In addition, your application will not be considered for funding if

 it does any of the following:

      Requests more than the maximum grant amount: or



 [[Page 62860]]



      Proposes ineligible costs that equal more than 10 percent

 of the project funds.

     If you include funds in your budget that are for ineligible

 purposes, we will consider the application for funding if the

 ineligible purposes total 10 percent or less of an applicant's project

 funds. However, if the application is successful, those ineligible

 costs must be removed from the work plan and budget and replaced with

 eligible costs before we will make the grant award, or the grant award

 will be reduced accordingly. If we cannot determine the percentage of

 ineligible costs, the application will not be considered for funding.

     7. Other Submission Requirements.

     (a) You should not submit your application in more than one format.

 You must choose whether to submit your application in hard copy or

 electronically. Applications submitted in hard copy should be mailed or

 hand-delivered to the State Office where the project will primarily

 take place. You can find State Office contact information at:
http://www.rd.usda.gov/contact-us/state-offices. To submit an application

 electronically, you must follow the instructions for this funding

 announcement at http://www.grants.gov. A password is not required to

 access the Web site.

     (b) National Environmental Policy Act.

     This Notice has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970,

 ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.'' We have determined that an

 Environmental Impact Statement is not required because the issuance of

 regulations and instructions, as well as amendments to them, describing

 administrative and financial procedures for processing, approving, and

 implementing the Agency's financial programs is categorically excluded

 in the Agency's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation

 found at 7 CFR 1970.53(f), ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.''

 We have determined that this Notice does not constitute a major Federal

 action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

     (c) Civil Rights Compliance Requirements.

     All grants made under this Notice are subject to Title VI of the

 Civil Rights Act of 1964 as required by the USDA (7 CFR part 15,

 subpart A) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title

 VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Title IX, Executive Order 13166

 (Limited English Proficiency), Executive Order 11246, and the Equal

 Credit Opportunity Act of 1974.



 E. Application Review Information



     We will review your application to determine if it is complete and

 eligible. If at any time we determine that your application is

 ineligible, you will be notified in writing as to the reasons it was

 determined ineligible and you will be informed of your review and

 appeal rights.

     We will only score applications in which the lead entity,

 partnering Consortium member entities, and the project are eligible.

 The applications must also be complete and sufficiently responsive to

 program requirements.

     We will review each application to determine if it is eligible for

 funding and complete, based on the requirements of this Notice as well

 as other applicable Federal regulations.

     Applications that are determined to be eligible and complete will

 be evaluated based on the criteria described below.

     1. Criteria.

     For each criterion, you must show how the Project has merit and why

 it is likely to be successful. If you do not address all parts of a

 criterion your application will be deemed ineligible. If you do not

 sufficiently communicate relevant Project information, you will receive

 lower scores. DHCS is a competitive program, so you will receive scores

 based on the quality of your responses. Simply addressing the criteria

 will not guarantee higher scores. Evaluators will base scores only on

 the information provided or cross-referenced by page number in each

 individual evaluation criterion. The maximum number of points that can

 be awarded to your application is 100. The minimum score requirement

 for funding is 60 points. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund

 applications with a score of 59 points or less if it is in the best

 interest of the Federal government.

     The evaluation criteria are detailed in the DHCS Grant Application

 Guide which can be found at http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants. You must address each evaluation

 criterion outlined in this Notice. Any criterion not substantively

 addressed will receive zero points. There are three criteria totaling

 100 points. They are listed below:

     (a) Rurality of the Project and communities served (maximum of 30

 points)--The rurality of the communities served by the Project is an

 objective criterion that measures the rurality of the Project's service

 area. It is determined by the population of the community based upon

 the 2010 U.S. Census data available on the American Fact Finder Web

 site--http://www.factfinder.census.gov. If you have multiple addresses

 in the same community (city, town or census designated place), please

 only list the community once when preparing your rurality calculation.

 The rurality calculation provided in the application will be checked

 and, if necessary, corrected by us.

--------------------------------



     (b) The Community Needs and Benefits derived from the Project

 (maximum of 30 points)--We will assess how the Project will benefit the

 residents in the Delta Region. This criterion will be scored based on

 the documentation in support of the community needs for health services

 and public health-related facilities and the benefits to people living

 in Delta Regional derived from the implementation of the proposed

 Project. It should lead clearly to the identification of the Project

 participant pool and the target population for the Project, and provide

 convincing links between the Project and the benefits to the community

 to address its health needs. RBS will consider:

     (1) The extent of the applicant's documentation explaining the

 health care needs, issues, and challenges facing the service area.

 Include what problems



 [[Page 62861]]



 the residents face and how the Project will benefit the residents in

 the region.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant is able to show the

 relationship between the Project's design, outcome, and benefits.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant explains the Project and its

 implementation and provides milestones which are well-defined and can

 be realistically completed.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant clearly outlines a plan to

 track, report, and evaluate performance outcomes.

     Applicants should attempt to quantify benefits in terms of outcomes

 from the Project; that is, ways in which peoples' lives, or the

 community, will be improved. Provide estimates of the number of people

 affected by the benefits arising from the project.

     (c) The Project Management and Organization Capability (maximum of

 40 points)--We will evaluate the Consortium's experience, past

 performance, and accomplishments addressing health care issues to

 ensure effective Project implementation. This criterion will be scored

 based on the documentation of the Project's management and

 organizational capability. RBS will consider:

     (1) The degree to which the organization has a sound management and

 fiscal structure including: Well-defined roles for administrators,

 staff, and established financial management systems.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant identifies and demonstrates

 that qualifications, capabilities, and educational background of the

 identified key personnel (at a minimum the Project Manager) who will

 manage and implement programs are relevant and will contribute to the

 success of the Project.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates current

 successful and effective experience (or demonstrated experience within

 the past 5 years) addressing the health care issues in the Delta

 Region.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant has experience managing

 grant-funded programs.

     (5) The extent to which the applicant is able to correlate and

 support the budget to the project phases and implementation timeline.

     (6) The extent to which administrative/management costs are

 balanced with funds designated for the provision of programs and

 services.

     (7) The extent and diversity of eligible entity types within the

 applicant's Consortium of regional institutions of higher education,

 academic health and research institutes and economic development

 entities located in the Delta Region.

     2. Review and Selection Process.

     The State Offices will review applications to determine if they are

 eligible for assistance based on requirements in this Notice and other

 applicable Federal regulations. If determined eligible, your

 application will be scored by a panel of National and State Office

 employees in accordance with the point allocation specified in this

 Notice. A recommendation will be submitted to the Administrator to fund

 applications in highest ranking order, subject to availability of

 funds. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund applications with a

 score of 59 points or less if it is in the best interest of the Federal

 government. If your application is evaluated, but not funded, it will

 not be carried forward into the next competition.



 F. Federal Award Administration Information



     1. Federal Award Notices.

     If you are selected for funding, you will receive a signed notice

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



 Overview



     Federal Agency: USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS).

     Funding Opportunity Title: Delta Health Care Services Grant

 Program.

     Announcement Type: Initial funding announcement.

     Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 10.874.

     Dates: You must submit your complete application by November 14,

 2016 or it will not be considered for funding. Electronic copies must

 Executive Order (EO) 13175 Consultation and Coordination With Indian

 Tribal Governments



     This Executive Order imposes requirements on RD in the development

 of regulatory policies that have tribal implications or preempt tribal

 laws. RD has determined that this Notice does not have a substantial

 direct effect on one or more Indian tribe(s) or on either the

 relationship or the distribution of powers and responsibilities between

 the Federal Government and the Indian tribes. Thus, this Notice is not

 subject to the requirements of Executive Order 13175. Tribal

 Consultation inquiries and comments should be directed to RD's Native

 American Coordinator at aian@wdc.usda.gov or (720) 544-2911.



 Paperwork Reduction Act



     The Paperwork Reduction Act requires Federal agencies to seek and

 obtain Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval before

 undertaking a collection of information directed to ten or more

 persons. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44

 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Agency conducted an analysis to determine the

 number of applications the Agency estimates that it will receive under

 the Delta Health Care Services Grant Program. It was determined that

 the estimated number of applications was fewer than nine and in

 accordance with 5 CFR 1320, thus no OMB approval is necessary at this

 time.



 A. Program Description



     This Notice announces the availability of funds for the DHCS grant

 program, which is authorized under Section 379G of the Consolidated

 Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2008u). The primary objective

 of the program is to provide financial assistance to address the

 continued unmet health needs in the Delta Region through cooperation

 among health care professionals, institutions of higher education,

 research institutions, and other individuals and entities in the Delta

 Region. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. The maximum award

 amount per grant is $1,000,000.

 interest for owners, employees, officers, agents, or their immediate

 family members having a financial or other interest in the outcome of

 the project; or that restrict open and free competition for

 unrestrained trade. Specifically, project funds may not be used for

 services or goods going to, or coming from, a person or entity with a

 real or apparent conflict of interest, including, but not limited to,

 owner(s) and their immediate family members. An example of conflict of

 interest occurs when the consortium member's employees, board of

     Economic Development Entity means any public or non-profit

 organization whose primary mission is to stimulate local and regional

 economies within the Delta Region by increasing employment

 opportunities and duration of employment, expanding or retaining

 existing employers, increasing labor rates or wage levels, reducing

 outmigration, and/or creating gains in other economic development-

 related variables such as land values. These activities shall primarily

 benefit low- and moderate-income individuals in the Delta Region.

     Health System means the complete network of agencies, facilities,

 and all providers of health care to meet the health needs of a specific

 geographical area or target populations.

     Institution of Higher Education means either a postsecondary (post-

 high school) educational institution that awards a bachelor's degree or

 provides not less than a 2-year program that is acceptable for full

 credit toward such a degree, or a postsecondary vocational institution

 that provides a program of training to prepare students for gainful

 employment in a recognized occupation.

 Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Public Law 110-246 (June 18,

 2008).

      For the purposes of this definition, cities and towns are

 incorporated population centers with definite boundaries, local self-

 government, and legal powers set forth in a charter granted by the

 State.

     State means each of the 50 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,

 the Virgin Islands of the United States, Guam, American Samoa, the

 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and, as may be determined

 by the Secretary to be feasible, appropriate and lawful, the Federated

 States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the

 C. Eligibility Information



     Applicants must meet all of the following eligibility requirements.

 Your application will not be considered for funding if it does not

 provide sufficient information to determine eligibility or is missing

 required elements. Applicants that fail to submit the required elements

 by the application deadline will be deemed ineligible and will not be

 evaluated further. Information submitted after the application deadline

 will not be accepted.



 1. Eligible Applicants



     Grants funded through DHCS may be made to a Consortium as defined

 in Paragraph A of this Notice. Consortiums are eligible to receive

 funding through this Notice. One member of the Consortium must be

 designated as the lead entity by the other members of the Consortium

 and have legal authority to contract with the Federal government.

     The lead entity is the recipient (see 2 CFR 200.86) of the DHCS

 grant funds and accountable for monitoring and reporting on the project

 performance and financial management of the grant. In addition, the

 lead entity (recipient) is responsible for subrecipient monitoring and

 management in accordance with 2 CFR 200.330 and 200.331, respectively.

 The remaining consortium members are subrecipients (see 2 CFR 200.93).

 They may receive subawards (see 2 CFR 200.94) from the recipient and

 are responsible for monitoring and reporting the project performance

 and financial management of their subaward to the recipient.

     (a) An applicant is ineligible if they do not submit ``Evidence of

 Eligibility'' and ``Consortium Agreements'' as described in Section

 D.2. of this Notice.

     (b) An applicant is ineligible if they have been debarred or

 suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in

 Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment

 and Suspension.'' The Agency will check the System for Award Management

 (SAM) to determine if the applicant has been debarred or suspended. In

 addition, an applicant will be considered ineligible for a grant due to

 an outstanding judgment obtained by the U.S. in a Federal Court (other

 than U.S. Tax Court), is delinquent on the payment of Federal income

 taxes, or is delinquent on Federal debt. The applicant must certify as

 part of the application that they do not have an outstanding judgment

 against them. The Agency will check the Credit Alert Interactive Voice

 Response System (CAIVRS) to verify this.

     (c) Sections 743, 744, 745, and 746 of the Consolidated

 Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113) apply. Any corporation (i)

 that has been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any

 Federal law within the past 24 months or (ii) that has any unpaid

 Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial

 and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and

 that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with

 the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, is not

 eligible for financial assistance provided with funds appropriated by

 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), unless a

 Federal agency has considered suspension or debarment of the

 corporation and has made a determination that this further action is

 not necessary to protect the interests of the Government. In addition,

 none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or

 any other Act may be available for a contract, grant, or cooperative

 agreement with an entity that requires employees or contractors of such

 entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal

 confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise

 restricting such employees or contractors from lawfully



 [[Page 62857]]



 reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or

 law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency

 authorized to receive such information. Additionally, no funds

 appropriated in this or any other Act may be used to implement or

 enforce the agreements in Standard Forms 312 and 4414 of the Government

 or any other nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement if such policy,

 form, or agreement does not contain the following provisions: ``These

 provisions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or

 otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities

 created by existing statute or Executive order relating to (1)

 classified information, (2) communications to Congress, (3) the

 reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law, rule, or

 regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of

 authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or

 safety, or (4) any other whistleblower protection.

     (d) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application

 includes any funding restrictions identified under Section D.6.

     (e) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application is

 not complete in accordance with the requirements stated in Section

 C.3.g.



 2. Cost Sharing or Matching



     Matching funds are not required. However, if you are adding any

 other contributions to the proposed Project, you must provide

 documentation indicating who will be providing the matching funds, the

 amount of funds, when those funds will be provided, and how the funds

 will be used in the project budget. Examples of acceptable

 documentation include: A signed letter from the source of funds stating

 the amount of funds, when the funds will be provided, and what the

 funds can be used for or a signed resolution from your governing board

 authorizing the use of a specified amount of funds for specific

 components of the project. The matching funds you identify must be for

 eligible purposes and included in your work plan and budget.

 Additionally, expected program income may not be used as matching funds

 at the time you submit your application. However, if you have a

 contract to provide services in place at the time you submit your

 application, you can verify the amount of the contract as matching

 funds. If you choose, you may use a template to summarize the matching

 funds. The template is available either from your Rural Development

 State Office or the program Web site at: http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants.



 3. Other Eligibility Requirements



     The following additional eligibility requirements apply to this

 program:

     (a) Use of Funds. An application must propose to use Project funds,

 including grant and other contributions committed under the evaluation

 criteria for eligible purposes. Eligible Project purposes include the

 development of:

      Health care services;

      health education programs;

      health care job training programs; and

      the development and expansion of public health-related

 facilities in the Delta Region.

     (b) Project Area. The proposed Project must take place in a Rural

 Area within the Delta Region as defined in this Notice. However, the

 applicant need not propose to serve the entire Delta Region.

     (c) Project Input. Your proposed Project must be developed based on

 input from local governments, public health care providers, and other

 entities in the Delta Region.

     (d) Grant Period. All awards are limited to up to a 24-month grant

 period based upon the complexity of the project. Your proposed grant

 period should begin no earlier than October 1, 2016, and should end no

 later than 24 months following that date. If you receive an award, your

 grant period will be revised to begin on the actual date of award--the

 date the grant agreement is executed by the Agency--and your grant

 period end date will be adjusted accordingly. Your Project activities

 must begin within 90 days of the date of award. If you request funds

 for a time period beginning before October 1, 2016, and/or ending later

 than 24 months from that date, your application will be ineligible. The

 length of your grant period should be based on your Project's

 complexity, as indicated in your application work plan.

     (e) Multiple Grant Requests. The Consortium, including its members,

 is limited to submitting one application for funding under this Notice.

 We will not accept applications from Consortiums that include members

 who are also members of other Consortiums that have submitted

 applications for funding under this Notice. If we discover that a

 Consortium member is a member of multiple Consortiums with applications

 submitted for funding under this Notice, all applications will be

 considered ineligible for funding.

     (f) Performance on Existing DHCS Awards. If the lead entity, or any

 of its Consortium members, has an existing DHCS award, they must be

 performing satisfactorily to be considered eligible for a funding under

 this Notice. Satisfactory performance includes, but is not limited to,

 being up-to-date on all financial and performance reports and being

 current on all tasks as approved in the work plan. The Agency will use

 its discretion to make this determination.

     (g) Completeness. Your application must provide all of the

 information requested in Section D.2. of this Notice. Applications

 lacking sufficient information to determine eligibility and scoring

 will be deemed ineligible and will not be considered for scoring.

     (h) Indirect Costs. Your negotiated indirect cost rate approval

 does not need to be included in your application, but you will be

 required to provide it if a grant is awarded. Approval for indirect

 costs that are requested in an application without an approved indirect

 cost rate agreement is at the discretion of the Agency.

 signed by an authorized representative of the lead entity and an

 authorized representative of each partnering consortium entity.

     (j) Scoring documentation. You must address and provide

 documentation for each scoring criterion, specifically (1) the rurality

 of the project area and communities served, (2) the community needs and

 benefits derived from the project, and (3) project management and

 organization capability. See Section E.1.

     (k) Work Plan and Budget. You must provide a work plan and budget

 that includes the following: (1) The specific activities, such as

 programs, services, trainings, and/or construction-related activities

 for a facility to be performed under the Project; (2) the estimated

 line item costs associated with each activity, including grant funds

 and other necessary sources of funds; (3) the key personnel who will

 carry out each activity (including each Consortium member's role); and

 (4) the specific time frames for completion of each activity.

     An eligible start and end date for the project and for individual

 project tasks must be clearly shown and may not exceed Agency specified

 timeframes for the grant period. You must show the source and use of

 both grant and other contributions for all tasks. Other contributions

 must be spent at a rate equal to, or in advance of, grant funds.

     (l) Performance Measures. The Agency has also established annual

 performance measures to evaluate the DHCS program. You must provide

 estimates on the following performance measures as part of your

 application:

      Number of businesses assisted;

      Number of jobs created;

      Number of jobs saved;

      Number of individuals assisted/trained.

     It is permissible to have a zero in a performance element. When you

 calculate jobs created, estimates should be based upon actual jobs to

 be created by your organization as a result of the DHCS funding or

 actual jobs to be created by businesses as a result of assistance from

 your organization. When you calculate jobs saved, estimates should be

 based only on actual jobs that would have been lost if your

 organization did not receive DHCS funding or actual jobs that would

 have been lost without assistance from your organization.

     You can also suggest additional performance elements for example

 where job creation or jobs saved may not be a relevant indicator. These

 additional elements should be specific, measurable performance elements

 that could be included in an award document.

     (m) Financial information and sustainability. You must provide

 current financial statements and a narrative description demonstrating

 sustainability of the project, all of which show sufficient resources

 and expertise to undertake and complete the project and how the project

 will be sustained following completion. Applicants must provide 3 years

 of pro-forma financial statements for the project.

 accept applications submitted after the deadline.

     5. Intergovernmental Review.

     Executive Order (EO) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal

 Programs, applies to this program. This EO requires that Federal

 agencies provide opportunities for consultation on proposed assistance

 with State and local governments. Many States have established a Single

 Point of Contact (SPOC) to facilitate this consultation. A list of

 States that maintain a SPOC may be obtained at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
grants_spoc. If your State has a SPOC, you may

 submit your application directly for review. Any comments obtained

 through the SPOC must be provided to Rural Development for

 consideration as part of your application. If your State has not

 established a SPOC or you do not want to submit your application to the

 SPOC, Rural Development will submit your application to the SPOC or

 other appropriate agency or agencies.

     You are also encouraged to contact Cooperative Programs at 202-690-

 1374 or cpgrants@wdc.usda.gov if you have questions about this process.

     6. Funding Restrictions.

     The use of project funds, including grant funds and other

 contributions, cannot be used for ineligible purposes. In addition, you

 shall not use project funds for the following:

     (a) To duplicate current services or to replace or to substitute

 support previously provided. However, project funds may be used to

 expand the level of effort or a service beyond what is currently being

 provided;

     (b) To pay for costs to prepare the application for funding under

 this Notice;

     (c) To pay for costs of the project incurred prior to the effective

 date of the period of performance;

     (d) To pay expenses for applicant employee training;

     (e) Fund political activities;

     (f) To pay for assistance to any private business enterprise which

 does not have at least 51 percent ownership by those who are either

 citizens of the United States or reside in the United States after

 being legally admitted for permanent residence;

     (g) To pay any judgment or debt owed to the United States;

     (h) Engage in any activities that are considered a Conflict of

 Interest, as defined by this Notice; or

     (i) Fund any activities prohibited by 2 CFR 200;

     In addition, your application will not be considered for funding if

 it does any of the following:

      Requests more than the maximum grant amount: or



 [[Page 62860]]



      Proposes ineligible costs that equal more than 10 percent

 of the project funds.

     If you include funds in your budget that are for ineligible

 purposes, we will consider the application for funding if the

 ineligible purposes total 10 percent or less of an applicant's project

 funds. However, if the application is successful, those ineligible

 costs must be removed from the work plan and budget and replaced with

 eligible costs before we will make the grant award, or the grant award

 will be reduced accordingly. If we cannot determine the percentage of

 ineligible costs, the application will not be considered for funding.

     7. Other Submission Requirements.

     (a) You should not submit your application in more than one format.

 You must choose whether to submit your application in hard copy or

 electronically. Applications submitted in hard copy should be mailed or

 take place. You can find State Office contact information at:
http://www.rd.usda.gov/contact-us/state-offices. To submit an application

 electronically, you must follow the instructions for this funding

 announcement at http://www.grants.gov. A password is not required to

 access the Web site.

     (b) National Environmental Policy Act.

     This Notice has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970,

 ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.'' We have determined that an

 Environmental Impact Statement is not required because the issuance of

 regulations and instructions, as well as amendments to them, describing

 administrative and financial procedures for processing, approving, and

 implementing the Agency's financial programs is categorically excluded

 in the Agency's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation

 found at 7 CFR 1970.53(f), ``Environmental Policies and Procedures.''

 We have determined that this Notice does not constitute a major Federal

 action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

     (c) Civil Rights Compliance Requirements.

     All grants made under this Notice are subject to Title VI of the

 Civil Rights Act of 1964 as required by the USDA (7 CFR part 15,

 subpart A) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title

 VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Title IX, Executive Order 13166

 (Limited English Proficiency), Executive Order 11246, and the Equal

 Credit Opportunity Act of 1974.



 E. Application Review Information



     We will review your application to determine if it is complete and

 eligible. If at any time we determine that your application is

 ineligible, you will be notified in writing as to the reasons it was

 determined ineligible and you will be informed of your review and

 appeal rights.

     We will only score applications in which the lead entity,

 partnering Consortium member entities, and the project are eligible.

 The applications must also be complete and sufficiently responsive to

 program requirements.

     We will review each application to determine if it is eligible for

 funding and complete, based on the requirements of this Notice as well

 as other applicable Federal regulations.

     Applications that are determined to be eligible and complete will

 be evaluated based on the criteria described below.

     1. Criteria.

     For each criterion, you must show how the Project has merit and why

 it is likely to be successful. If you do not address all parts of a

 criterion your application will be deemed ineligible. If you do not

 sufficiently communicate relevant Project information, you will receive

 lower scores. DHCS is a competitive program, so you will receive scores

 based on the quality of your responses. Simply addressing the criteria

 will not guarantee higher scores. Evaluators will base scores only on

 the information provided or cross-referenced by page number in each

 individual evaluation criterion. The maximum number of points that can

 be awarded to your application is 100. The minimum score requirement

 for funding is 60 points. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund

 applications with a score of 59 points or less if it is in the best

 interest of the Federal government.

     The evaluation criteria are detailed in the DHCS Grant Application

 Guide which can be found at http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-
services/delta-health-care-services-grants. You must address each evaluation

 criterion outlined in this Notice. Any criterion not substantively

 addressed will receive zero points. There are three criteria totaling

 100 points. They are listed below:

     (a) Rurality of the Project and communities served (maximum of 30

 points)--The rurality of the communities served by the Project is an

 objective criterion that measures the rurality of the Project's service

 area. It is determined by the population of the community based upon

 the 2010 U.S. Census data available on the American Fact Finder Web

 site--http://www.factfinder.census.gov. If you have multiple addresses

 in the same community (city, town or census designated place), please

 only list the community once when preparing your rurality calculation.

 The rurality calculation provided in the application will be checked

 and, if necessary, corrected by us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------



     (b) The Community Needs and Benefits derived from the Project

 (maximum of 30 points)--We will assess how the Project will benefit the

 residents in the Delta Region. This criterion will be scored based on

 the documentation in support of the community needs for health services

 and public health-related facilities and the benefits to people living

 in Delta Regional derived from the implementation of the proposed

 Project. It should lead clearly to the identification of the Project

 participant pool and the target population for the Project, and provide

 convincing links between the Project and the benefits to the community

 to address its health needs. RBS will consider:

     (1) The extent of the applicant's documentation explaining the

 health care needs, issues, and challenges facing the service area.

 Include what problems



 [[Page 62861]]



 the residents face and how the Project will benefit the residents in

 the region.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant is able to show the

 relationship between the Project's design, outcome, and benefits.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant explains the Project and its

 implementation and provides milestones which are well-defined and can

 be realistically completed.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant clearly outlines a plan to

 track, report, and evaluate performance outcomes.

     Applicants should attempt to quantify benefits in terms of outcomes

 from the Project; that is, ways in which peoples' lives, or the

 community, will be improved. Provide estimates of the number of people

 affected by the benefits arising from the project.

     (c) The Project Management and Organization Capability (maximum of

 40 points)--We will evaluate the Consortium's experience, past

 performance, and accomplishments addressing health care issues to

 ensure effective Project implementation. This criterion will be scored

 based on the documentation of the Project's management and

 organizational capability. RBS will consider:

     (1) The degree to which the organization has a sound management and

 fiscal structure including: Well-defined roles for administrators,

 staff, and established financial management systems.

     (2) The extent to which the applicant identifies and demonstrates

 that qualifications, capabilities, and educational background of the

 identified key personnel (at a minimum the Project Manager) who will

 manage and implement programs are relevant and will contribute to the

 success of the Project.

     (3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates current

 successful and effective experience (or demonstrated experience within

 the past 5 years) addressing the health care issues in the Delta

 Region.

     (4) The extent to which the applicant has experience managing

 grant-funded programs.

     (5) The extent to which the applicant is able to correlate and

 support the budget to the project phases and implementation timeline.

     (6) The extent to which administrative/management costs are

 balanced with funds designated for the provision of programs and

 services.

     (7) The extent and diversity of eligible entity types within the

 applicant's Consortium of regional institutions of higher education,

 academic health and research institutes and economic development

 entities located in the Delta Region.

     2. Review and Selection Process.

     The State Offices will review applications to determine if they are

 eligible for assistance based on requirements in this Notice and other

 applicable Federal regulations. If determined eligible, your

 application will be scored by a panel of National and State Office

 employees in accordance with the point allocation specified in this

 Notice. A recommendation will be submitted to the Administrator to fund

 applications in highest ranking order, subject to availability of

 funds. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund applications with a

 score of 59 points or less if it is in the best interest of the Federal

 government. If your application is evaluated, but not funded, it will

 not be carried forward into the next competition.



 F. Federal Award Administration Information



     1. Federal Award Notices.

     If you are selected for funding, you will receive a signed notice

Delta Dental Foundation Provides $30,000 to Carolinas HealthCare Foundation

BYLINE: Delta Dental

LENGTH: 456  words


Charlotte, NC,  August 13, 2016 --(PR.com)-- The Delta Dental Foundation awarded
a $30,000 grant to Carolinas HealthCare Foundation to equip a new maxillofacial
prosthodontics clinic at Carolinas Medical Center, a part of Carolinas
HealthCare System.

The $30,000 grant is the largest the Delta Dental Foundation has awarded to date
in North Carolina.

Almost 50,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with oral cancer -- which
includes head and neck cancers - each year, and it is one of the most expensive
cancers to treat. North Carolina has a particularly high incidence of head and
neck cancer, and many of the patients lose significant portions of their face
and/or jaw as a result. Carolinas Medical Center's maxillofacial prosthodontics
program, the only program of its kind in the region, will provide necessary
facial reconstruction for patients in need.

"Treatment of head and neck cancer patients often includes a combination of
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy that frequently results in functional
limitations in ability to maintain optimal oral health and nutrition," said Dr.
Michael Brennan, Chairman of the Department of Oral Medicine at Carolinas
HealthCare System. "The generous gift from Delta Dental Foundation allowed us to
obtain the necessary equipment to provide full dental services and thus restore
our head and neck cancer patients' ability to have improved oral health and
function."

"The Delta Dental Foundation recognizes the need for state-of-the-art equipment
to support this cutting-edge maxillofacial prosthodontics program," said Curtis
Ladig, President and CEO of Delta Dental of North Carolina. "For patients who
have lost portions of their face and/or jaw as a result of this disease,
treatment is not just a matter of restoring appearance, but also restoring the
ability to speak and eat."

The Delta Dental Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable organization established
in 1980, which serves as the philanthropic arm of Delta Dental of Michigan,
Ohio, Indiana, and North Carolina. The foundation's goals are to support
education and research for the advancement of dental science, and to promote the
oral health of the public through education and service activities, particularly
for those with special needs. For more information, visit www.deltadentalnc.com.

BYLINE: CityBusiness staff reports

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 217  words


Louisiana is receiving a total of $1.8 million in federal grants to reduce
chronic diseases that disproportionately affect residents.

The funds, awarded to Richland Parish and The Health Enrichment Network, will
support collaborative efforts among health care providers to use an
evidence-based model to address diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity,
stroke and behavioral health, according to a news release. Eight states in the
Delta region are receiving a total of $10 million in grant funding in fiscal
year 2016.

The Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program requires that local
health providers work together across counties and parishes to share resources
and expertise, with a focus on strengthening the knowledge of communities about
health risks and disease management.

Funded projects are tailored from programs showing evidence of effectiveness in
addressing gaps and needs in a community setting and improvements in the health
status of individuals. The grants are funded by the Federal Office of Rural
Health Policy at the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program

LENGTH: 620  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Federal Register has issued the following notice:


Action

Notice Of Class Deviation From Competition Requirements For Delta States Rural
Development Network Grant Program.
Summary

The Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP) is announcing supplemental awards to
the current Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program (Delta States)
grantees. The supplemental funds will allow current Delta grantees to implement
outreach and enrollment activities to the rural uninsured in the Mississippi
Delta for the next Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplace open
enrollment period (November 15, 2014--February 15, 2015). In addition, it will
help educate the newly insured about the insurance and benefits they can now
access as a result of enrolling during the initial Health Insurance Marketplace
open enrollment period. The overarching goals of this supplemental funding are
to: (1) increase the number of uninsured educated about their coverage options,
(2) increase the number of uninsured enrolled into the Health Insurance
Marketplaces or other available sources of insurance, such as Medicaid and the
Children's Health Insurance Program, and (3) increase the number of newly
insured individuals educated about the benefits and primary care and
preventative services to which they now have access.

   If you're feeling bad down in the Lower Delta, Delta Regional Medical Center
(DRMC) can help perk you up. The only full service hospital and Level III trauma
center in northwest Mississippi, DRMC also serves as the tri-state Delta's
safety-net hospital. The four medical centers provide heart and vascular care, a
full service emergency room, diagnostics center, outpatient rehab, a sleep
center, a wound healing center, maternal child center, and inpatient psychiatric
care. Delta Medical Group includes about 15 clinics specializing in everything
from gastroenterology to women's health. Founded as the Washington County
General Hospital in 1953, the 358-bed DRMC serves more than 35,000 patients each
year.

   Geographic Reach

   Delta Regional primarily serves those who reside in northwest Mississippi,
but acts as a support hospital for the Delta's tri-state region.

   Financial Performance

   In 2013 Delta Regional reported a 4% decrease in revenue as it saw fewer
patients and those it saw were less likely to pay their bills. Net income
dropped 69% due to the drop in revenue compounded by declines in investment and
grant income and higher interest on its debt.

   Strategy

   Delta Regional is the first hospital in the region to offer patients with
acute kidney injury the CRRT in its intensive care unit. As one of only a few
Mississippi hospitals to offer the therapy, Delta Regional is better able to
improve the healing process for its patients.

   Company Background

   The past decade has been rocky for Delta Regional. Under the direction of CEO
Ray Humphreys, Delta Regional decided to eliminate the closest competition by
acquiring The King's Daughters Hospital for $21 million from Community Health
Systems Inc. in 2005. The move breathed new life into the ailing hospital.

   For years prior to the King's Daughters acquisition Delta Regional's demise
seemed imminent, and the hospital was facing two options: close or be sold.
After some strategic maneuvering by the CEO and a $35 million cash infusion in
2007 in the form of a federal loan, Delta Regional was revived. The hospital
used the cash to pay off debt related to the King's Daughters buy and for
expansion and renovation projects.

LENGTH: 539  words


Bethune-Cookman University opens the Odessa Chambliss Wellness Center -- a
clinic where student nurses will provide health care services to under-served
populations -- on Tuesday with an event targeting violence against women.

Cathy Robinson Pickett, who contracted HIV through a 1984 rape when she was a
college student, will speak about her experiences at 1 p.m. in the School of
Nursing Building at 739 W. International Speedway Blvd., Daytona Beach.

The university is one of three historically black colleges to receive a federal
grant to develop a yearlong series of programs aimed at increasing awareness and
ending violence against women.

The wellness center -- named for a nurse who was the mother of university
graduate and donor Lucille O'Neal -- will serve several purposes, according to a
university news release. They include:*educating health care
professionals.*providing an entry point to the health care system for minorities
who "may be otherwise isolated from resources because of illiteracy, language
and cultural barriers."*coordinating preventive services and providing
programming to target infant mortality, homeless children and immunizations.

Her talk starts at 7 p.m. in the Instructional Media Center of the duPont-Ball
Library, 134 E. Minnesota Ave.. DeLand.

Strier, a professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, wrote a book
on her efforts to save the monkeys, whose population in 1987 had dwindled to
about 500. That number has since doubled, according to Stetson English professor
Mary Pollock.

AVIATORS TO SPEAK

Two retired black Air Force pioneers will speak in separate events in the area
this week.

Ret. Lt. Col. Hiram Mann of Titusville will discuss the experiences of the
Tuskegee Airmen during World War II at Stetson from 6 to 8:30 p.m. Thursday in
Room 108 of the Lynn Business Center, 345 N. Woodland Blvd, DeLand.

Mann's life is profiled in "Tuskegee Airman Fighter Pilot," a book written by
Patrick Coggins, Jesse Ball duPont professor of education at Stetson.

Then on Friday, Ret. Col. Walter Watson, the only black pilot to fly the
top-secret SR 71 spy plane, will speak at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

Watson, one of just 96 people to have flown the supersonic jet that set altitude
and speed records in the 1970s, plans to talk at 2 p.m. in the atrium of the
College of Aviation Building at the Daytona Beach campus, 600 S. Clyde Morris
Blvd.

He will also speak to more than 300 sixth-graders at Campbell Middle School that
morning.-- Compiled by Education Writer Mark Harper

Delta Health Alliance lands two grants to expand its programs in Mississippi
Delta

The Delta Health Alliance recently received two federal grants to expand its
programs in the Mississippi Delta. One grant was awarded by the U.S. Department
of Human Services for $313,329. The other grant was awarded by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture for $186,200.

Both grants will be used for the Delta Health Alliance to bring mental health
services to medically underserved areas in the Delta.

Partners with the Delta Health Alliance in these grant programs include
community mental health centers in Greenwood and Clarksdale, their satellite
sites in Charleston, Indianola and Belzoni, the Mississippi State Hospital in
Whitfield and the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson.

Dr. Karen Fox, president and CEO of the Delta Health Alliance, said, "Because
the Delta is so short on medical specialists and because few residents can
travel to Jackson or Memphis to receive care, we are bringing those doctors to
the Delta, via computer and interactive video connections. "

The program began one year ago and allows a patient to come to a community
health center in Greenwood or Clarksdale, and talk "live" with a psychiatrist.

The Delta Health Alliance is a nonprofit organization that supports
community-based healthcare initiatives that target critical health and wellness
issues in the Mississippi Delta. Located in Stoneville, the Delta Health
Alliance currently funds 35 community-based programs that are spread throughout
the Delta region.

MSU dental programs gets $250,000

BYLINE: Tim Krohn, The Free Press, Mankato, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 559 words


Dec. 14--MANKATO -- There were lots of smiles in the Minnesota State University
dental health clinic Wednesday.

Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation granted the university $250,000 to purchase
dental exam chairs and other equipment for the oral health clinic in the
university's new Clinical Sciences building.

"We're just grinning from ear to ear. There were so many things we've had on our
wish list we wanted to buy for our students but couldn't," said Lisa Fleck,
chair of the dental hygiene department.

"We can get some new sterilization equipment and other equipment for patient
treatment," Fleck said.

The program has 40 students and part of their degree is to provide oral health
services to patients. The clinic at MSU serves 3,500 patients from the community
each year, providing screenings, cleanings, X-rays and restorative care.

Fleck said many who use the services don't have dental insurance but others do.
The clinic has a reduced fee system.

"People who come are really impressed with the thoroughness of care," Fleck
said.

She said an appointment takes a bit longer than a traditional one because the
students' work is always checked by instructors along the way.

The equipment will be installed and ready for use at the beginning of the spring
semester on Jan. 9.

A ribbon cutting for the new building, located along Warren Street across from
the Taylor Center, is scheduled for Jan. 19.

Fleck said the new building is a massive upgrade for the dental program and
clinic, a program she admits even some faculty members on campus aren't aware
exists. For 44 years the program has been out of sight, housed in the basement
of Morris Hall.

"Now we'll be on the first floor. There's double the space. We have windows!
It's awesome," Fleck said.

Besides the MSU oral hygiene students, students from South Central College's
dental assisting program also make use of the MSU program and facility.

President Richard Davenport said in a written statement that the grant is a big
boost for the program. "This grant allowed us to appropriately equip the space,
which will benefit those receiving dental care while also providing real-world,
practical training opportunities for our students."

Delta Dental Foundation Director Joe Lally said programs like MSU's not only
train people but help community members who don't have access to affordable
dental care. "We are so happy to invest in this clinic, which will not only
provide care to underserved Minnesotans, but help educate the next generation of
oral health care professionals," Lally said in a statement.

In 2009, Delta Dental of Minnesota's parent sold a company and used 100 percent
of the proceeds to establish and fund Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation.
Since then, the foundation has worked to expand access to dental care for
Minnesota's underserved populations by primarily investing in programs and
organizations that provide dental care to people in need.

Since 2011, Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation has invested more than $21
million in grants to nearly 70 programs and organizations that promote oral
health. It is the largest endowed foundation in Minnesota with a mission to
support oral health.

Records: Stoneville-based Delta Health Alliance paid Delta Council $1M for
'administrative' services

BYLINE: Clay Chandler

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 620  words


The Delta Health Alliance has paid an average of $272,000 the past four years
for an administrative contract with the Delta Council.

Those figures are spelled out in DHA tax returns.

In 2008, DHA paid Delta Council $293,630 for administrative services. In 2009
and 2010, that number dropped to $275,000. For the fiscal year that ended June
30,2011, DHA paid Delta Council $246,125.

In a phone interview in late November, Delta Council executive vice president
Chip Morgan told the Mississippi Business Journal the economic development
organization provided back-office services for the nonprofit DHA, which provides
healthcare for the poor in the Delta.

Roy Campbell III, a Jackson attorney who represents DHA, said in an email that
Delta Council has provided accounting and management services that "have
included general bookkeeping and accounting services, payroll and check writing
services, internal auditing and procurement services, logistics and
administrative support for meetings and events, and community liaison work."

The CEO of DHA, Dr. Karen Fox, is under investigation by Mississippi's Northern
District U.S. Attorney for possible misuse of agency funds. It's unknown if
DHA's contract with Delta Council is a part of that investigation. Her attorney
has said he's confident Fox will be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Although DHA's website lists Morgan as an active board member, Campbell said
Morgan has not served on the board since 2007, when DHA first issued a request
for proposals for accounting and management consulting services.

Of the three responses to the RFP, Campbell said, Delta Council's was the
lowest, coming in at roughly $275,000 annually. The other two, from companies
Campbell did not name, were $500,000 and $552,000 annually. Campbell said DHA's
contract with Delta Council is for five years.

Morgan did not respond to calls and text messages to his cell phone last week.

Since 2006, most of DHA's funding has come via a competitive grant process
administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Campbell said
DHA does not receive its funding through direct appropriations, and the agency
has not paid anyone to lobby for funding on its behalf.

In 2006, an appropriation bill for HRSA included $25 million for DHA. A
continuing resolution in 2007 stripped funding for the agency. Funding was
restored via a provision in the 2008 farm bill that created a USDA Health Care
Services competitive grant program that authorized an annual appropriation of $3
million from 2008 to 2012. DHA has successfully competed for some of that
funding, which was open to counties in the Mississippi River Delta, according to
a spokesperson for Sen. Thad Cochran.

Also in 2008, Cochran was instrumental in securing a $25 million earmark from
HRSA for DHA, in the form of a grant. In 2009, Cochran used the same method to
secure $26 million for DHA; in 2010, he secured $35 million.

The money dried up in 2011 and 2012, as part of a moratorium enacted after the
2010 midterm elections, when Republicans whose platform included eliminating
earmarks won a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Cochran spokesperson Chris Gallegos said records that charted who Cochran met
with, or who may have lobbied for DHA's funding, were not available.

"Over the years, the Cochran office has worked with a number of officials
associated with the Delta Health Initiative, just as the senator's office works
with other constituents and groups from Mississippi," Gallegos wrote in an
email. "The exact dates, times and attendees of such meetings over the past six
years are not available. Sen. Cochran is, of course, supportive of thorough
oversight and accountability for the proper use of all federal funds."

2015 - Sustaining Delta Beyond Oil Is My Priority - - Olejeme [interview]

BYLINE: Charles Kumolu

LENGTH: 877 words


Chairperson Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund, NSITF, and governorship
aspirant in Delta State, in a chat with Vanguard acticulates why she wants to
govern Delta and her vision for the state.

My vision is inspired by the passion to serve and uplift the people of Delta
State to greater height. It is a clear goal that seeks to harness the huge
potentials and capabilities in human and material resources available in the
state and ensure all inclusive development, job creation, poverty reduction and
to re-orientate the mind-set of our people, creating conducive environment for
industry and commerce to thrive, huge investment in agriculture, education,
health and creating opportunity for the youths and ensure a decent and quality
life for all.

Our actions will be guided by total commitment to the will of God and service to
our people. The pursuit of this goal requires clear strategy and vision, and we
are certain that we have the requisite experience, zeal and commitment to
actualize these set objectives. We understand the magnitude of the work to be
done and are sufficiently equipped to take Delta to the next level. A lot of
grounds need to be covered, we need to catch up and excel in a very short time.

We recognise government as a continuum and therefore intend to consolidate on
the efforts of the previous and present administrations in the state. I have
offered myself for service and will provide the model of governance that will be
people centred.

If elected to serve, our government shall be a government of equal opportunity
for all Delta citizens. Our programmes and policies will be people-centered and
will be anchored on the concept of mass participation, accountability, community
development and values built on hard work, integrity and private enterprise,
setting the bench mark for transparency and accountability in governance.

We shall promote effective grassroots administration at local government level
and ensure that government presence is felt in every community. A new framework
for Local government partnership in service delivery shall be evolved where
every town union will be required to prepare annual budgets and government will
provide matching grants to fund part of the town's budget to execute major
developmental projects/social services and ensure security.

We shall encourage the participation of traditional rulers in governance by
constituting Traditional Rulers Advisory Council whose duty shall be to advise
government on matters bordering on community security, development and culture.

Delta beyond oil is a programme that must of necessity be encouraged and
sustained for the good of our state. One way to do this is to embark on large
scale agricultural farms to employ thousands of workers directly and create
thousands of jobs indirectly. This will be achieved by training and facilitating
youths Agricultural Entrepreneurial Model, which will encourage the youths to
invest in agriculture as a business.

We shall also provide agricultural credit support schemes to farmers as well as
provide agricultural credit, farm tools, fertilizers and improved seedlings. We
shall also empower our farmers' cooperative societies through facilitation of
sustainable food production and processing, support for strategic food
preservation and farm settlement development. Under our Agricultural Master
Plan, we will divide our state into three agricultural zones each producing
products it has comparative advantage. We will as a matter of fact invest in
aquaculture because we are upbeat on making Delta State the highest fish
producing state in the country.

Education is very strategic to the overall development of any state, and
building sustainable education requires aggressive investment. We will establish
model schools in all local government councils; refurbish primary schools;
rehabilitate and maintain existing schools and libraries; provide school
furniture/equipment, teaching materials, curriculum review/entrepreneurial and
vocational training, functional scholarship system; and enhanced tertiary
education.

We will improve the welfare of our teachers by providing incentives and training
to encourage productivity while setting performance assessment method to
entrench effective service delivery.

We will pursue a public healthcare system that will cater for the health needs
of every Delta State indigene. This will be achieved by widening access,
equipping and training healthcare providers in our primary health care
facilities in every community in the state.

We will also embark on expansion of primary health-care programmes; improvement
of secondary health-care; strengthening of the marine ambulance and emergency
medical services; and improvement of medical personnel welfare. We will
introduce comprehensive health insurance cover for every Deltan.

This will be achieved by the introduction of community based health insurance
that will cater for the healthcare need of the rural poor. We will build and
equip at least two international hospitals in partnership with the private
sector, which will be centres of excellence in medicine.

To ensure that we promote medical tourism, we will strengthen our healthcare
system by ensuring enforcement of health care delivery standards at all times.

Operator of high school clinics in Stockton, Calif., makes cuts

BYLINE: By Joe Goldeen

LENGTH: 254 words



STOCKTON, Calif. -- Higher costs of doing business, coupled with cuts in federal
funding, forced Delta Health Care to cut some administrative and clinic staff
positions. However, no client services will be affected.

Delta Health Care operates full-service primary-care clinics at Edison and Stagg
high schools in Stockton; a program for women, infants and children serving
10,000 clients a month; reproductive-health clinics in Stockton and Lodi; and
outreach and education programs primarily focusing on teens and adolescents.

The private, nonprofit agency, which operates on donations, grants, state and
federal funding as well as fees for services, announced about two weeks ago that
it would cut three administrative positions and 1.5 clinic positions, as well as
reduce some hours.

"We tried to make cuts so we would not affect services," said development
director Robin Knowlton, who is among those being let go effective next
Wednesday. "We want to preserve our ability to serve clients. It's no surprise
for a lot of nonprofits."

The 80 employees remaining also will have their salaries reduced for the next
three months, Knowlton said.

management arm, State Street Global Advisors.

A spokeswoman for State Street told the Boston Business Journal that Nigel
Wightman, SSgA's managing director in London, left the company for personal
reasons. His departure follows the resignation last week of chief investment
officer Alan Brown. He also works in London and had been passed over for SSgA's
top post earlier this year. Air fares raised to cover fuel costs A day after
retreating on fare hikes, most major U.S. airlines yesterday revived increases
of $10 per round trip on many domestic flights to cover the rising cost of jet
fuel. Delta Air Lines, which broke with the price increase on Monday,
reconsidered overnight and pushed fares higher yesterday morning. Delta's move
was soon copied by Continental Airlines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines
and US Airways. Patriot Ledger Staff and News Services

Donation helps Arkansas communities comply with fluoridation law

LENGTH: 516  words

DATELINE: Chicago


American Dental Associations has issued the following news release:

When the Arkansas General Assembly passed a fluoridation law in 2011, 34 water
systems statewide faced startup costs to comply with the law. Thanks to a
donation from Delta Dental of Arkansas Foundation, about one-third of the water
systems affected have completed the implementation process and all 34 should be
fluoridating by sometime in 2016.

"It was a tremendous accomplishment getting the law passed," said Billy Tarpley,
executive director of the Arkansas State Dental Association. "It was a huge,
broad-based endeavor by the state's dentists and other health care providers,
the ASDA and ADA, the state department of health, an oral health coalition,
other concerned groups and Delta. We couldn't have gotten it passed without
Delta's contribution, which kept the law from being an unfunded mandate."

The law calls for water systems that serve 5,000 or more customers to fluoridate
without using taxpayer dollars for startup costs. Initial startup cost estimates
came in around $500,000, which Delta's foundation readily agreed to cover, said
Melissa Masingill, vice president of public affairs for Delta Dental of
Arkansas. But when water systems began to submit their grant applications to
cover startup costs, it became clear that the bottom line cost would be in the
neighborhood of $7-8 million.

"Delta is still committed to paying the start-up costs for the affected water
systems," said Ms. Masingill. "Our mission is to improve the oral health of
Arkansans, and we know that providing access to fluoridated water is one of the
most cost-effective ways to fulfill that mission."

Ms. Masingill said that the water systems are submitting their grant
applications on a rolling basis, so that all 34 startups are staggered over time
and the process from grant approval to implementation of fluoridated water takes
between six and 18 months, depending on the water system.

The collaborative effort to pass the legislation, she added, included educating
legislators on the importance and effectiveness of fluoridation and showing them
data that showed that two-thirds of Arkansans supported it. When all of the
water systems are online, some 700,000 additional residents will be receiving
the benefits of optimal water fluoridation.

"We are happy to support the hard work and dedication of Arkansas dentists and
everyone else who worked together to make it happen. Our foundation just adopted
a long-term, strategic goal for children in Arkansas to be cavity free by 2025,
and fluoridation will be a big part of this effort, especially for children in
underserved areas," said Ms. Masingill.

"We really appreciate Delta's contribution to this effort," Mr. Tarpley said. "
Delta played a critical role in getting the legislation passed and supporting
the work of our dentists and the coalition. Even though the cost was much higher
than originally projected, they stepped up to make this accomplishment a
reality."

Indian gaming committee distributes $268K in grants

BYLINE: Denise Madrid, The Porterville Recorder, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 489 words


April 06--A committee of city, county and Tule River tribal representatives
awarded nearly $268,000 in grants Thursday to local public agencies impacted by
tribal gaming.

Of that sum, Porterville is expected to receive $104,000 to support the city's
police and fire departments and Sierra View Healthcare District $30,000 to
expand its diabetes education and prevention program.

The Tulare County Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee, charged with
selecting the grant recipients, met in the council chambers at City Hall to
consider applications submitted by the city of Porterville, Tulare County Fire
Department, Tulare County Resource Management Agency, Kaweah Delta Healthcare
District and Sierra View Healthcare District, all vying for a share of the
money.

Senate Bill 621, which was passed in 2004, makes the funding available from the
Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Gaming tribes that operated 200 or more
gaming devices on or before September 1999 contribute a variable portion of
their net winnings into the fund.

In Tulare County, the Tule River Tribe contributes winnings, and must sponsor
the grants and find that the proposed grant projects have a reasonable
relationship to the impacts associated with Eagle Mountain Casino.

On Thursday, the committee evaluated the proposals and weighed their merits
based on state guidelines. The guidelines give priority to law enforcement, fire
services, emergency medical services, roads, public health, recreation and youth
programs, waste disposal and water supplies, child care programs, mitigating
environmental impacts and behavioral health.

Allison Pierce, Tulare County staff representative, said that based on a portion
of state guidelines, the city of Porterville, Sierra View and the Tulare County
Fire Department's proposals were not recommended for funding.

Deputy County Counsel Nina Dong said that all applicants should have specified
what percentage or overall need was attributable to the impacts of the casino.

The committee chose to discard that portion of the guidelines. Committee member
and Porterville City Councilman Cameron Hamilton said it was "the most
ridiculous restriction I've ever heard of."

Following is a list of the remaining grant recipients:

-- Tulare County RMA, $64,000 to improve two miles of Mountain Road 137
(Reservation Road)

-- Tulare County Fire Department, $40,000 to purchase emergency radio pagers and
fire shelters

-- Kaweah Delta Healthcare District, $30,000 to go toward the construction of an
elevated heli-pad next to the Visalia hospital's emergency room

It is anticipated the the State Controller's Office will allocate the money to
grant recepients by June 30.

CalPERS balking at stock options

SACRAMENTO - Calling a $2.4 billion stock option package ``intolerable,'' the
California Public Employees' Retirement System on Tuesday urged Minnesota-based
UnitedHealth Group Inc. to revamp its executive pay practices.

CalPERS wants UnitedHealth officials to address concerns over the stock options,
including a $1.6 billion grant to Chief Executive William McGuire, and an
apparent two-tier retirement package for McGuire. CalPERS wants to meet with
UnitedHealth officials before the company's annual meeting Tuesday.

``The (health care) prices for all our members are going through the roof,''
said Rob Feckner, board president of CalPERS, a $207 billion fund and the
nation's third-largest purchaser of health care. ``People on the bottom end are
paying for those salaries.''

UnitedHealth officials said they would huddle with CalPERS to explain the stock
option program. The company pointed out that the value of McGuire's options
reflects the ``company's extraordinary growth over the past 15 years.''

Chevron battens down for storms

HOUSTON - Chevron Corp. has increased preparations at its Gulf Coast oil
refineries and production facilities as the hurricane season approaches, the
company's CEO said Wednesday at the annual stockholders meeting.

Chevron, the country's second-largest petroleum producer, has backup computer
systems, some spare inland offices and procedures for evacuating 2,500 employees
who work on offshore platforms and drilling rigs.

``We have beefed up our plans,'' chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly said. ``I think
we're about as ready as we can be.''

He said Chevron is still producing about 100,000 barrels a day less than it had
been - down about one-third of its oil and gas production in the Gulf, a
fraction of Chevron's worldwide production.

Its Pascagoula, Miss., refinery was shut down for six weeks after Hurricane
Katrina last year, and many small, unmanned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were
destroyed. A larger platform about 165 miles southwest of New Orleans was lost
in Hurricane Rita.

Microsoft in talks to buy Massive

SAN JOSE - Microsoft Corp. is in talks to acquire Massive Inc., a company that
inserts advertising into video games, according to people familiar with the
deal.

The deal could boost Microsoft's efforts to get into the business of selling
advertising, a key part of its bid to better compete with online giants such as
Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc.

Delta, Aeromexico partners for work

ATLANTA - Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico are forming a maintenance partnership
in which they will work on each other's planes and also sell services to other
carriers, the companies announced Wednesday.

The Mexican airline - already a marketing partner of Delta's in the SkyTeam
alliance - will do heavy maintenance work on Delta's fleet of MD-88s under the
agreement.

The first Delta MD-88 goes to Guadalajara in July.

Delta, in turn, will maintain certain jet engines and auxiliary power units for
Aeromexico.

Inaugural J-PAL Health Care Delivery Innovation Competition winners announced

LENGTH: 1131  words

DATELINE: New York



 Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology has issued the following news
release:



 The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) North America, a research
center at MIT announced today the winners of its inaugural Health Care Delivery
Innovation Competition. The competition supports the development of large-scale
randomized controlled trials of innovative programs with the potential to serve
as models for improving health care for vulnerable populations.





 The four winning organizations are CareOregon, a nonprofit health plan serving
a large Medicaid population in Oregon; the Commonwealth Care Alliance, a
Massachusetts care delivery system for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries with
complex medical needs; the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections, which
administers correctional facilities in Louisville, Kentucky; and the Northeast
Delta Human Services Authority, a quasi-governmental behavioral health care
safety net provider in northeastern Louisiana.



 "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with these four innovative
organizations to generate evidence with the potential to inform the practice of
health care across the United States," said Amy Finkelstein, the John and Jennie
S. MacDonald Professor of Economics at MIT and co-scientific director of J-PAL
North America.



 J-PAL North America will work with the winning organizations to develop
rigorous evidence on pressing issues in health care delivery and public health:
addressing the opioid epidemic, improving social determinants of health,
integrating primary and behavioral health care, and engaging high-cost,
high-need patients.



 "Improving the care we deliver to vulnerable populations is critical to the
viability of our health care system. Generating rigorous evidence of innovative
programs is a key step in realizing this financial and moral imperative," said
Quentin Palfrey, executive director of J-PAL North America.



 CareOregon was selected based on its holistic care model, which coordinates
health care with social services including housing, nutrition, and social
supports. The program leverages a network of service providers outside of the
traditional boundaries of the health care system to improve the health of
Medicaid patients.



 "It's wonderful to be able to partner with J-PAL on this important work," said
Eric Hunter, CareOregon's chief executive officer. "One thing that we have
recognized about health is that so many factors are entirely outside of the
arena of what we traditionally consider 'health care.' Our Community Health
Innovation programs address social determinants of health, such as food,
housing, and social isolation. The grant from J-PAL will provide us the
technical assistance to analyze and evaluate the results of these efforts.
Ultimately, we'll learn how to better align social determinant goals with
clinical criteria to improve our members' health outcomes and overall well-being
as well as be able to share those best practices with others."



 Commonwealth Care Alliance is deploying financial incentives to engage some of
its highest-need, but most difficult-to-reach patients. Commonwealth Care
Alliance will collaborate with J-PAL North America to study whether these
incentives can increase patient engagement in the initial steps of the care
process, and subsequently improve downstream health and reduce health care
spending.



 "We are excited to be recognized by, and eager to start working with J-PAL.
Commonwealth Care Alliance and J-PAL share a common goal to work together to
support and implement innovative healthcare strategies," said Christopher D.
Palmieri, president and CEO of Commonwealth Care Alliance. "This grant will help
support CCA's commitment to lead transformation and innovation, on a larger
level."



 The Louisville Metro Department of Corrections is designing a pay-for-success
initiative to provide treatment to individuals with substance abuse disorders
discharged from Louisville, Kentucky jails. Louisville will leverage competition
resources to evaluate whether providing these services can improve health
outcomes and reduce recidivism.



 "Louisville Metro Government appreciates being selected as an award recipient
and looks forward to working with J-PAL to improve delivery of care and
treatment to individual suffering the effects of substance abuse and addiction,"
said Mark Bolton, director of the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections.



 The Northeast Delta Human Services Authority has developed an innovative
integrated services network to provide integrated primary care and a range of
social services, including housing, employment, and transportation, to rural and
low-income populations with behavioral health needs.



 "We want to thank J-PAL for this prestigious award and for the opportunity to
work with their renowned research team as we continue to perfect our integrated
service model," said Monteic A. Sizer, executive director of the Northeast Delta
Human Services Authority. "Empirical test findings around our innovative service
delivery model could change the way primary and behavioral health care is
delivered for vulnerable populations with complex needs in Louisiana and across
the country. Being selected for this award is a testament to our board and
staff's commitment to our vision and mission. We look forward to sharing and
implementing discoveries with our state's health care, business, community, and
elected officials."



 The Innovation Competition is a part of J-PAL's U.S. Health Care Delivery
Initiative, which is currently also supporting randomized evaluations of the
Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers' pioneering care coordination program
for high-cost, high-need patients, the Nurse-Family Partnership flagship
nurse-home visiting program for low-income, first-time mothers, and a number of
other programs across the country. The initiative was established with generous
support from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation.



 J-PAL North America is a regional office of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty
Action Lab. J-PAL was established in 2003 as a research center at MIT's
Department of Economics. Since then, it has built a global network of affiliated
professors based at over 40 universities and regional offices in Africa, Europe,
Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.
J-PAL North America was established with support from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and works to improve the
effectiveness of social programs in the region through three core activities:
research, policy outreach, and capacity building.

Financial relationship between University of Mississippi Medical Center, Delta
Health Alliance remains in place

BYLINE: Clay Chandler

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 751  words


Mentioned throughout the court file of James Hahn's wrongful termination lawsuit
against the Delta Health Alliance is a possible grant from DHA to University of
Mississippi Medical Center to help the hospital pay for implementing electronic
health records.

The hospital's move toward EHRs is part of the mandates spelled out in the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A hospital spokesman told the
Mississippi Business Journal in early November that the process would cost $70
million over the next five years.

In a motion for summary judgment, DHA attorneys asked Lafayette County Circuit
Judge John Gregory to bar Hahn's attorney, Jim Waide, from seeking information
about DHA possibly awarding a multi-million dollar grant to UMMC to implement
EHRs, contingent upon the hospital using Chicago-based Allscripts as its
software provider. In 2008, according to court filings, DHA paid Allscripts
$1.775 million. DHA attorneys argued Waide's seeking information about the grant
during discovery was improper, because Hahn had not mentioned the claims in his
original complaint.

Hahn, who was DHA's senior vice president of programs before his May 2010
termination, said in his initial complaint that DHA CEO Dr. Karen Fox had
improperly spent agency money for personal expenses, including a condo in
Oxford, babysitting services and to pay an attorney for a private legal matter.
The nonprofit's board of directors approved each of the expenses, in a
resolution adopted about three months after Hahn filed suit. The case settled
last May, with the terms under seal. Fox, who remains DHA's CEO, is now under
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of
Mississippi. Her attorney told the MBJ in late November he's confident she will
be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Jack Mazurak, spokesperson for UMMC, wrote in an email to the MBJ that between
July 2006 and June 2009, the hospital received a grant from the federal Health
Resources and Services Administration that was administered through DHA via a
sub-agreement between the hospital and the nonprofit.

Under the agreement, the hospital was awarded a budget of $3.5 million to
implement EHRs. The grant was on a reimbursement basis; and between fiscal year
2007 and FY 2009, Mazurak wrote, the hospital invoiced DHA for $3.2 million for
the project. Roy Campbell III, a Jackson attorney who represents DHA, said in an
email to the MBJ that the total budgeted amount for the project was $6.7
million. Mazurak and Campbell each said the sub-grant remains active.

In a phone interview, Mazurak said when the grant was first awarded, Allscripts
was one of the vendors selected after a Request for Proposals to implement EHRs
at some of UMMC's outpatient facilities that serve the Delta. One of the
modifications made to the grant's terms was the selection of a new vendor whose
technology would allow connectivity between EHRs at the hospital's outpatient
facilities and those at the primary inpatient hospital in Jackson.

"The original grant was not specific to Allscripts," Mazurak said, when he was
asked if the grant was contingent upon the hospital using the Chicago company.
The only conditions attached to the grant, Mazurak added, were accountability
and oversight provisions that normally accompany federal grants. Mazurak added
that the investigation of Fox has not altered the hospital's relationship with
DHA.

Mazurak said the hospital and the nonprofit have several other joint ventures,
including an asthmatic center in Greenville, a mental healthcare services and
educational programs for junior high school students.

Campbell wrote in his email that the two entities "continue to work together
collaboratively on EHRs to increase the access of healthcare and to improve the
quality of healthcare to patients in the Mississippi Delta."

THE ACCUSATIONS

In July 2010, James Hahn sued DHA in Lafayette County Circuit Court, alleging
that he was fired for reporting that Fox had inappropriately spent DHA money,
including some for personal expenses. Among the claims in Hahn's complaint were
that Fox used DHA funds (which come mostly from federal sources) to:

* Pay for an attorney in a private legal matter

* Lease a condominium in Oxford

* Pay for childcare

* Pay her interior decorator

Telluride Foundation Recipient of School-Based Oral Health Innovation Award

BYLINE: San Miguel Basin Forum staff

LENGTH: 695  words


In January 2008, the Telluride Foundation's Local Health Initiative, launched a
school-based cavity prevention program.

The San Juan Kids Cavity Prevention Program, nicknamed Skippy, is a partnership
with the Montrose Community Dental Clinic and the Forsyth Institute in Boston.
Recently, Skippy received state wide recognition for Innovation in Children's
Oral Health Care from the Colorado Association of School-Based Health Care.
Skippy was selected among forty seven school-based health care centers in the
State of Colorado at the Association's annual meeting in Denver last week.

"We are so proud of the Colorado Association of School-Based Health Care award
and the great service the Skippy program is providing to our regions kids," said
Gary Steinbach, Skippy Administrator. "In our region, many kids lack a dental
home or regular oral health services. The award recognizes Skippy's success in
achieving strong school support and participation, the clinical outcome results
and study and our health insurance enrollment program."

According to Gary Steinbach, Skippy's wide acceptance by twelve participating
elementary schools in Naturita, Paradox, Norwood, Telluride, Ridgway, Ouray,
Montrose, Olathe and Delta is credited to the success of the program. Since
2008, Skippy has provided two cavity prevention treatments each school-year to
over 950 children each school-year.

Skippy participates in a clinical outcome study which is conducted each year by
the Forsyth Institute, Boston. According to Richard Neiderman, DMD, Director of
Evidence Based Dentistry, children participating in three or - more Skippy
treatments experience the following oral health outcomes: First, the percentage
of children experiencing pain, abscesses or swelling, was reduced from 15% of
children on the first visit to only 3% by the third visit. Second, the
percentage of teeth with untreated decay was reduced from 3.2 percent to near
zero or 0.6 percent.

According to the Colorado Association of School-Based Health Care, Skippy is the
only school-based oral health program in Colorado that participates in an
ongoing clinical outcome study conducted by an independent clinical research
organization.

Skippy also provides a health insurance enrollment program. "Our program
identifies children who do not have health insurance and coordinates health
insurance enrollment services for eligible children and their families in
Medicaid and CHP+," said Steinbach. "Since 2008 Skippy has identified over 400
uninsured children without health insurance and has enrolled 220 eligible
children and their family members."

Funding has been provided by the Telluride Foundation, the Caring for Colorado
and El Pomar Foundations and private donors. The program is free for all local
children and is offered in elementary schools in Ouray, Montrose,

San Miguel and Delta counties. Since the program's inception, 2,511 treatments
have been delivered to nearly 1,000 children ages 5-12 at twelve participating
elementary schools.

The Local Healthcare Initiative was established by the Telluride Foundation in
2006 to identify and strategically act on health care service gaps and leverage
resources and programs among providers and clinics. Its mission is to improve
the health of children and adults in San Miguel, Ouray and west Montrose
counties by collaborating with local health care providers to identify and
prioritize local health needs and by developing, funding, and implementing
preventive health programs.

The Telluride Foundation exists to create a stronger Telluride community through
the promotion and support of philanthropy. It is a non-profit, apolitical
community foundation that provides year-round support for local organizations
involved in arts, education, athletics, charitable causes, land conservation and
other community-based efforts through technical assistance, education and grant
making.

As a grant maker, The Foundation awards grants to qualified applicants that
serve the people living and working in the Telluride area for the purpose of
enhancing the quality of life within the region. For more information on the
Telluride Foundation, visit www.telluridefoundation .org.

THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AROUND THE SOUTHSIDE 'Delta House' is Clayton's 12th
Habitat residence

BYLINE: By E. Richard Walton

LENGTH: 338 words


Clayton County Habitat for Humanity has dedicated its newest house, and it will
become the residence of Donna Phillips and her family.

"Delta House" was built in two weeks by more than 120 Delta Air Lines employees,
including upper management officials.

The house, on Third Street in Forest Park, was built on a parcel donated by
Harvey Osborne. Also pitching in were Clayton Habitat volunteers and helpers
from the U.S. Army Reserve at Fort Gillem.

The Clayton County Extension Service provided landscaping for the house, the
12th built by Clayton's Habitat chapter.

South Fulton forum set. Fulton County Commissioner Michael Hightower will hold a
public discussion Tuesday at 6 p.m. on the South Fulton Revitalization Plan. The
forum at the South Fulton Annex, 5600 Stonewall Tell Road, will be held in
conjunction with this month's Fulton County Planning Commission meeting.

"This is a great opportunity for our citizens to help us fine-tune a strategy
that will let south Fulton realize its destiny as one of the most desirable
places in metro Atlanta to own a home, locate a business, hold a job or enjoy
cultural amenities," Hightower said.

The plan, funded by a $ 75,000 grant, is designed to market and promote the area
and to clarify misconceptions.

The area covered by the plan involves parts or all of the cities of College
Park, East Point Fairburn, Hapeville, Palmetto and Union City.

For information, call 730-8308.

Chronic pain center open. Southern Regional Medical Center has opened its new
Pain Management Center. With four doctors who specialize in pain care, the
facility is devoted to addressing and relieving chronic pain. The center has
flexible hours and is expected to treat 100 patients monthly.

"Patients come to us most often for chronic back or neck pain, headaches,
shingles, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and, of course, cancer pain," said Dr.
Richard Lodise. "We are often the last stop for people who believe that they
have tried everything."

Delta Dental Makes Record-Setting Gift to the University of Texas School of
Dentistry

LENGTH: 434  words


New Delhi, Dec. 1 -- Delta Dental Insurance Company today presented a check for
$350,000 to The University of Texas School of Dentistry at Houston (UTSD) - the
largest corporate-based contribution in the school's five-year fundraising
campaign.

The grant will fund the Delta Dental Assessment and Clinical Research Clinic in
the new dental school building, serving new patients and accommodating the
school's student and faculty researchers.

The gift is the largest company contribution in the five-year history of UTSD's
"Open to Health" fundraising initiative. Funds received by the School of
Dentistry during the initiative now total approximately $16.4 million.

"UTSD has a long and proud history of helping the community, which aligns with
Delta Dental's mission of increasing access to dental care," said John Yamamoto,
DDS, vice president of Professional Services for Delta Dental. "We are honored
to participate with the project's founders, contributors and leadership, who all
share a vision to increase access to dental care for underserved populations."

Since its inception, UTSD has provided quality patient care through its
educational programs in Houston and throughout Texas. In addition to operating
general and specialty clinics and maintaining affiliations with hospitals,
community agencies, health care centers and schools, the School of Dentistry
sponsors a Mobile Dental Van Program to care for patients in remote locations
who are unable to attend regular clinics.

"We very much appreciate Delta Dental's support for our new school," said UTSD
Dean John A. Valenza, DDS. "Gifts like this help us keep the cost of oral health
care among the most affordable in the country, while ensuring that our future
dentists and dental hygienists have a chance to learn their professions in
state-of-the art facilities."

Also attending today's presentation at the school was Rep. Carol Alvarado of
Houston, who serves on the Texas House of Representatives' Public Health
Committee. "UTSD has proven itself to be one of the premiere dental schools in
Texas with exceptional students and faculty," Alvarado said. "Delta Dental's
significant contribution will allow UTSD to continue improving oral health care
and provide needed services within the community."

Delta Dental currently administers the dental portion of the Texas Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) program, serving 540,000 Texas children.
Beginning March 1, 2012, the company will also be one of three administrators
for the new Texas Medicaid dental program, which will cover approximately 3.1
million Medicaid and Texas CHIP members.

New foundation trying to improve healthcare in Mississippi

BYLINE: Laura Smith

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 559  words


The Healthcare Foundation of the Tri-State Delta has a mission to improve the
health of residents in Delta communities, and that mission continues through the
tough times the economy presents.

"We are at the epicenter of the healthcare crisis," said Ray Humphreys, CEO and
president of the Delta Regional Medical Center (DRMC). "So we have a great
responsibility to do all we can. "

Humphreys said the Delta has aging facilities and inadequate capabilities to
serve its residents' healthcare needs.

"We feel we have an obligation to continue to meet the healthcare needs of the
Delta," he said.

With that in mind came the creation of The Healthcare Foundation of the
Tri-State Delta.

"We've created a foundation, as many hospitals have done, and the purpose of
ours is to go throughout the nation to find funding. There's not enough public
funding from state and federal sources, so we're looking to private sources. "

In addition to applying for grants for DRMC, the foundation will seek funds from
private donors across the country to build a new hospital in Greenville.

"We hope to put an effective healthcare system in place to address the needs of
the Delta," he said.

Those needs, he noted, are new facilities and more doctors.

"The foundation is a way that helps us open doors," he said. "Giving to
charities of all types has declined somewhat; that's something charities like
the Salvation Army and United Way are facing, but that doesn't mean we should
quit seeking funding.

"It may be more difficult, we know that, but it doesn't mean we should quit
seeking those funds. "

Humphreys said large donors still have money to give, and they still have the
desire and the heart to address those needs.

The foundation has moved forward with its plans with the hiring of David Dallas,
a Cleveland native, as its executive director.

Dallas' previous experience includes his position as executive director of the
Bologna Performing Arts Center in Cleveland. He has a master's degree from
Mississippi State University in public policy and administration.

Among his grant management experience is his six-year tenure with the United
States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, where he
administered a $40-million grant program with the Newly Independent States of
the Former Soviet Union under the FREEDOM Support Act.

Starting Nov. 1, Dallas will head the foundation as it moves forward with a
capital campaign to build the new hospital.

Meanwhile, the foundation is moving forward with plans for the new healthcare
system.

The 180-acre site for the new hospital, in South Greenville, was purchased six
years ago.

Humphreys said funding has been secured to start developing the road system
around the property. He said he anticipates some of the roadwork to begin in
March 2010, and hospital support facilities that would surround the new hospital
could be constructed in 2010, as well.

The ultimate goal is to use the medical center's existing facilities to offer
medical services that will create a total healthcare system that addresses the
Delta's needs.

Humphreys said he's eager to get the Delta's story a dire need for quality

healthcare out across the nation.

"We have a compelling story," he said. "We're serious about it. The community
wants it, needs it and sees a need for it. There's a critical interest in
helping us do something. "

considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and has made a
determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests
of the Government. In addition, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made
available by this or any other Act may be available for a contract, grant, or
cooperative agreement with an entity that requires employees or contractors of
such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal
confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting
such employees or contractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or
abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a
Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
Additionally, no funds appropriated in this or any other Act may be used to
implement or enforce the agreements in Standard Forms 312 and 4414 of the
Government or any other nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement if such policy,
form, or agreement does not contain the following provisions: "These provisions
are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the
employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by existing statute or
Executive order relating to (1) classified information, (2) communications to
Congress, (3) the reporting to an Inspector General of a violation of any law,
rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of
authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or

funding restrictions identified under Section D.6.

  (e) Applications will be deemed ineligible if the application is not complete
in accordance with the requirements stated in Section C.3.g.
 <h4>
  2. Cost Sharing or Matching</h4>

  Matching funds are not required. However, if you are adding any other
contributions to the proposed Project, you must provide documentation indicating
who will be providing the matching funds, the amount of funds, when those funds
will be provided, and how the funds will be used in the project budget. Examples
of acceptable documentation include: A signed letter from the source of funds
stating the amount of funds, when the funds will be provided, and what the funds
can be used for or a signed resolution from your governing board authorizing the
use of a specified amount of funds for specific components of the project. The
matching funds you identify must be for eligible purposes and included in your
work plan and budget. Additionally, expected program income may not be used as
matching funds at the time you submit your application. However, if you have a
contract to provide services in place at the time you submit your application,
you can verify the amount of the contract as matching funds. If you choose, you
may use a template to summarize the matching funds. The template is available
either from your Rural Development State Office or the program Web site at: .
 <h4>
  3. Other Eligibility Requirements</h4>

  The following additional eligibility requirements apply to this program:

  (a) Use of Funds. An application must propose to use Project funds, including
grant and other contributions committed under the evaluation criteria for
eligible purposes. Eligible Project purposes include the development of:


   Health care services;

   health education programs;

   health care job training programs; and

   the development and expansion of public health-related facilities in the
Delta Region.


  (b) Project Area. The proposed Project must take place in a Rural Area within
the Delta Region as defined in this Notice. However, the applicant need not
propose to serve the entire Delta Region.

based upon the complexity of the project. Your proposed grant period should
begin no earlier than October 1, 2016, and should end no later than 24 months
following that date. If you receive an award, your grant period will be revised
to begin on the actual date of award--the date the grant agreement is executed
by the Agency--and your grant period end date will be adjusted accordingly. Your
Project activities must begin within 90 days of the date of award. If you
request funds for a time period beginning before October 1, 2016, and/or ending
later than 24 months from that date, your application will be ineligible. The
length of your grant period should be based on your Project's complexity, as
indicated in your application work plan.

  (e) Multiple Grant Requests. The Consortium, including its members, is limited
to submitting one application for funding under this Notice. We will not accept
applications from Consortiums that include members who are also members of other
Consortiums that have submitted applications for funding under this Notice. If
we discover that a Consortium member is a member of multiple Consortiums with
applications submitted for funding under this Notice, all applications will be
considered ineligible for funding.

  (f) Performance on Existing DHCS Awards. If the lead entity, or any of its
Consortium members, has an existing DHCS award, they must be performing
satisfactorily to be considered eligible for a funding under this Notice.
Satisfactory performance includes, but is not limited to, being up-to-date on
all financial and performance reports and being current on all tasks as approved
in the work plan. The Agency will use its discretion to make this determination.


  (g) Completeness. Your application must provide all of the information
requested in Section D.2. of this Notice. Applications lacking sufficient
information to determine eligibility and scoring will be deemed ineligible and
will not be considered for scoring.

  (h) Indirect Costs. Your negotiated indirect cost rate approval does not need

businesses as a result of assistance from your organization. When you calculate
jobs saved, estimates should be based only on actual jobs that would have been
lost if your organization did not receive DHCS funding or actual jobs that would
have been lost without assistance from your organization.

  You can also suggest additional performance elements for example where job
creation or jobs saved may not be a relevant indicator. These additional

  5. Intergovernmental Review.

  Executive Order (EO) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,
applies to this program. This EO requires that Federal agencies provide
opportunities for consultation on proposed assistance with State and local
governments. Many States have established a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to
facilitate this consultation. A list of States that maintain a SPOC may be
obtained at . If your State has a SPOC, you may submit your application directly
for review. Any comments obtained through the SPOC must be provided to Rural
Development for consideration as part of your application. If your State has not

Rural Development will submit your application to the SPOC or other appropriate
agency or agencies.

  You are also encouraged to contact Cooperative Programs at 202-690-1374 or if
you have questions about this process.

  6. Funding Restrictions.

  The use of project funds, including grant funds and other contributions,
cannot be used for ineligible purposes. In addition, you shall not use project
funds for the following:

  (a) To duplicate current services or to replace or to substitute support
previously provided. However, project funds may be used to expand the level of
effort or a service beyond what is currently being provided;

  (b) To pay for costs to prepare the application for funding under this Notice;

any of the following:


   Requests more than the maximum grant amount: or

   Proposes ineligible costs that equal more than 10 percent of the project
funds.


  If you include funds in your budget that are for ineligible purposes, we will
consider the application for funding if the ineligible purposes total 10 percent
or less of an applicant's project funds. However, if the application is
successful, those ineligible costs must be removed from the work plan and budget
and replaced with eligible costs before we will make the grant award, or the
grant award will be reduced accordingly. If we cannot determine the percentage
of ineligible costs, the application will not be considered for funding.

  7. Other Submission Requirements.

  (a) You should not submit your application in more than one format. You must
choose whether to submit your application in hard copy or electronically.

not required to access the Web site.

  (b) National Environmental Policy Act.

  This Notice has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970,
"Environmental Policies and Procedures." We have determined that an
Environmental Impact Statement is not required because the issuance of
regulations and instructions, as well as amendments to them, describing
administrative and financial procedures for processing, approving, and
implementing the Agency's financial programs is categorically excluded in the
Agency's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulation found at 7 CFR
1970.53(f), "Environmental Policies and Procedures." We have determined that
this Notice does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment.

  (c) Civil Rights Compliance Requirements.

  All grants made under this Notice are subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 as required by the USDA (7 CFR part 15, subpart A) and Section 504

Title IX, Executive Order 13166 (Limited English Proficiency), Executive Order
11246, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974.
 <h3>
  E. Application Review Information</h3>

  We will review your application to determine if it is complete and eligible.
If at any time we determine that your application is ineligible, you will be
notified in writing as to the reasons it was determined ineligible and you will
be informed of your review and appeal rights.

  We will only score applications in which the lead entity, partnering
Consortium member entities, and the project are eligible. The applications must
also be complete and sufficiently responsive to program requirements.

  We will review each application to determine if it is eligible for funding and
complete, based on the requirements of this Notice as well as other applicable
Federal regulations.

  Applications that are determined to be eligible and complete will be evaluated
based on the criteria described below.

  1. Criteria.

  For each criterion, you must show how the Project has merit and why it is
likely to be successful. If you do not address all parts of a criterion your
application will be deemed ineligible. If you do not sufficiently communicate
relevant Project information, you will receive lower scores. DHCS is a
competitive program, so you will receive scores based on the quality of your
responses. Simply addressing the criteria will not guarantee higher scores.
Evaluators will base scores only on the information provided or cross-referenced
by page number in each individual evaluation criterion. The maximum number of
points that can be awarded to your application is 100. The minimum score
requirement for funding is 60 points. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund
applications with a score of 59 points or less if it is in the best interest of
the Federal government.

  The evaluation criteria are detailed in the DHCS Grant Application Guide which
can be found at . You must address each evaluation criterion outlined in this
Notice. Any criterion not substantively addressed will receive zero points.
There are three criteria totaling 100 points. They are listed below:

  (a) Rurality of the Project and communities served (maximum of 30 points)--The
rurality of the communities served by the Project is an objective criterion that
measures the rurality of the Project's service area. It is determined by the
population of the community based upon the 2010 U.S. Census data available on
the American Fact Finder Web site--. If you have multiple addresses in the same
community (city, town or census designated place), please only list the
community once when preparing your rurality calculation. The rurality
calculation provided in the application will be checked and, if necessary,
corrected by us.

      0





  (b) The Community Needs and Benefits derived from the Project (maximum of 30
points)--We will assess how the Project will benefit the residents in the Delta
Region. This criterion will be scored based on the documentation in support of
the community needs for health services and public health-related facilities and
the benefits to people living in Delta Regional derived from the implementation
of the proposed Project. It should lead clearly to the identification of the
Project participant pool and the target population for the Project, and provide
convincing links between the Project and the benefits to the community to
address its health needs. RBS will consider:

  (1) The extent of the applicant's documentation explaining the health care
needs, issues, and challenges facing the service area. Include what problems the
residents face and how the Project will benefit the residents in the region.

  (2) The extent to which the applicant is able to show the relationship between
the Project's design, outcome, and benefits.

  (3) The extent to which the applicant explains the Project and its
implementation and provides milestones which are well-defined and can be
realistically completed.

  (4) The extent to which the applicant clearly outlines a plan to track,
report, and evaluate performance outcomes.

  Applicants should attempt to quantify benefits in terms of outcomes from the
Project; that is, ways in which peoples' lives, or the community, will be
improved. Provide estimates of the number of people affected by the benefits
arising from the project.

  (c) The Project Management and Organization Capability (maximum of 40
points)--We will evaluate the Consortium's experience, past performance, and
accomplishments addressing health care issues to ensure effective Project
implementation. This criterion will be scored based on the documentation of the
Project's management and organizational capability. RBS will consider:

  (1) The degree to which the organization has a sound management and fiscal
structure including: Well-defined roles for administrators, staff, and
established financial management systems.

  (2) The extent to which the applicant identifies and demonstrates that
qualifications, capabilities, and educational background of the identified key
personnel (at a minimum the Project Manager) who will manage and implement
programs are relevant and will contribute to the success of the Project.

  (3) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates current successful and
effective experience (or demonstrated experience within the past 5 years)
addressing the health care issues in the Delta Region.

  (4) The extent to which the applicant has experience managing grant-funded
programs.

  (5) The extent to which the applicant is able to correlate and support the
budget to the project phases and implementation timeline.

  (6) The extent to which administrative/management costs are balanced with
funds designated for the provision of programs and services.

  (7) The extent and diversity of eligible entity types within the applicant's
Consortium of regional institutions of higher education, academic health and
research institutes and economic development entities located in the Delta
Region.

  2. Review and Selection Process.

  The State Offices will review applications to determine if they are eligible
for assistance based on requirements in this Notice and other applicable Federal
regulations. If determined eligible, your application will be scored by a panel
of National and State Office employees in accordance with the point allocation
specified in this Notice. A recommendation will be submitted to the
Administrator to fund applications in highest ranking order, subject to
availability of funds. It is at the Agency's discretion to fund applications
with a score of 59 points or less if it is in the best interest of the Federal
government. If your application is evaluated, but not funded, it will not be
carried forward into the next competition.
 <h3>
  F. Federal Award Administration Information</h3>

  1. Federal Award Notices.

  If you are selected for funding, you will receive a signed notice of Federal
award by postal mail from the State Office where your application was submitted,
containing instructions on requirements necessary to proceed with execution and
performance of the award. You must comply with all applicable statutes,
regulations, and notice requirements before the grant award will be approved. We
recognize that each funded Project is unique and therefore the terms and
conditions of each award may vary. We will notify applicants whose applications
are selected for funding by sending a letter of conditions, which must be met
before the award can be finalized.

  Once the conditions of the award are met, we will issue a grant agreement,
which must be signed by the lead entity and us before the period of performance
can begin. The lead entity may administer the award using the traditional
subaward approach to the other Consortium members.

  If you are not selected for funding, you will be notified in writing via
postal mail and informed of any review and appeal rights. See 7 CFR part 11 for
USDA National Appeals Division procedures. Funding of successfully appealed

CGI LANDS ITS TOP U.S. CONTRACT: Aided by its recent acquisition of IMRglobal
Corp. of Clearwater, Canadian computer consultant CGI Group has won its
biggest-ever contract in the United States. CGI said it was chosen by Fireman's
Fund Insurance Co., a subsidiary of insurance giant Allianz AG of Munich, for a
10-year contract valued at $ 350-million to $ 400-million. As part of the deal,
CGI will provide information technology support to 80 Fireman's locations in the
United States. CGI also will take over Fireman's Phoenix data center, and 300
Fireman's Fund employees will now work for CGI. Eileen Murphy, a CGI
spokeswoman, said the company's recent expansion through its $ 438-million
purchase of IMRglobal helped it win the contract.

BLUECROSS SETS UP FOUNDATION: BlueCross BlueShield of Florida has established a
charitable foundation to address health needs of the underserved and uninsured
in the state. The not-for-profit group is being funded with $ 5-million from the
Jacksonville health insurer. BlueCross BlueShield also has agreed to underwrite
the foundation so it can award up to $ 1-million in grants each year to Florida
non-profit organizations that propose innovative ways to make health care more
accessible. Applications are being accepted, with grants scheduled for October
and April. Susan Towler, former director of public relations for BlueCross
BlueShield, will be executive director of the Blue Foundation for a Healthy
Florida Inc.

UNION SEEKS VOTE AT DELTA: The Association of Flight Attendants said it plans to
file a petition today with the National Mediation Board asking for a
unionization election by Delta Air Lines' 20,000 attendants. The union must
present the Mediation Board with the signatures of 35 percent of the eligible
workers to get an election. To organize the flight attendants at Delta, the
least unionized major U.S. airline, the union would need more than 50 percent of
the flight attendants to return mailed ballots approving the election. The AFA
represents about 50,000 flight attendants, including those at United Airlines
and US Airways.

CVS SETTLES JUSTICE CHARGES: CVS Corp. has paid $ 4-million to settle claims
that the drugstore chain overcharged government health insurance programs for
partly filled prescriptions. The allegations were made in a whistle-blower
lawsuit against Revco Drugstores Inc., which CVS bought in 1997. They cover the
period from January 1988 to June 1997. CVS, of Woonsocket, R.I., entered the
Tampa Bay area market two years ago with stores in Brandon and Tampa. Locations
are under development in St. Petersburg and Largo. One of CVS' main local
competitors, Largo's Eckerd Corp., settled similar charges in late July, paying
a $ 1.7-million fine. In 1999, another competitor, Walgreen Co., agreed to pay $
7.6-million to end state and federal allegations.

MEDICAL GROUP TO JOIN LAWSUIT: The Florida Medical Association said it will join
a federal lawsuit that claims Aetna Inc., Cigna Corp. and other U.S. health
insurers broke contracts and cut payments to physicians. The association, which
represents 16,000 doctors, said its board decided to sue last month because a
2-year-old Florida law requiring insurers to pay claims promptly wasn't working
and after talks with insurers failed.

Delta Dental of Oklahoma awards grants

BYLINE: Journal Record Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1242  words


The board of trustees of the Delta Dental of Oklahoma Oral Health Foundation has
awarded $1.3 million in grants to 31 organizations throughout the state for
dental health and education-related programs.

"Delta Dental of Oklahoma is committed to supporting the efforts of volunteer
dental professionals and to advancing oral health in our state," said John
Gladden, president and CEO of Delta Dental of Oklahoma. "We're proud to partner
with these groups who are serving a wide variety of needs and making a
difference in the lives of so many. "

Delta Dental of Oklahoma, a not-for-profit dental benefits company based in
Oklahoma City, has contributed more than $12 million for dental health and
education programs through its Oral Health Foundation since 1998.

The most recent grants included $100,000 to Neighborhood Services Organization
for its capital campaign for a new dental clinic.

The new clinic will be five times larger than NSO's current space and feature
five exam rooms, a large waiting area, lab, sterile room, offices and a patient
restroom.

"We're so excited to partner with Delta Dental on our capital campaign," said
Stacey Ninness, NSO president and CEO. "They've been extremely supportive of our
dental clinic in the past, and their support means we'll be able to offer dental
care to even more uninsured Oklahomans in the future. "

NSO's capital campaign is to construct a new dental clinic and administrative
services facility to replace its former home, a 96-year-old Methodist church at
SW 11th Street and S. Walker Avenue. The old facility has been demolished.

John Gladden, president and CEO of Delta Dental of Oklahoma and
secretary-treasurer of its Oral Health Foundation, said by offering reduced-fee
services to low-income uninsured patients, NSO Dental Clinic significantly
reduces the demand on the free dental clinics they support.

"The clinic is a vital part of the oral health care safety net and we encourage
others to support their capital campaign with a year-end gift," Gladden said.
"We're proud to partner with NSO to empower more Oklahomans to get the dental
care they need. "

NSO's dental clinic is a reduced-cost dental clinic that offers emergency
appointments, digital X-rays and paperless charts. The part-time clinic sees
approximately 2,000 patients and performs 6,000 procedures each year. Services
are offered to patients as young as 8 years old without regard for insured
status or income.

Delta Dental also awarded $75,000 for the Neighborhood Service Organization
low-cost dental clinic; $2,000 to provide free dental care to its transitional
living clients; and $1,500 for its oral health community outreach program.

Delta Dental also awarded grants to programs serving the entire state.

MobileSmiles Oklahoma was awarded $240,000. MobileSmiles is a partnership
program of the Delta Dental of Oklahoma Oral Health Foundation and Oklahoma
Dental Foundation that delivers dental care statewide using two RV-style dental
offices on wheels.

Dentists for the Disabled and Elderly in Need of Treatment, known as D-DENT, was
awarded $110,000 to provide free dental care and dentures to disabled, elderly,
and low-income patients and veterans with the help of volunteer dentists.

and gives away toothbrushes to elementary school students, was awarded $47,000.

The American College of Dentists Foundation was awarded $10,000 for its Dental
Ethics Education program.

$75,000 grant to aid cancer program at MMC

LENGTH: 1003 words


SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield's corporate foundation
presented this week a $75,000 grant to American Cancer Society's Patient
Navigator program at Maine Medical Center's Cancer Institute.


Most people who have been diagnosed with cancer are struggling to understand
their illness and really don't know what to do. A patient navigator is a skilled
professional who can connect patients with all kinds of resources in the
community. The American Cancer Society's Patient Navigator Program creates
one-on-one relationships between newly diagnosed patients and trained patient
navigators, who provide information, support and personal guidance throughout a
cancer experience.


Overall, the program has seen more than 2,200 Maine cancer patients since the
program was established in June 2008. Patient Navigator services are free and
confidential. Northeast Delta Dental opens kiosk at Maine Mall


SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine -- Northeast Delta Dental now has a self-service kiosk,
the Northeast Delta Dental Smile Center, at The Maine Mall. The kiosk is
equipped with two touch-screen monitors that enable consumers to take a free
oral health risk assessment and be entered into a monthly drawing for an
electric toothbrush. In creating the kiosk, Northeast Delta Dental partnered
with Wide Angle Marketing, The Maine Mall and PreViser Corp.


A PreViser tool scores the OHRA, and the results are emailed directly to the
consumer, accompanied by assessment results and a recommendation for customized
individual and family plan dental benefits. The recommendation directs consumers
to a website, DeltaDentalCoversMe.com, where the recommended plan may be
purchased. Consumers must be over 18 years old. Individual and family dental
benefits are designed for people with no access to employer-sponsored group
dental insurance.


Delta Dental Plan of Maine is one of three Delta Dental Plans doing business
jointly as Northeast Delta Dental, with corporate headquarters in Concord, N.H.,
and a sales office in Saco. Northeast Delta Dental administers dental benefits
in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, offering dental insurance programs for
organizations of all sizes and individuals and families.


Northeast Delta Dental is affiliated nationally with Delta Dental Plans
Association, and it is the first member company to use a self-service kiosk in
its marketing efforts.PCHC board of directors appoints new member


BANGOR, Maine â[#x20ac]" Penobscot Community Health Care recently announced that

joined its board of directors.


Winstead, who has served as Michaud's district representative since 2011, was
also a compliance/field director for the Maine Democratic Party, and has
experience in the banking industry. Winstead is pursuing a business management

Theatre Company and Junior Achievement of Bangor.


PCHC is a federally qualified health center, and its board of directors serves

requirements.Avon Breast Health Outreach Program awards grant for Breast Cancer
Awareness Program to Caring Connections


BANGOR, Maine -- The Avon Breast Health Outreach Program has awarded a $19,500
one-year grant to Caring Connections, a cooperative women's health program
between the Bangor YMCA and Eastern Maine Medical Center, to increase awareness
of the lifesaving benefits of early detection of breast cancer. It is the eighth
year that the program has received funding from the Avon Foundation for Women.


The Caring Connections breast health program will educate women in eastern Maine
and refer them to free mammograms and clinical breast exams. This vital program
will also assist women with overcoming other barriers to receiving health
services.


Since December 1996, Caring Connections has reached tens of thousands of women
with information about the importance of early detection of breast cancer and
has referred nearly 1,400 women for mammograms and clinical breast exams. More
than 3,350 screenings have been conducted through the Caring Connections
program. Should further diagnostic tests or treatment of breast cancer be
necessary, EMMC has made the commitment to cover all of its own costs in the
provision of these services when needed.


Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer (other than skin cancer) in
women in the United States and breast cancer is the leading single cause of
death for women between the ages of 40 and 55. According to the American Cancer
Society 1,170 new cases of breast cancer will be detected in Maine this year and
170 lives will be lost. Nationwide, there is a new diagnosis every three minutes
and a death from breast cancer every 14 minutes. While advances have been made
in prevention, diagnosis and treatment, early detection still affords the best
opportunity for successful treatment.


"We are proud that the Avon Foundation for Women shares our mission and has
chosen to support our program. With these funds we will be able to reach out to
more women and eliminate the barriers they may face when seeking these
life-saving tests" Suzanne Brunner, Caring Connections director, said in a
recent press release.


Since 1993, the Avon Foundation has awarded 1,550 grants to community-based
breast health programs across the country, including Caring Connections. These
programs are dedicated to educating underserved women about breast cancer and
linking them to early detection screening services.

Joseph Sams School planning to build $ 800,000 facility

BYLINE: Anne Hart; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA; Pg. 06M

LENGTH: 395 words


When the Joseph Sams School, formerly called The Early Years, moves into its
proposed facility early next year, student and wheelchair-user Andrew Babb will
be able to easily access the new $ 800,000 building.

Babb, 10, who has cerebral palsy, is one of 30 students who attend Joseph Sams
School for children ages 2 to 16 with special physical and intellectual needs.

"We know Andrew is going to need long-term care," said Andrew's father, Johnny
Babb of McDonough. "The school is geared to do all that it can to serve those
needs as Andrew grows. As the students grow older, the school expanded to meet
their needs."

The proposed new school, to be located on four acres on Brandywine Road behind
Fayette Medical Center, will be fully wheelchair accessible and almost twice the
size of the school's current 6,000-square-foot facility on Johnson Avenue in
Fayetteville.

"We're on the verge of a brave new world," said Janet Smola, director of the
school's fund-raising .

The 13-year-old private school, renamed in honor of Jim and Marie Sams' son who
died of leukemia in August, will serve up to 100 children while maintaining its
current 3-to-1 student-teacher ratio.

"We provide a service that is nonexistent anywhere else in the metro area,"
Smola said. "We were turning children away because we didn't have enough room."

Each child at Sams costs about $ 16,000 a year to educate depending on their
needs, Smola said. Thanks to various scholarship programs, the highest tution
paid is about $ 5,000 a year.

The school, which has students from seven counties including Fayette, plans to
finance the new facility with donated funds and services, said Smola. Local
contributors include Georgia Baptist Healthcare System, Southeastern Engineeers
Inc., Cobb Associates architecture firm, Delta Air Lines, Walker Concrete Co.
and attorney Bill McNally.

The school will include a physical therapy room, a media center, a speech/group
therapy room, a commons area, a computer lab and an independent living
instruction area. Construction is set to begin April 2.

The new facility, coupled with the name change, means the school is even more
prepared to provide a full range of services as a fully accredited educational
program, Smola said.

"We're a school the same way Fayette County High School is a school," Smola
said. "We are not a day-care."

United and Delta Increase Pressure On Employees For Concessions

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Milt Freudenheim contributed reporting for this
article.

SECTION: Section C; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 712 words


Two troubled airlines stepped up their efforts yesterday to persuade their
unions to grant contract concessions aimed at helping the companies cut costs.

United Airlines said yesterday that it might ask a federal bankruptcy judge for
permission to reduce the health care benefits of its 35,000 retirees. The
airline said it hoped to reach agreements with its unions without asking a court
to impose the cuts, a step other bankrupt companies, notably those in the steel
industry, have taken.

United has reapplied for $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees, which would
provide the centerpiece of its restructuring plan. Its first application was
rejected in December 2002, sending the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, the chief executive at Delta Air Lines, Gerald Grinstein, pressed the
union's 8,500 pilots to grant wage and benefit cuts, but the pilots' union said
it might put off negotiations until closer to the time when its contract expires
next year.

Mr. Grinstein's comments came after Delta reported a narrower fourth-quarter
loss compared with 2003, but saw its debt downgraded further into junk
territory. Both actions came as the airline industry is hoping for a rebound in
traffic this year that would end a slump that began in 2000.

United said it wanted retirees to pay more of the cost of their health care.

"This change will bring the medical benefits provided to current retirees more
in line" with those provided at other companies and those that will be provided
to future United retirees, said Peter D. McDonald, United's executive vice
president for operations, in a statement.

United's position is shared by several large corporations. The nation's biggest
companies and their retirees spent $20.6 billion for health benefits in 2003, a
13.7 percent increase from $18.1 billion in 2002, according to survey results
announced yesterday by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates, a
benefits consulting firm.

Forty, or almost 10 percent, of the 408 large employers surveyed said they
decided last year to eliminate subsidized health benefits for future retirees,
and 71 percent raised the share of premiums paid by current retirees who are
still covered. More than 8 in 10 said they would increase retiree contributions
within three years. The survey, conducted last summer before Congress approved
expanded Medicare benefits, included companies with 1,000 or more workers.

The suggestion that United might file a motion seeking to reduce benefits came
about eight months after the airline, a unit of the UAL Corporation, won $2.56
billion in annual labor cost reductions from its unions.

United's flight attendants were particularly upset by the move. In a statement
yesterday, their union said 2,500 flight attendants had agreed to retire early,
in return for the airline's pledge to protect their benefits. Instead, said the
union, the flight attendants now face the prospect of losing those benefits as a
result of trying to help the airline.

Over the years, a variety of companies have filed or considered filing requests
with bankruptcy courts to reduce or eliminate retirees' benefits. They include
Kaiser Aluminum, Polaroid, Federated Department Stores, and particularly, a host
of steel companies, including Kaiser, National and Bethlehem Steel.

US Airways, which did not ask a court to reduce retirees' benefits when it
emerged from bankruptcy last year, is now seeking to cut an additional $200
million to $300 million in costs. It says it may sell major assets like its East
Coast shuttle or one of its three hubs to raise the money.

At Delta, company executives said they were disappointed by the fourth-quarter
results. The airline lost $327 million in the quarter.

Though that was better than the $363 million loss in the year-earlier quarter,
analysts said the performance could be the worst among major airlines for the
period. For 2003, Delta lost $773 million, the first time in three years that
its loss was less than $1 billion. But Delta forecast a loss for the first
quarter.

The airline's continued losses prompted Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to
cut Delta's rating to B-plus from BB-minus. The agency kept Delta on CreditWatch
with negative implications, meaning its rating could be cut again.

Mississippi Senator Cochran questions proposed chronic disease grants

BYLINE: Mississippi Business Journal Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 306  words


U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) is asking the Secretary of Health and Human
Services to explain how plans to create a chronic disease grant program would
benefit rural states like Mississippi that might not have the resources to
effectively compete for the new grants.

Cochran serves on the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education
Appropriations Subcommittee that conducted a hearing March 30 to review the
Obama administration's budget request for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS). As part of that hearing, Cochran submitted a question
asking HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to explain how rural or disadvantaged
communities would be affected by awarding preventive health grants on a
competitive rather than a formula basis.

Cochran has asked Sebelius to explain what plans HHS and the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) will develop to ensure that state health departments have the
capacity to compete for funding under the new grant program.

Currently, the Mississippi Department of Health qualifies for Preventive Health
and Health Services Block Grant Program (PHHSBG) funding. These federal
resources are used for a range of preventive health initiatives like community
health promotion, disease control, water fluoridation and school health
education.

The FY2012 budget proposes eliminating PHHSBG and replacing it with a new
chronic disease grant program. Unlike PHHSBG awards that are distributed to
states through a formula basis, the new grants would be issued on a competitive
basis.

Cochran also asked Sebelius to address HHS plans for specifically dealing with
health-related problems in the Mississippi Delta if Congress agrees to the Obama
administration's budget recommendation to eliminate the Delta Health Alliance
and Delta Chronic Disease Assessment.

Grant Allows Midwestern University to Expand Dental Care at DuPage Schools

BYLINE: Jill Blair-Smith

SECTION: SUBMITTED CONTENT; Pg. 0

LENGTH: 357 words


Midwestern University recently received a $10,000 grant from Delta Dental to
improve dental care in DuPage County and provide additional clinical experience
for students. With the grant, the University's College of Dental
Medicine-Illinois (CDMI) was able to purchase a complete portable dental system
including a portable dental care unit, portable dental light, and operator
stools.

The equipment will be used in cooperation with the DuPage County Health
Department's Mobile Dental Clinic, which travels to area schools to provide
exams and preventive services to at-risk children. Every year, approximately
5,000 children receive dental services in schools as part of the program that
targets children who do not have dental insurance and come from low-income
families.

"This new mobile unit allows students from the College of Dental
Medicine-Illinois to travel with the DuPage County Mobile Dental Clinic and
participate in their established program of providing screenings, sealants,
fluoride applications, and other dental care services to children in need," said
Larry Williams, D.D.S., Assistant Professor, CDMI. "Currently, our dental
medicine students participate in rotations at various sites providing care to
underserved communities. This grant allows us to expand our capability to help
those in need by providing dental care at schools on a regular basis," Dr.
Williams said. The equipment can also be used by Midwestern students at other
venues throughout DuPage County to provide access to dental services for
low-income residents of all ages.

Midwestern University spearheaded the effort to obtain the grant from the Delta
Dental Insurance Company, which donates more than $5.5 million annually in
support of programs focusing on prevention of dental disease, increased access
to care, advancement in dental science, and exploring the connections between
oral and overall health. The College of Dental Medicine-Illinois prepares
students to earn the Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.) degree and gain the
knowledge, skills, judgment, and respect for patients necessary for a successful
independent and ethical dental practice.

Financial relationship between University of Mississippi Medical Center, DHA
remains in place

BYLINE: Clay Chandler

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 636  words


Mentioned throughout the court file of James Hahn's wrongful termination lawsuit
against the Delta Health Alliance is a possible grant from DHA to University of
Mississippi Medical Center to help the hospital pay for implementing electronic
health records.

The hospital's move toward EHRs is part of the mandates spelled out in the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A hospital spokesman told the
Mississippi Business Journal in early November that the process would cost $70
million over the next five years.

In a motion for summary judgment, DHA attorneys asked Lafayette County Circuit
Judge John Gregory to bar Hahn's attorney, Jim Waide, from seeking information
about DHA possibly awarding a multi-million dollar grant to UMMC to implement
EHRs, contingent upon the hospital using Chicago-based Allscripts as its
software provider. In 2008, according to court filings, DHA paid Allscripts
$1.775 million. DHA attorneys argued Waide's seeking information about the grant
during discovery was improper, because Hahn had not mentioned the claims in his
original complaint.

Hahn, who was DHA's senior vice president of programs before his May 2010
termination, said in his initial complaint that DHA CEO Dr. Karen Fox had
improperly spent agency money for personal expenses, including a condo in
Oxford, babysitting services and to pay an attorney for a private legal matter.
The nonprofit's board of directors approved each of the expenses, in a
resolution adopted about three months after Hahn filed suit. The case settled
last May, with the terms under seal. Fox, who remains DHA's CEO, is now under
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of
Mississippi. Her attorney told the MBJ in late November he's confident she will
be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Jack Mazurak, spokesperson for UMMC, wrote in an email to the MBJ that between
July 2006 and June 2009, the hospital received a grant from the federal Health
Resources and Services Administration that was administered through DHA via a
sub-agreement between the hospital and the nonprofit.

Under the agreement, the hospital was awarded a budget of $3.5 million to
implement EHRs. The grant was on a reimbursement basis; and between fiscal year
2007 and FY 2009, Mazurak wrote, the hospital invoiced DHA for $3.2 million for
the project. Roy Campbell III, a Jackson attorney who represents DHA, said in an
email to the MBJ that the total budgeted amount for the project was $6.7
million. Mazurak and Campbell each said the sub-grant remains active.

In a phone interview, Mazurak said when the grant was first awarded, Allscripts
was one of the vendors selected after a Request for Proposals to implement EHRs
at some of UMMC's outpatient facilities that serve the Delta. One of the
modifications made to the grant's terms was the selection of a new vendor whose
technology would allow connectivity between EHRs at the hospital's outpatient
facilities and those at the primary inpatient hospital in Jackson.

"The original grant was not specific to Allscripts," Mazurak said, when he was
asked if the grant was contingent upon the hospital using the Chicago company.
The only conditions attached to the grant, Mazurak added, were accountability
and oversight provisions that normally accompany federal grants. Mazurak added
that the investigation of Fox has not altered the hospital's relationship with
DHA.

Mazurak said the hospital and the nonprofit have several other joint ventures,
including an asthmatic center in Greenville, a mental healthcare services and
educational programs for junior high school students.

Campbell wrote in his email that the two entities "continue to work together
collaboratively on EHRs to increase the access of healthcare and to improve the
quality of healthcare to patients in the Mississippi Delta."

Trillium gives $1.8 million to help clinics open to address needs of low-income
patients

BYLINE: Sherri Buri McDonald, The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1252 words


Dec. 13--It's been a long time coming, but all of the roughly 95,000 low-income
Lane County residents with Medicaid coverage through Trillium Community Health
Plan are set to have a primary care provider by the end of the year.

This was made possible by the recent addition of two local clinics, and $1.8
million in grants from Trillium to help finance the new clinics, which will
serve patients with various insurance plans, including Medicaid.

In early November, Lane County began treating patients at its newest Community
Health Center at Delta Oaks Shopping Center in north Eugene. It eventually will
accept 6,000 to 8,000 Trillium members of the Oregon Health Plan -- the state's
version of Medicaid.

Then, just a few days before Thanksgiving, Springfield Family Physicians opened
a clinic on Centennial Boulevard in Springfield. That clinic has taken on 8,000
Trillium Medicaid members, practice administrator Jane Conley said.

Trillium is one of 16 Coordinated Care Organizations, or CCOs, created by the
Legislature to deliver Medicaid services to Oregonians. Trillium awarded
Springfield Family Physicians a grant for $800,000 and gave Lane County $1
million for its new clinic.

"Access to care has been our No. 1 priority, and we certainly made the financial
investment," Trillium spokeswoman Debi Farr said.

"With the investments in the new clinics, there's more capacity," she said,
adding that this expanded ability to serve patients should help Trillium meet
future as well as current demand.

"That's additional capacity over and above the (members) we have assigned (to
providers)," Farr said. "If we were to lose providers for whatever reason, we
have capacity to serve additional members."

Trillium has struggled to find enough primary care providers for its Medicaid
members since the federal Affordable Care Act expanded eligibility for Medicaid
at the same time that Lane County faced a shortage of doctors, nurse
practitioners and physician assistants willing to care for them.

As a result of the expanded eligibility, Trillium received a flood of 13,000 new
Medicaid patients in February 2015. Eight months later, about 6,500 of them
still were without a primary care provider.

Trillium's struggle to find providers for patients was reflected in the state's
CCO performance measures last year. Trillium ranked last among the state's 16
CCOs for providing patient-centered primary care. However, Trillium's
performance on other measures was high enough to earn a performance bonus last
year.

The new county Community Health Center at Delta Oaks shopping center that opened
early last month immediately took on 4,000 Medicaid patients, and gradually will
add staff to serve 6,000 to 8,000 Medicaid patients, county spokesman Jason
Davis said.

The clinic leases 9,850 square feet of renovated retail space at Delta Oaks. It
is the county's sixth Community Health Care Center. The other clinics include
Charnelton Community in downtown Eugene; Brookside in west Eugene; Lane County
Behavioral Health Primary Care on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Eugene;
and Springfield Schools Health and River Stone in Springfield.

The new Delta Oaks clinic cost about $2.4 million, which was financed by the $1
million Trillium grant and $1.4 million through fee-for-service revenue
generated at the county's other clinics, Davis said.

Most of the services the county clinics provide are paid for by some form of
insurance. About 70 percent of patients have Medicaid, 11 percent have Medicare,
4 percent have commercial insurance plans, and about 15 percent are uninsured,
Davis said.

The Delta Oaks clinic opened in early November with one doctor and one nurse
practitioner as primary care providers, but by the spring it expects to have
three doctors, two nurse practitioners, one mental health clinician, one
community outreach worker, and 17 support staff, Davis said.

With the ongoing national shortage of primary care providers, it was a challenge
to recruit, he said. But the county zeroed in on candidates whose careers had
focused on serving communities and improving community health.

"It's yielded fantastic results," Davis said. "We brought in a medical doctor
from Missouri...and a nurse practitioner from California who (are) eager to do
this work."

Oregon's CCOs, which aim to improve health care quality and overall community
health while reducing costs, have attracted attention outside the state, and
that helps with recruitment, he said.

"The work that our CCOs are doing is being noticed, so there are providers more
and more who want to be part of that and want to be involved in (health care)
transformation," Davis said.

Springfield Family Physicians also has found job candidates who are interested
in being part of the reform effort underway in Oregon.

"We have a deep commitment to transforming primary care," said Conley, the
Springfield Family Physicians administrator. "There's a lot of pieces to that,
and we're very serious and dedicated to the transformation of care in our city
and our state. That helps energize the candidates when they take a look at our
practices."

Following a six-month search, Springfield Family Physicians hired five primary
care providers, for a total of 18 providers among its three locations.

The practice invested more than $2.5 million to buy and renovate the
10,000-square-foot clinic at 1800 Centennial Blvd., and to buy phones, computers
and equipment, Conley said.

The practice's other two sites are on Marcola Road in Springfield and at the
Center for Family Development in Eugene, where Springfield Family Physicians has
placed a physician assistant.

"We have embedded behavioral health at all of our sites," Conley said, so
behavioral health experts can work with patients on such issues as depression or
substance abuse, which affect patients' physical health.

"That's an attraction to primary care physicians because it's beginning to be
understood that that's necessary to providing full-service primary care," she
said.

Springfield Family Physicians recently hired a doctor who is retiring from the
U.S. Navy, who will lead the new Centennial Boulevard clinic. The practice hired
a health psychologist, who has training in physical health as well as training
in psychology, Conley said.

"Her interest is in how the mental wellness of patients affects chronic disease,
so we're excited about having her join us," Conley said.

The practice also has hired two nurse practitioners and a doctor. Those new
hires will work at the Marcola clinic, while two seasoned physician assistants
and one nurse practitioner will move from the Marcola clinic to the Centennial
clinic, Conley said.

The latter clinic's interior was designed with areas to facilitate communication
and collaboration among team members treating the same patient, she said.

Accepting 8,000 Medicaid patients has been both exciting and challenging, Conley
said.

"In general, people who've been without a doctor for a long time (are) very
complex," she said. "It may take a while and several visits to get to the bottom
of health issues that have been ignored for a long time. That's part of the
excitement of having embedded behavioral health and social services taking care
of patients in a deeper way and understanding the obstacles and challenges they
have in their lives."

Delta Dental of Tennessee Announces $300,000 in Grants to Tennessee Nonprofits
in December

LENGTH: 641  words


New Delhi, Dec. 22 -- In the spirit of giving during the holiday season, Delta
Dental of Tennessee announces seven grants to local nonprofits totaling
$300,000.

These grants are part of a larger initiative providing grants to organizations
that provide oral health care to children and those in need across the state.
Throughout 2011, Delta Dental has awarded more than 20 percent of its net
revenues to organizations, including both of the state's dental schools, The
University of Tennessee College of Dentistry and Meharry Medical College School
of Dentistry.

"Working to improve oral health in Tennessee is an important piece of the Delta
Dental mission," said Tom Perry, SVP and CFO for Delta Dental.

Seven grants totaling $300,000 will be given to a number of organizations across
the state. Delta Dental reached out to a number of legislative officials to help
identify worthy organizations in their respective districts. The first of these
grants was presented Dec. 22 at Remote Area Medical in Knoxville, which was
recommended by Representative John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-Tenn).

"Delta Dental is a great corporate citizen in our community and we were thrilled
to help them in their efforts to help improve the oral health of all
Tennesseans, especially those living in East Tennessee," said Representative
Duncan. "We are very familiar with the great work RAM has done in our area and
we know this grant will be put to good use in their 2012 missions."

"Due to the current economy, we have faced hardships with donations as well as
the fact that it is creating more need for our services," said Stan Brock,
founder of Remote Area Medical. "This gift from Delta Dental will help us be
able to meet those increasing needs with next year's expeditions."

* Remote Area Medical Foundation of Knoxville. The $50,000 grant will be used to
provide dental care and supplies. RAM was founded by Stan Brock, a co-host of
Wild Kingdom. The organization provides dental services to impoverished U.S.
populations. The organization's first medical expedition for 2012 is scheduled
for Feb. 4-5 in Knoxville, and more than 50 percent of all 2012 events scheduled
to-date will take place in Tennessee.

* Keystone Dental Care, Inc. of Johnson City, Tenn., was recommended by
Representative Phil Roe of Johnson City. The clinic's mission is to educate,
provide relief of dental pain and infection, to eliminate active disease and
stabilize oral health. The clinic, which will receive a $50,000 grant, provides
care to the working uninsured.

* HOPE for the Inner City in Chattanooga, a Christian social services
organization, will receive a $50,000 grant. For nearly 25 years, its Dr. William
Roy Mercy Dental Clinic has served people who are without insurance or without
access to basic dental care.

* Erlanger Foundation in Chattanooga will receive a $25,000 grant with funds
designated to Children's Hospital at Erlanger.

* Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt in Nashville will receive
$50,000 to purchase tools and equipment that will help aid in its dental clinic
and children's programs.

* St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis will receive $50,000 to
purchase tools and equipment that will help aid in its dental clinic and
children's programs.

* Children Are People of Hendersonville, Tenn., is located in Representative
Diane Black's 6th Congressional District. Children Are People, which will
receive a $25,000 grant, assists at-risk children in Sumner County by developing
academic and life skills to produce responsible, self-sufficient adults who
contribute to their community.

"Giving back to our community is an essential component of what we do at Delta
Dental, and it is especially important at this time. We are privileged to be
able to support community programs that help improve the oral health of the
areas we serve," Perry said.

Cancer Research magazine has published research conducted jointly by
InterGenetics and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation reporting that a
novel RNA molecule suppresses breast tumor growth in a mouse-model.

The InterGenetics' research team introduced a portion of the human Prohibitin
gene into breast cancer cells and showed that it functions as a tumor
suppressor.

"Our research indicated the expression of this novel RNA resulted in significant
suppression of tumor growth in the animal experiments," said Edlon Jupe, vice
president of research for the company. "These results specifically suggest
Prohibitin may represent a target therapeutic for tumors in humans. On a larger
scale this research highlights the value of technology identifying specific
genes that indicate a predisposition to cancer for other therapeutics."

"The ability to identify combinations of susceptibility genes for breast cancer
is the center of our work at InterGenetics," said Craig Shimasaki, president and
CEO. "This research indicates a clinical pathway in the future by which
physicians may be able to genetically target breast cancer treatments."

InterGenetics is an emerging Oklahoma-based biotech company specializing in
genetics-based cancer-risk assessment and cancer intervention.

Integris opens heart hospital

Integris Health has opened the Integris Heart Hospital at Integris Baptist
Medical Center. Described as a "hospital within a hospital," the facility houses
the most cardiac beds in the Oklahoma City area, along with the most cardiac
nurses and professional staff, said Anthony Long, president of Integris Heart
Hospital

Integris receives consumer honor

National Research Corp. has honored Integris Health with its 2002 Consumer
Choice Award, marking the eighth consecutive year Integris has received the
award.

Winners of the awards are health care systems and hospitals that consumers
choose as having the highest quality and image in more than 100 markets across
the nation.

Integris was the only health care system named for the awards in the Oklahoma
City area. Winners are determined by consumer perceptions on multiple quality
and image ratings.

Grants for isolation rooms

The Oklahoma State Department of Health has announced that it will make funds
available for grants to enhance isolation rooms in hospital emergency
departments in Oklahoma.

About $3 million will be made available through federal Health Resources and
Services Administration cooperative agreements. The effort is part of part of
the national push for "readiness" among hospitals and the health care system to
have facilities that can deal with mass casualty events.

This solicitation is the first of what may be two phases of grant fund
availability. The first will be to renovate, remodel or retrofit fixed hospital
isolation room structures. The second phase, if funds are made available, will
solicit proposals for portable isolation units.

More access to dental care

BYLINE: Mark Newman, Ottumwa Courier, Iowa

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 422 words


Sept. 26--OTTUMWA -- If you think there's too long a wait to get your  teeth
taken care of, River Hills Community Health Center has good news.

The new expansion has increased the number of patients that can be seen in their
dental department, and community leaders were at the Market Street location to
tour the new wing.

"Since I've been here, we've always been fully booked," said Dr. Ken Jones, the
dental director, who started in 2005.

They've added a dentist, bringing the staff to three dentists, as well as two
full-time and one part-time dental hygienists.

Suzanne Heckenliable, executive director of Delta Dental of Iowa Foundation,
said as a not-for-profit organization, Delta has a responsibility to assist with
social welfare.

"Their expansion can serve more people -- it addresses a need," she said. "In
community health centers, our goal is to help [many] Iowans, especially
under-served Iowans, [access] oral health care on a regular basis."

Her organization gave River Hills $92,000.

River Hills CEO Rick Johnson said that covered about half the cost of the
expansion.

"We had a nice space before," said Jones, "we just didn't have the capacity.
There are a lot of people looking for a dental home."

Johnson kicked off the dental department in 2005. When he was hired by the
board, they told him they wanted to provide needed care services to the
community.

He said just talking to the medical patients clued him in to the fact that many
of them had no dental care. And the federal government was encouraging community
health centers to branch out and provide more than just medical care.

When Johnson and the board said they were going to bring the community a dental
clinic that would accept private and government insurance, or a sliding scale
for those who are uninsured, they applied for a grant, received it. They also
said they would bring in an OB/GYN clinic and a behavioral health department:
Both are up and running.

In 2005, there were 21 employees. As of Tuesday, the clinic employed 125 people.

The board still encourages growth, Johnson said. The "need" he sees is in mental
health care.

"I think we could use another therapist, though they're hard to find. We're
adding tele-psychiatry to our behavioral health [department]. And we'd
eventually like to hire our own psychiatrists. What I'd really like is to hire a
child psychologist and an adult psychologist."

Recognize Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) for health care
research grants in Mississippi Delta.

LENGTH: 692  words

DATELINE: New York



 Jackson: Mississippi Legisature has issued the following Status of Senate Bill:




  A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE
SUPPORT GIVEN BY THE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH INSTITUTE (PCORI) FOR
HEALTHCARE OPTIONS TO PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA.





      WHEREAS, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), is an
independent nonprofit, nongovernmental organization located in Washington, D.C.,
that was authorized by Congress in 2010.  It was designed to improve the quality
and relevance of evidence available to help patients, caregivers, clinicians,
employers, insurers and policymakers make informed health decisions.
Specifically, it funds comparative clinical effectiveness research, or CER, as
well as supports work that will improve the methods used to conduct such
studies; and



      WHEREAS, patients, their families, and clinicians face a wide range of
complex and often confusing choices when it comes to addressing their health and
healthcare concerns.  They need trustworthy information to decide which option
is be for them.  Unfortunately, traditional medical research, for all of the
remarkable advances in health care it produces, has not been able to answer many
of the questions that patients and clinicians face daily.  Even when reliable
information does exist, it is not always available to patients, or those who
care for them, in ways they can understand or use most effectively; and



      WHEREAS, PCORI was established to help address these challenges.  Its job
is to close the gaps in evidence needed to improve key health concerns by
identifying critical research questions, funding patient-centered comparative
clinical effectiveness research, or CER, and disseminating the results in ways
that the end-users of our work will find useful and valuable.  For patients,
this strategy means providing information about which approaches to care might
work best, given their particular concerns, circumstances and preferences.  For
clinicians, it means focusing on providing evidence-based information about
questions they face daily in practice.  For insurers, it means producing
evidence that can help them make the best decisions on how to improve health
outcomes for their members.  For researchers, it means supporting studies
designed to build a much-needed base of useful evidence for improving outcomes
in high-burden, high-impact conditions; and



      WHEREAS, a family physician, clinical epidemiologist, and health services
researcher, PCORI Executive Director Joe Selby, M.D., MPH, has more than 35
years of experience in patient care, research and administration.  He is
responsible for identifying strategic issues and opportunities for PCORI and
implementing and  administering programs authorized by the PCORI Board of
Governors; and



      WHEREAS, the goal of PCORI work is to determine which of the many health
care options available to patients and those who care for them work best in
particular circumstances; and



      WHEREAS, it is with great pride that we pay tribute to the contributions
of this excellent corporate citizen in supporting healthcare in the Mississippi
Delta:



      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI,
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN, That we do hereby recognize the
outstanding financial and resource support given by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) for health care options to patients and
providers in the Mississippi Delta and extend our best wishes to the University
of Southern Mississippi and the Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation on the
occasion of the Mississippi Rural Delta PCORI Partnership Community Celebration
on April 4, 2017.



      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution be presented to the Executive
Director of PCORI, the President of the University of Southern Mississippi and
the Director of the Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation, and made available to
the Capitol Press Corps.

Recognize Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) for health care
research grants in Mississippi Delta.

LENGTH: 716  words

DATELINE: New York



 Jackson: Mississippi Legisature has issued the following Status of Senate Bill:




  MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE



 2017 Regular Session



 To: Rules



 By: Senator(s) Chassaniol

 Senate Concurrent Resolution 642

 (As Adopted by Senate)



 A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE
SUPPORT GIVEN BY THE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES RESEARCH INSTITUTE (PCORI) FOR
HEALTHCARE OPTIONS TO PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA.





      WHEREAS, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), is an
independent nonprofit, nongovernmental organization located in Washington, D.C.,
that was authorized by Congress in 2010.  It was designed to improve the quality
and relevance of evidence available to help patients, caregivers, clinicians,
employers, insurers and policymakers make informed health decisions.
Specifically, it funds comparative clinical effectiveness research, or CER, as
well as supports work that will improve the methods used to conduct such
studies; and



      WHEREAS, patients, their families, and clinicians face a wide range of
complex and often confusing choices when it comes to addressing their health and
healthcare concerns.  They need trustworthy information to decide which option
is be for them.  Unfortunately, traditional medical research, for all of the
remarkable advances in health care it produces, has not been able to answer many
of the questions that patients and clinicians face daily.  Even when reliable
information does exist, it is not always available to patients, or those who
care for them, in ways they can understand or use most effectively; and



      WHEREAS, PCORI was established to help address these challenges.  Its job
is to close the gaps in evidence needed to improve key health concerns by
identifying critical research questions, funding patient-centered comparative
clinical effectiveness research, or CER, and disseminating the results in ways
that the end-users of our work will find useful and valuable.  For patients,
this strategy means providing information about which approaches to care might
work best, given their particular concerns, circumstances and preferences.  For
clinicians, it means focusing on providing evidence-based information about
questions they face daily in practice.  For insurers, it means producing
evidence that can help them make the best decisions on how to improve health
outcomes for their members.  For researchers, it means supporting studies
designed to build a much-needed base of useful evidence for improving outcomes
in high-burden, high-impact conditions; and



      WHEREAS, a family physician, clinical epidemiologist, and health services
researcher, PCORI Executive Director Joe Selby, M.D., MPH, has more than 35
years of experience in patient care, research and administration.  He is
responsible for identifying strategic issues and opportunities for PCORI and
implementing and  administering programs authorized by the PCORI Board of
Governors; and



      WHEREAS, the goal of PCORI work is to determine which of the many health
care options available to patients and those who care for them work best in
particular circumstances; and



      WHEREAS, it is with great pride that we pay tribute to the contributions
of this excellent corporate citizen in supporting healthcare in the Mississippi
Delta:



      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI,
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING THEREIN, That we do hereby recognize the
outstanding financial and resource support given by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) for health care options to patients and
providers in the Mississippi Delta and extend our best wishes to the University
of Southern Mississippi and the Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation on the
occasion of the Mississippi Rural Delta PCORI Partnership Community Celebration
on April 4, 2017.



      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this resolution be presented to the Executive
Director of PCORI, the President of the University of Southern Mississippi and
the Director of the Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation, and made available to
the Capitol Press Corps.

'There's More Than Oil Spillage Affecting the Niger Delta' [interview]

BYLINE: Adie Vanessa Offiong

LENGTH: 1503 words


is the brain behind award-winning documentary, 'Daughters of the Niger Delta and
Programme Director of Media Informative Narrative Development (MIND)'.
Preferring to operate from behind the scenes, she spoke to Sunday Trust on the
motivation for her film, the journey bringing it to fruition and the impacts she
hopes it will have amongst other issues.

I came to Nigeria in 2004 and fell in love - not just with my husband but also
with the country. Before I left the Netherlands, I had worked for 6 years as a
researcher in various Dutch universities. I loved analyzing social reality
(specializations: international relations and gender studies).

But I wanted to do something more change-driven than the mere production of
academic knowledge. I'm very happy to have found work in which I can focus on my
passion: development communication. My other passions are my husband and our
4-year old daughter.

The idea grew during one of MIND's first projects called FEMSCRIPT (funded by
Cordaid and the Netherlands Embassy in Abuja). We trained a group of young women
from the Niger Delta in gender and human rights. Based on research in their own
communities, they each made a short film about one issue that they considered
key for promoting women's advancement in their own home towns. About these
chosen topics they jointly produced nine short films:

· Access to Health Care: Tuomo (Bayelsa State) & Olomoro (Delta State)

· Women's Work Load: Akassa (Bayelsa State) & Patani (Delta State)

· Rights of Widows: Amassoma (Bayelsa State) & Bodo-City (Rivers State)

· Access to Water: Obiaruku (Delta State)

· Right to Education: Belema-Polo (Rivers State)

· Environmental Pollution: Bonny (Rivers State)

The movies were produced for local advocacy purposes, but the messages seemed
important enough to be shared with a wider audience. Thanks to a grant from the
German Embassy we were able to collect additional footage and produced
'Daughters of the Niger Delta'.

Our film tells a different story about the Niger Delta than the usual media
reports about oil outputs, conflict, and kidnapping. It gives a taste of
everyday life in the region through the eyes of three ordinary women: Hannah,
Naomi, and Rebecca. Through their personal stories we learn that the oil and gas
pollution in their backyard is not the only human rights violation affecting
their lives.

'Daughters of the Niger Delta' is a bottom-up film production. Rather than
bringing in external filmmakers to document the lives of women, young women from
the heart of the region were equipped with the tools and skills to do so
themselves. They were trained in filmmaking as part of a MIND capacity building
program entitled FEMSCRIPT.

The aim was to give local women control over the information and images produced
out about them, enabling them to say in their own words what matters to them. We
felt this is extremely important in the Niger Delta context, where lots of
people claim to be fighting on behalf of the Niger Delta people while merely
filling their own pockets.

MIND believes that lots of important lessons can be learned from the Niger Delta
- lessons that also apply to other regions in Nigeria that are currently marred
by violence. In 2009, the Nigerian president granted amnesty to armed local
groups claiming to fight for the environmental and social rights of the Niger
Delta people. The amnesty deal and follow-up measures helped to temporarily
reduce the much-reported violence and kidnappings in the region. But it didn't
lessen the price that local people have to pay for the oil and gas extracted
from their backyard.

Moreover, the initiatives inadequately acknowledge the post-conflict recovery
needs of those who did not take active part in the violence.

Though important first steps, amnesty and DRR (disarmament, rehabilitation, and
reintegration of the armed local groups) do not help to resolve the root causes
of the social tensions in the region. The government's peace efforts are
unlikely to bring sustainable peace as long as they merely address the symptoms
of the Niger Delta crisis (banning/reducing armed violence). There is an urgent
need for stabilization efforts to move beyond 'violence control' and adopt a
more holistic approach of 'safeguarding human rights' that also tackles the
underlying causes of the social tensions (including environmental pollution,
inadequate standards of living, and lacking economic development across the
region). 'Daughters of the Niger Delta' sheds light on these underlying causes.

Addressing these underlying issues is becoming more and more important in view
of the fast-approaching closure of the government's Amnesty Programme in 2015.
The fragile peace in the region may not be sustained if no serious work is made
of protecting people's rights to food, water, and a healthy living environment.

Enhancing women's participation in decision-making might help to set issues on
the public agenda that currently are not prioritised - including water supply,
health care and economic development. These priorities can help to enhance
people's standards of living across communities. Common interests like these are
more likely to contribute to sustained peace in the region than the individual
settlement claims fuelled by today's Amnesty Program.

Women activists who have fought for decades side-by-side men for eliminating the
oil and gas pollution in the Niger Delta, often feel painfully unsupported by
their male peers when it comes to overthrowing traditional practices that
undermine women's human rights. "Let us resolve the big issues first, and then
we'll come to women's problems", is an often-heard response.

Rather than setting aside gender as a matter of secondary importance, 'Daughters
of the Niger Delta' shows how gender is intrinsically interwoven with mainstream
current affairs in the region. Women are hit hardest by the environmental
pollution in their backyard. They suffer most directly from the inadequate
public service delivery in their communities. And their rights are further
undermined by exclusionary gender practices.

However, women are not just victims. They are the main engines keeping a
somewhat normal economy of provisions going in the vastly impoverished Niger
Delta. They provide most of the food for their families. They invest in their
children's health and education. And they do everything they can to enhance
their children's prospects in life. They could be powerful catalysts for
development - if only they were empowered to thrive.

Women are the main engines keeping a somewhat normal economy of provisions going
in impoverished and conflict-marred Niger Delta communities. They organize
peaceful protests uniting women across the region. They mediate behind the
scenes to prevent community clashes between elders, youth, and other parties.
And they do everything they can to create better future prospects for their
children. Tapping into these potentials of women and empowering them to
participate in peace-process negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction can
help to catapult development in the region.

We aim to draw public attention to 'simmering injustices' in Nigerian society.
These injustices do not just take place in the Niger Delta, but also in other
part so the country. We want to bring to the fore things that we don't hear
about in the news because they happen every day: children who die because
there's no medical aid, widows who are deprived of their household properties
and can't feed their children, women whose bodies are bending daily under heavy
water loads because of failing public service delivery. The world seems to take
these injustices for granted. The media don't regard them 'newsworthy' as
they're considered 'normal' parts of life.

Yet if we look at the death toll, these 'simmering injustices' actually are much
more destructive than the much-reported armed violence and kidnappings in the
Niger Delta. Statistics suggest that every year, one out of every seven children
below the age of 5 die. That's over 65000 children in the three core Niger Delta
states alone! We rarely hear about these deaths in the news. But each of these
65.000 children is a human being, just like you and me. How come we shrug their
deaths off so easily? 'Daughters of the Niger Delta' seeks to give these
'simmering injustices a human face.

Hopefully, this will turn out to be a more constructive way of drawing attention
to the Niger Delta issues than violence and kidnapping.

The selection of the filmmaking trainees was a highly competitive process. We
publicly announced the traineeship vacancy and the response was overwhelming.
Criteria that were decisive for the final selection of the 9 trainees included
the drive/motivation displayed in application letters and interviews,
performance in writing skill test, graduation papers, and 3rd party
recommendations. MIND regretfully had to turn down many great candidates, but
the nine trainees who made it through the competitive selection procedure turned
out to be a winning team.

New Rochester dental office gets $1 million grant

BYLINE: Brett Boese, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 537 words


Nov. 03--The project was already moving forward, but Community Dental Care got a
jolt of good news last month.

Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation recently announced that it approved a $1
million grant to support the new 18-chair dental clinic that's being constructed
just off U.S. Highway 14 in Southeast Rochester. A ceremonial groundbreaking
attended by dozens of local dignitaries, including Rochester Mayor Ardell Brede,
was held Sept. 14.

The city previously approved a $2.25 million loan to help fund the $3.9 million
project. Fundraising is underway to fill the remaining funding gap with the
expectation of opening the facility next fall. Nine of the 18 chairs are
expected to be operational when it opens.

"We are so happy to support this project, which will bring accessible dental
care to an area of the state that has demonstrated a significant need, and to do
so with a partner who has a proven record of meeting those needs," said Joe
Lally, executive director of Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation. "We know that
oral health is key to overall health, and we believe that every single person
deserves a healthy smile. This new clinic will make a substantial impact for
thousands of Minnesotans who otherwise would not have access to quality care."

Community Dental Care is currently operating a six-chair dental facility out of
a small space on Rochester Community and Technical College's campus to fill "a
significant, unmet need for oral health care in southeastern Minnesota." That
site has a two-month waiting list for dental appointments and a seven-month
waiting list to see a hygienist.

According to data provided by Community Dental Care, around 70 percent of the
71,000 residents in and around Olmsted County eligible for public programs did
not receive care. Just 43 percent of the 10,000 Medicaid-eligible children
visited a dentist.

The new facility is expected to create up to 35 full-time jobs while providing
primary dental care to about 10,000 people annually. The targeted audience is
low-income families and those living in poverty, who might otherwise not be able
to afford dental care. Programming at the clinic will include preventative
education for families.

"The need for dental services in Rochester and our surrounding communities is
enormous," said Dr. Vacharee Peterson, CEO of Community Dental Care. "Too many
people are going without even a simple exam, which can prevent the need for
serious or emergency dental procedures in the future. This new clinic will
transform dental care access for thousands of these children and families in
need. We are grateful for the support and the trust from Delta Dental of
Minnesota Foundation."

Community Dental Care is one of the largest nonprofit dental clinics in the
state, operating facilities in St. Paul, Maplewood, Robbinsdale and Rochester.
It cared fir more than 43,000 patients in 2015.

Since 2011, Delta Dental has invested more than $21 million in grants across the
state to help improve care and promote dental health.

Delta Dental Awards $10,000 Grant to Miami Children's Hospital Dental Program

LENGTH: 210  words


New Delhi, Nov. 25 -- Delta Dental Insurance Company today awarded a $10,000
grant to Miami Children's Hospital Foundation to help fund its dental program.



The dental program provides dental care and education to children throughout the
community, including underserved areas. To date, the dental program has served
more than 100,000 children and adolescents in Miami-Dade County.

"This program aligns with Delta Dental's corporate mission to increase access to
dental care for the underserved," said John Yamamoto, DDS, Delta Dental's vice
president of Professional Services. "We're very pleased that we can help support
this important effort by Miami Children's Hospital to improve children's oral
health."

Serving an estimated 17,000 children per year, the program provides oral health
screenings, assessments and exams, fluoride varnish/dental sealants, cleanings,
education on healthy eating habits and oral hygiene to screened children and
oral health education to parents/caregivers regarding the child's (or
children's) needs.

"We are truly grateful to our corporate partners like Delta Dental for their
unwavering support of the children and families we serve year-round," said Lucy
Morillo-Agnetti, president and CEO of Miami Children's Hospital Foundation.

New clinic is homecoming for Woodlake MD;
Kaweah Delta Health Care District hires WHS grad Rocio Medina, MD to be primary
physician at new clinic in the former Woodlake Family Health Clinic

BYLINE: The Foothills Sun-Gazette staff

LENGTH: 767  words


Since she was a young girl translating for her parents, Rocio Medina knew the
importance of having a medical clinic in her hometown of Woodlake. After an
instructor at Woodlake High School piqued her interest in biology, she decided
to volunteer her time at the Woodlake Family Health Clinic.

"Growing up I got an understanding that there were not many physicians in the
valley who were Latino or spoke Spanish," Medina said. "That really left an
impression on me."

On Jan. 11, Medina returned to the clinic as its primary physician to see
patients for the first time since the clinic was shut down in April and reopened
by Kaweah Delta Health Care District. Woodlake Health Clinic offers family
medicine, women's health and pediatrics to patients at 180 E. Antelope Ave. The
clinic is 4,200 square feet with eight exam rooms and is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on weekdays.

"Being from a migrant farm worker family, 1 always felt that people should
receive quality health care whether or not they had insurance," she said.

After graduating from WHS in 1998, Medina went on to graduate from the
University of California, Davis with bachelor's in cell biology, a medical
degree from UC San Francisco and then completed her residency in internal
medicine from Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar, Calif. It was there that
she met her husband Antonio Manquero, who happened to be from Cutler.

"I knew at some point that I was going to come back to the valley. This is
home," said Medina, who was already spending more weekends in Wood-lake than
Southern California to spend time with nieces and nephews. "I always felt like I
could really help out the community."

In 2010, Medina had the choice of taking a position in Colorado or Tulare and
couldn't pass up the opportunity to be near home. Now married and ready to
welcome her first child, Medina said it made sense to settle in Tulare County
and transition toward practicing in an outpatient setting such as the Woodlake
Health Clinic.

"So many patients have told us how happy they are to see familiar faces," she
said. "I am so excited to be here and I think the community is excited to have
us here."

Dave Garrett, director of the Rural Health Clinic for Kaweah Delta, said the
clinic received approval from the California Department of Public Health on Jan.
11 at about 3 p.m. and saw its first patients at about 3:30 p.m. that same
afternoon.

"Five out of the six team members we have here are Woodlake High School
graduates and the entire staff is bilingual," Garrett said. "I think each
community has its own culture and the more we can support that the better."

Garrett said Woodlake Family Health Center closed in May of last year due to
state funding cuts that reduced the clinic's grant funding by $270,000 in a
single year. Garrett said Walter Reed, the center's administrator for nearly 30
years, donated all of the medical and office equipment to KDDH in order to
reopen the facility for the community. In the meantime, KDDH replaced the
flooring, upgraded the computer system, repainted and renovated the facility
before reopening last week.

"I think it is great to see so many Tigers returning to Wood-lake," Garrett
said.

In addition to its clinic in Woodlake, Kaweah Delta operates rural health
clinics in Exeter and Lindsay. The Woodlake Health Clinic is also a homecoming
for Alma Correra, a physician's assistant, who lived in Woodlake for about six
years from 1984-1988. Correra said her son graduated from WHS but that she knows
many of the patients after working at the KDDH's Exeter Health Clinic for the
past six months.

"While the Woodlake clinic was closed, many of the patients came to Exeter,"
said Correra, also a UC Davis graduate. "I see many of those same people coming
here now."

Kaweah Delta Exeter Health Clinic is open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday-Thursday;
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays; 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays; and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
on Sundays at 1014 San Juan Ave., Exeter. Kaweah Delta Lindsay Health Clinic is
open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday at 839 N. Sequoia Ave.

Kaweah Delta Health Care District is one of the area's most progressive health
care providers. In 2011, it was named the only facility with Magnet status in
the San Joaquin Valley serving children and adults and remains the only level
III trauma center serving Tulare and Kings counties.

The district offers a comprehensive scope of services including everything from
a well-respected pediatric hospi-talist program to a nationally recognized
cancer program. For more information, visit www.kaweahdelta.org or follow Kaweah
Delta on Twitter and Facebook.

Dental price-fixing scheme uncovered U.S.: Insurer conspired to eliminate
discounts

BYLINE: Aaron Epstein, Knight-Ridder News Service

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A-11

LENGTH: 449 words


WASHINGTON - Suddenly, many patients in Arizona found that they could no longer
get their teeth fixed at low prices. Their discounts had disappeared.

If they needed a crown to replace a decayed tooth, they had to pay $ 575. The
vanished discount price had been $ 250.

What happened, government investigators learned, was that the dominant dental
insurer had vigorously enforced a clause that had the effect of curbing
discounts that saved dental patients $ 6 million to $ 10 million a year.

But yesterday, the Justice Department joined the Arizona attorney general in
announcing precedent-setting action that stopped the price-fixing scheme.

Similar schemes are becoming increasingly common in the nation's health-care
industry, said Anne Bingaman, the Justice Department's chief enforcer of federal
antitrust laws.

Bingaman warned the industry that investigators are "looking hard" at such
schemes because they are "costing consumers and    driving up the cost of health
care."

Five price-fixing arrangements are under federal investigation, Bingaman said.
She refused to identify them.

The investigations are aimed at health-care agreements that contain so-called
"most favored nation" clauses. Modeled after their counterparts in foreign
trade, they require a doctor, dentist or hospital to charge covered patients the
lowest price available to any other patient.

The clause could bring prices down. But this is what the government said
happened in Arizona:

Faced with growing competition, the state's dominant dental insurer, Delta
Dental Plan of Arizona, required its participating dentists - 85 percent of all
dentists in the state - not to charge Delta-covered patients any more than they
charged under competing discount plans.

But the dentists, who derived a huge chunk of their income from Delta patients,
chose not to lower fees to those patients. Instead, the dentists resigned from
the discount plans.

The mass exodus threatened to put competitors out of business - and resulted in
higher prices to consumers.

People living on fixed incomes in smaller communities suffered most, said
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods.

In its original complaint, the Justice Department and the Arizona attorney
general charged that Delta, which is controlled by dentists, conspired to
eliminate discount fees offered by competitors and coerced dentists into
dropping out of competing dental plans.

Delta Dental, part of a nationwide network of dental insurers, denied any
wrongdoing. But under terms of a non-criminal settlement filed in federal court,
Delta agreed to send letters to all its participating dentists declaring the
most favored nation clause to be void.

Grant Delta HIV/Aids Committee Agency Status, CSO Urges Okowa

BYLINE: Omon-Julius Onabu

LENGTH: 296 words

DATELINE: Asaba


An appeal has gone to the Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, to grant the
Delta State Action Committee on HIV/AIDS (DELSACA) an "agency status" without
further delay so as to enhance the ability of the body to impact more on the
lives of the people of the state through its activities.

Faith Nwadishi, Executive Director, Koyenum Immalah Foundation (KIF), a civil
society organisation, made the appeal at the second media and legislative
roundtable on DELSACA/World Bank HIV/AIDS Programme Development Project II,
organized by KIF at Asaba, Delta State.

Once it becomes an agency, DELSACA would be in a better position to pursue its
primary responsibility of promoting programmes and projects that would
drastically reduce the level people infected with HIV/AIDS in the state as the
body would then enjoy wider confidence and collaboration with local and
international organisations.

Nwadishi said, "We want to draw the attention of the Delta State Government to
the need to urgently make DELSACA an agency as Delta State is today the only
state in the federation yet to accord this vital Public Health Service provider
such befitting status."

She also urged the state government not only to continue its free healthcare
programme but to take a step further by ensuring "appropriate legislation on,
and continuation of, the Free Maternal and Under-Five healthcare schemes of the
Delta State Government."

"Most community women that patronise maternity homes complained that only people
who went to general or general hospitals actually benefited from the state
government's free Maternal Medicare and even the Under-five healthcare
schemes.", Nwadishi said, noting that giving the schemes appropriate legal
muscle would correct any imbalance in the laudable healthcare programme.

Mental health workers in demand

BYLINE: Zachary K. Johnson, The Record, Stockton, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 920 words


July 28--STOCKTON -- Officials say the new prison health care facility on the
edge of Stockton has already siphoned away a significant number of county mental
health workers.

So far, Behavioral Health Services has lost about one-fifth of its psychiatric
technicians to the California Health Care Facility, an $839 million operation
that houses more than 1,700 sick or mentally ill state prisoners.

County officials embrace the facility and the 2,400 new, permanent jobs it is
expected to create, but they recognize they are competing for a shared and
limited pool of mental health workers. A legal settlement spawned a concerted
effort from the state, county and San Joaquin Delta College to quickly certify
hundreds of new "psych techs" to prevent a shortage.

"All of that was going according to plan," county Behavioral Health Services
Director Vic Singh said. "But even a good plan can't anticipate everything."

But the loss of psych techs was greater and happened sooner than expected.
Services haven't suffered, but the county is spending more on overtime. Whether
the shortage is a temporary blip or something that would prompt the county to
consider scaling back its 24/7 crisis readiness depends on how successfully the
county can recruit new workers, then not lose them to higher-paying jobs at the
state facility.

Among other things, psych techs can give medication and are trained to recognize
and document psychiatric symptoms, according to the county. The salary for
county psych techs ranges from $41,000 to $50,000 a year. The same position at
the prison facility ranges from $56,000 to $65,000.

Singh said the hope was that transfers from other state facilities and new psych
techs from Delta would fill slots at the new facility and lessen the impact on
the county, he said. But the sheer size of the new facility all but guaranteed
there would be some local impact, he said.

County Mental Health has lost 10 of its 50 psych techs, he said. The California
Health Care facility is jointly operated by the Department of Corrections and
Rehabilitation, California Correctional Health Care Services and the Department
of State Hospitals.

So far, the Department of State Hospitals has filled 140 of the 426 psych tech
and 40 senior psych tech positions expected at the facility, department
spokesman Ralph Montano said. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation
is expected to hire 80 psych techs for a unit that has yet to open.

Of the 140 hired, 25 came from other state hospitals, and an additional 13
transfers are expected, according to the Department of State Hospitals. It was
unclear how many came from other state agencies.

Representatives from the county and the state talked about psych techs at a
meeting Wednesday. "We understand that other facilities or programs in the
region may experience temporary shortages," Stirling Price, executive director
of the Department of State Hospitals-Stockton said in an emailed statement. "DSH
is examining ways to mediate these issues and still meet our important staffing
needs at DSH-Stockton."

Plans to build the state facility began when a federal judge found the health
care available to state prisoners fell short of constitutional standards.
Initially met with stiff opposition, the facility has been embraced by local
officials following a legal settlement reached in 2010 after Stockton and San
Joaquin County joined a lawsuit brought by the Greater Stockton Chamber of
Commerce. The wide-ranging settlement arranged everything from money to improve
infrastructure to local-hiring incentives during construction to efforts to help
locals get permanent jobs.

It paid to build a secure unit at San Joaquin General Hospital that has already
proved to be a money-spinner for the county hospital, where officials expect it
will continue to handle prisoner patients.

And it called for the facility to work with San Joaquin Delta College to train
licensed workers, including psych techs, who would be working at the facility.
The state paid $1.3 million toward the program, which then added a $1.5 million
federal grant. It is expected to train 270 through 2014. After that, it would
handle 40 students a year.

But there just wasn't enough time for the Delta program to prevent the shortfall
at the county, Health Services Director Ken Cohen said. In addition to the loss
of mental health psych techs, the county lost three of the seven positions who
screen inmates at the County Jail, he said.

That screening is a vital role that can help prevent fights, suicides and
assaults on correctional officers, said John Huber, both the former assistant
sheriff in charge of the San Joaquin County Jail and a member of the new
facility's Citizens' Advisory Committee. The Delta program will help provide
trained psych techs for the county, he said. "It's going to take a while to
catch up, ... but I think it will."

The Delta program allows residents to stay in the county to earn the
certification for a good local job, whether it's with the state or the county,
he said.

The facility is expected to be full and fully staffed by the end of the year.

It does not include the Dewitt Nelson Correctional Annex next door, a 1,133-bed
facility for inmates needing psychiatric care scheduled to be completed in 2014.

ORONO, Maine -- Many families hesitate to discuss and plan ahead for future
dependency of aging parents. Most people want to remain in their homes. Family
members who become caregivers need respite. Is your family prepared for this
challenge?


There will be a workshop open to the public titled "Family Planning for Late
Life" from 10 a.m. to noon Saturday, May 3, at Dirigo Pines Inn. Stan Freeman
will facilitate peer group discussion of family caregiving roles and housing
options for elders. Enrollment is limited to 20. There is a $5 fee for
materials.

BAR HARBOR, Maine -- The Chordoma Foundation has given a seed grant of $75,000
to Adrienne Flanagan, M.D., Ph.D., of University College, London, and her
Jackson Laboratory collaborator, Mike Sasner, Ph.D., to develop a new mouse
model for chordoma, a difficult-to-treat bone cancer affecting the skull and
spine.


Flanagan discovered that 97 percent of chordoma patients have an inherited
change in a gene called brachyury. She hypothesized that this change may lead to
the development of benign notochordal cell tumors, believed to be the precursor
to chordoma, according to a recent press release.


The funding will allow Flanagan to test this theory by collaborating with Sasner
and his Jackson Laboratory colleagues to develop a genetically engineered mouse
with the same genetic change, a potentially critical first step in developing a
genetic mouse model of chordoma.


The mice that are generated through this project will be made available to
academic and industry scientists through The Jackson Laboratory's repository.


The Jackson Laboratory is an independent, nonprofit biomedical research
institution based in Bar Harbor, with a facility in Sacramento, Calif., and the
new genomic medicine institute in Farmington, Conn.Dental Clinic returns after
yearlong absence


The New York University College of Dentist Medicine Henry Schein Cares Global
Student Outreach Clinic will be returning to Machias the week of April 14.


More than 4,600 dental appointments were provided for children and adults during
the program's first three years.


The program has been in Machias each spring and fall to provide no-cost dental
care. Last year there was no fall clinic for a couple of reasons, primarily
because it has been so successful. From the beginning the goal was to reduce
tooth decay among children, which has happened.


Hundreds of children have received comprehensive dental services to restore
teeth affected by cavities. The reduction in tooth decay also is thanks to
continued preventative efforts by the "Tooth Ferry" mobile dental van, operated
by Washington County Children's Program, a division of United Cerebral Palsy. It
provides fluoride and sealants for schools and Head Start programs to give out
between the NYUCD visits.


Finances also were a consideration in reducing the number of dental outreach
clinics to one a year. To offer care to adults and children for one week through
the program costs more than $50,000. The program was initiated through a grant
from Northeast Delta Dental Foundation and Delta Dental Plan of Maine, and has
been sustained primarily through providing care to children.


Due to limitations on MaineCare dental coverage for adults, the program is not
financially sustainable in caring for both adults and children. Delta Dental
Plan of Maine and the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation have been lead
contributors to the program to support NYUCD's ability to offer care at no cost
to patients.


"We are thrilled with how successful this collaborative program has been in
reducing oral disease in children, raising awareness or oral health, and
increasing access to dental care in Washington County," Kathleen B. Walker,
treasurer of the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation, said in a recent press
release.


The clinic will be held April 14-16, 18 and 19, at the Lee Pellon Event Center,
90 Main St., and is open to anyone having trouble accessing dental care. It is
not meant to replace regular care they already are receiving. Services are
provided at no cost but insurance, including MaineCare, will be accepted when
it's available. Complete care is available for children. Adults are seen for
emergency care on a walk-in basis.


The dental clinic is made possible by Delta Dental of Maine, Northeast Delta
Dental Foundation and Henry Schein Cares. The partners involved in the planning
and implementation include NYU College of Dentistry, Caring Hands of Maine,
Washington County Children's Program -- a division of United Cerebral Palsy,
Washington Hancock Community Agency and Child and Family Opportunities.

BRIEFLY: U.S. MEDICAID PLAN ADVANCES

BYLINE: COX NEWS SERVICE; NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE; REUTER; AP

LENGTH: 487 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


U.S. governors agreed Monday on a bipartisan plan for restructuring Medicaid and
appeared close to agreements to reform welfare and federal jobs programs, major
stumbling blocks in negotiations on the federal budget.

Under the Medicaid plan, each state would receive a lump sum of federal money,
known as a block grant, to finance health care for the poor.

But the plan would guarantee a package of medical benefits, to be defined in
federal law, to millions of poor people.

Clinton budget deal rejected

WASHINGTON -- With the federal budget for the current year still far from
settled, President Bill Clinton on Monday proposed a $ 1.64 trillion spending
plan for 1997, sketching how he would balance the budget in seven years with a
small tax cut.

But the Republican-controlled Congress has already dismissed the plan as
inadequate. The outline, issued to comply with a legal deadline, included
virtually no new proposals from the last offer Clinton made to the Republicans.

New York Times News Service

O.J. Simpson suspects drug link

LOS ANGELES -- O.J. Simpson said in a surprise call to a live television program
Monday he has "no doubt whatsoever" the murder of his ex-wife was linked to the
drug problems of her friend Faye Resnick.

Simpson's statement on CNN's show Burden of Proof was consistent with his
defence team's theory Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman may have been
killed by drug dealers seeking revenge against Resnick. He was acquitted of the
killings last year.

Jetiiner slides off icy runway

PORTLAND, Ore. -- A Delta Air Lines passenger jet slid off icy pavement early
Monday at Portland International Airport, closing a runway and delaying or
cancelling a number of flights.

Flight 1718 originated in Vancouver and was preparing to leave for Atlanta when
the mishap occurred. No one was hurt when the Boeing 757, carrying 79 passengers
and a crew of seven, slid into the grass beside a runway about 1:30 a.m., Delta
said.

Chinese terrified by aftershocks

BEIJING -- Hundreds of aftershocks jolted terrified villagers who endured
freezing weather rather than enter damaged homes in southwestern China, where an
earthquake killed about 250 people and injured 15,000.

Authorities said Monday they feared the death toll could rise to more than 300
in the Lijiang region as officials raced to airlift quilts, tents and medicine
to hundreds of thousands of people left homeless by Saturday's quake.

General strike called in Pakistan

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan was hit Monday by a general strike to support a
separatist revolt in the Indian-ruled part of the disputed Himalayan region of
Kashmir.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Sunday that Pakistan is ready for talks with
India to settle their longstanding dispute over Kashmir but declared it would
not be intimidated.

New program offers medical and dental checkups

BYLINE: David Olinger

SECTION: DTW; Pg. 4B

LENGTH: 622 words


Nathan Martinez is an unusual 9 year old boy. He actually likes dental care. So
he showed no fear at an appointment this month. He calmly walked into a
hygienist's office wearing a red shirt that declared, "You just be yourself and
I'll be awesome," and plopped onto her reclining chair with a smile.

What was really unusual, though, was the location. Nathan came down the hall for
dental treatment immediately after a physical checkup.

He is one of more than 4,000 patients seen this year in a program that the Delta
Dental Foundation calls unique in scope.

It has committed $3.3 million over five years to open 16 dental offices in
Colorado that team up with medical doctors to provide a broader range of health
care in a single location. All have hygienists who can refer patients to a
dentist. Some also have a dentist on site.

Nathan got his physical and a dental appointment at Doctors Care, a Littleton
clinic that has been helping low income families for 27 years.

Dental care has become the fourth prong among Doctors Care programs that also
provide medical, mental health and social work services.

"If you don't have heat, it's hard for me to talk about your diabetes," said
Bebe Kleinman, the clinic's chief executive officer.

Delta Dental launched its Colorado medical dental integration project with the
knowledge that many preschool children never see a dentist and the hope that
early intervention at medical clinics will reduce long term pains and costs.

Across the state, dental care shortages abound.

Eight of Colorado's 64 counties have been classified as dental deserts, with no
dentists or community based dental clinics.

Poor families face an extra barrier. According to the Colorado Health Institute,
only one third of practicing dentists treated Medicaid patients in fiscal 2013
14, and 5 percent of those dentists treated nearly half the clients.

Doctors Care doesn't have a dentist. But it now employs Doreen Swatloski, a
registered dental hygienist who cleans teeth and looks for problems.

"If we see dark spots, then we'll go ahead and refer them to a dentist," she
said.

Nathan's teeth look good. "I am happy to see that," Swatloski said. "Do you
brush them morning and night?"

"Yes," he said without hesitation.

Modern dental hygiene involves more than twice a year cleanings. During his
visit, Nathan also got a sealant that will help protect his molars from cavities
for 15 years.

As he lay in Swatloski's chair, she placed rose colored glasses over his eyes to
protect them from a bright overhead light.

"I'm preparing the teeth for sealant right now," she announced. "Roll your head
to me a little bit and open your mouth big, like an alligator."

He complied, sticking his tongue out only to fight off the sealant's plastic
taste.

Minutes later, his teeth wore a durable protective coat.

Swatloski pronounced him awesome. "No more plastic," she said.

The first phase of Delta Dental's grant program opened dental offices at health
centers mostly in the Denver area. The second will spread dental integration to
health care sites from La Junta to Grand Junction.

Allison Cusick, program officer for Delta Dental of Colorado Foundation, said
the response from people offered a new service at health clinics has been
rewarding so far.

"This is so brand new," she said. "We didn't know what to expect."

First Health Careers Academy class tosses the tassel

BYLINE: Nick Filipas, The Record, Stockton, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 670 words


June 06--STOCKTON -- When Health Careers Academy first opened its doors in 2011,
Principal Traci Miller had a freshman class of about 150 kids with a new
blueprint.

It was a school born out of need, spawned just after the announcement that more
prisons would be built in Stockton and would need a force of health care workers
to attend to the inmates expected to be transferred there from other prisons in
the state. California Correctional Health Care Services helped with the
establishment of the school by presenting a $700,000 grant to Stockton Unified.

The new prison facility opened in 2013 off Arch Airport Road and on Friday, just
two years later at Delta College's Atherton Theater, 105 students who first took
a chance at that opportunity are closer to obtaining some of those jobs.

"It was like the district handed me the keys and said 'go build a school,' "
Miller said.

She had to recruit prospective students at K-8 schools at Stockton Unified,
sharing the hopes and the dream of training these students to be ready for work
in the health care industry.

Her students are enriched in a school that closely resembles that of the medical
field. Hallways are called "units," class periods are called "rounds."

Students don medical scrubs and white jackets, just like ones they will
eventually wear in their chosen fields.

Friday night, a slideshow profiling each student listed off their most proud
accomplishments, career goals and where they will get their next education:
UCLA, UC Davis, Chico State, UC Santa Barbara, University of the Pacific, Delta
and the list goes on and on.

Those new graduates will continue to work in the medical office, becoming not
only nurses, doctors and physical therapists, but ultrasound technicians or
paramedics, or seek careers in dental fields or the military.

For Miller, it's a bittersweet but exciting moment in the school's young
history.

"You are at the end of one part of your journey, but you are at the beginning of
your destiny," Miller said in her opening speech, "I am confident that the
students from the first graduating class from Health Careers Academy will be
unique individuals who will make a difference in our community for years to
come."

In closing, she quoted Mahatma Gandhi: "We must become the change we want to see
in the world."

Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman, whose District 13 includes Stockton,
referenced Michelle Obama's commencement speech at Tuskegee University in
Alabama about the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American pilots of World
War II.

She compared their early struggles of incredibly low expectations from the
outside to what is perceived about education in Stockton and their eventual
triumph.

"When this school started, SUSD was at one of their lowest points," Eggman said.
"The city of Stockton was in one of their lowest points. With record crime,
murders, going into bankruptcy, it was a dark time.

"But the families sitting out here, the staff, the board, these students had
something maybe passed on to them from Tuskegee. They had hope. They had hope
that if they applied themselves and they worked hard, they could be that
difference that they needed, not only for themselves but for their community."

Said Linda Zaro, the first salutatorian: "I see passion. I see contributors to
society I see phenomenal and efficient young men and women that I am proud to
call my senior class."

Now HCA is faced with a growing waiting list for admittance that reaches more
than 500 so far, and with simply no room to get any bigger.

"The future of HCA is shining bright, there is something magical here ever since
birth," said Miller a day before the ceremony. "We are going to be here for many
years to come. You can't fail with the community behind us like they are today."

EXECUTIVE SALARIES;
Aaron's boosts pay for new head honcho

BYLINE: Arielle Kass; Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 288 words



HIGHLIGHT: At $850,000, CEO will make 22 percent more than predecessor.


The new top executive of Atlanta rent-to-own furniture company Aaron's will make
22 percent more than his predecessor, the company has disclosed.

Ronald Allen, a board member who was named president and CEO after Robin
Loudermilk stepped down, will receive a base salary of $850,000 this year. When
Allen took the job on an interim basis last November, his base salary was
$695,000, the same amount Loudermilk made before he left due to mental health
concerns.

Aaron's named Allen, a former CEO of Delta Air Lines, to the post permanently in
February.

Allen's total compensation for the two months he led the company in 2011 was
$525,464, the company said in a regulatory filing. The bulk of the package came
from stock awards, including restricted stock that has no value for three years.

Aaron's said in the filing that Grant Thornton, a compensation consultant, found
that the company's CEO was "significantly undercompensated in most areas of
direct compensation" compared with peer companies.

Allen also received $93,285 in cash and stock for his previous time on Aaron's
board, according to the filing.

Loudermilk's 2011 compensation was $2.8 million, including a base salary of
$589,856, $1.73 million in stock awards and a $382,964 bonus.

When he left the company, Loudermilk also received the continuation of his
health coverage for up to 18 months and a $25,067 payment to help subsidize the
cost of health care, and the immediate vesting of all of his remaining stock
options and restricted stock, the filing showed.

Aaron's founder Charlie Loudermilk, chairman of the board and Robin Loudermilk's
father, received $1.66 million in compensation in 2011, down 43 percent from
2010 due mostly to elimination of stock awards in 2011.

Celgene, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences Establish the Myeloma Genome Project

   Dec 03, 2016

   Celgene Corporation, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences announced the creation of the Myeloma Genome
Project, a collaborative initiative aimed at compiling the largest dataset of
high-quality genomic and clinical data to identify distinct molecular disease
segments within multiple myeloma to advance diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
of multiple myeloma patients.The initiative seeks to develop clinically relevant
tests. Details of the project and initial characterization and preliminary
analyses of newly diagnosed myeloma patient data were presented today by Brian
Walker, Ph.D., of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at the 58th
American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in San Diego, Calif."The Myeloma
Genome Project is a really exciting initiative that may change the way we manage
myeloma patients," said Gareth Morgan, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Myeloma
Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Current
technologies have discovered five major translocation groups within myeloma
patients and these mutations have demonstrated varying effects on prognosis. The
Myeloma Genome Project is also looking at minor translocation and mutational
groups that are often poorly described due to small sample numbers in limited
data sets. The group has established a set of 2,161 patients for which whole
exome sequencing (WESn=1,436), whole genome sequencing (WGSn=708), targeted
panel sequencing (n=993) and expression data from RNA-sequencing and gene
expression arrays (n=1,497) were available. The data were collected from the
Myeloma XI trial (UK), Intergroupe Francophone du Myeloma/Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Myeloma Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. "Understanding the various
subgroups within multiple myeloma that exhibit distinct pathogenesis and
clinical behavior is critical when looking to advance new therapies,
particularly when considering a targeted approach," said Rob Hershberg, M.D.,
Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer at Celgene. "We
look forward to the insights that this collaboration will provide for research
and for patients." "The Myeloma Genome Project expects to lead the way towards
developing personalized and targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes in
myeloma," said Nikhil Munshi, M.D., Director of Basic and Correlative Science at
the Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The
Myeloma Genome Project has begun to integrate these diverse, large genomic data
sets and is identifying genetic information that may inform clinical targets for
therapy. While analyses are not completed, the current efforts clearly
demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and the project leaders plan to
expand collaboration to include additional investigators and institutions and
present updates at future medical and scientific meetings including publications
in peer-reviewed journals.


Takeda Launches Largest Pharmaceutical Company-Sponsored Global Observational
Study of Its Kind in Multiple Myeloma

   Aug 31, 2016

   Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited announced that its global
non-interventional, observational multiple myeloma study is now enrolling
patients. Titled INSIGHT-MM, the study aims to enroll 5,000 patients over three
years with a goal of following each patient for a minimum of five years in an
effort to track patterns in disease presentation, patient characteristics,
treatment and outcomes and thereby enhance the understanding of real world
experience of patients with multiple myeloma.&ldquoAs both a physician and a
patient, I have seen &ndashand experienced &ndashrapid changes in the approach
to multiple myeloma treatment. Even with the recent introduction of new
therapies, more work needs to be done to improve outcomes for patients across
the globe,&rdquosaid Jim Omel, M.D., INSIGHT-MM Steering Committee member, who
was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1997. &ldquoThe INSIGHT-MM study gives
the community an opportunity to work together to better understand how clinical
advances affect multiple myeloma patients in the real world.&rdquo&ldquoIn
relatively rare diseases, such as multiple myeloma, we often lack access to
large datasets that can help inform decisions in our practices,&rdquosaid Faith
Davies, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Medical Director, Myeloma Institute,
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, INSIGHT-MM Steering Committee
Co-Chair. &ldquoBy gathering comprehensive real world data on this scale, we
will have the opportunity to identify best practices from across the globe to
help us better understand what works and what doesn&rsquot for specific
patients. These learnings can in turn enhance our efforts to improve disease
management for people living with multiple myeloma.&rdquo Study sites at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciencesthe University of California, San
Diegoand the University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute &ndashthe first three of
an anticipated more than 150 global locations &ndashare now active and have
enrolled the first patients in the study. Led by an international steering
committee of myeloma experts, the INSIGHT-MM study will gather data via routine
office visits, medical records and patient self-reported outcomes. Participation
in INSIGHT-MM, a non-interventional study, will not determine or alter
patients&rsquotreatmentrather, patients will receive their usual therapy as
determined by their healthcare provider during the course of their care.
Designed to be collaborative, INSIGHT-MM remains open for the multiple myeloma
community to propose analyses and request data that has been collected during
the study. &ldquoAt Takeda Oncology, we have worked with the multiple myeloma
community for the benefit of patients for nearly two decades. Given the
increased complexity of treatment in recent years, we saw the need to understand
treatment patterns and patients&rsquoexperiences around the world,&rdquosaid
Liviu&nbspNiculescu, Vice President Global and US Medical Affairs, Takeda
Oncology. &ldquoWith patients and multiple myeloma experts, we designed the
innovative INSIGHT-MM trial to be an open source of data &ndashlarge enough to
reveal differences and trends globally. We invite collaborations from other
similar studies in order to increase the size of available databases and move us
closer to a future when robust data on multiple myeloma enables us to change the
face of the disease.&rdquo The INSIGHT-MM study is currently enrolling patients
in the United States and will soon be enrolling patients globally. The following
countries are participating in the INSIGHT-MM study: The United States, the
United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Israel, France, Belgium, Greece,
Mexico, China, Taiwan, Colombia and Turkey.

NIH Awards Early Career Grants to Two UAMS Translational Research
Instituteâ[#x20ac]"Trained Researchers

   Jul 05, 2016

   University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences early career researchers Joshua
Kennedy, M.D., and Taren Swindle, Ph.D., are recipients of National Institutes
of Health (NIH) grants that will support their work over the next several years.
In May, Kennedy, whose laboratory is at Arkansas Children&rsquos Hospital
Research Institute (ACHRI) on the Arkansas Children&rsquos Hospital campus,
received notice of a five-year $877,000 NIH National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases K08 Award. He is an assistant professor of internal medicine
and pediatrics, UAMS College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics, Division of
Allergy and Immunology.Swindle, an assistant professor in the College of
Medicine Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, was recently notified
that July 1 she will receive a four-year, $442,583 NIH National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease K01 Award. Kennedy&rsquos grant
provides salary and laboratory support for his investigation into how allergies
and rhinovirus infections (common colds) work in tandem to create
life-threatening symptoms for people with asthma. He will work with patients who
experience critical asthma symptoms as a result of rhinovirus infections and
allergies, and he will conduct laboratory experiments on donated lung tissue.
The K08 Award program is an intensive, supervised research career development
experience, preparing clinical researchers such as Kennedy for careers that have
a significant impact on the health-related research needs of the country.
Swindle&rsquos research involves the study of a childcare-based nutrition
intervention and development of a strategy for implementing the intervention.
She will pilot test the implementation strategy and the intervention&rsquos
effect on child health outcomes. The K01 award is designed to advance
Swindle&rsquos expertise and skills in implementation science, child and
community nutrition, and community engagement. To help achieve her goals, she
will take part in a comprehensive plan of mentored research, didactic education,
cross-disciplinary collaborations and structured field studies. Kennedy and
Swindle said their awards were made possible by two years of research support
and training they received through the UAMS Translational Research
Institute&rsquos KL2 Mentored Research Career Development Scholar Award Program.
Kennedy and Swindle were selected for the competitive KL2 program in 2013 and
2014, respectively. &ldquoThe KL2 provided the funds necessary to produce the
preliminary data that supported the NIH K08,&rdquoKennedy said. &ldquoThe grant
was reviewed by all of my KL2 award mentors, and the CTSA (NIH Clinical and
Translational Science Award) consortium organized a special K club that provided
valuable feedback and ultimately helped my application get funded.&rdquo The KL2
has provided Swindle with training experiences in nutrition, grant writing, and
qualitative methods that were critical to her conceptualization of the K01 grant
and strengthening her qualifications as a K01 candidate, she said. &ldquoThe
protected time for mentored research on the KL2 also allowed me to secure
important preliminary data that I was able to use in my K01
application,&rdquoshe added. &ldquoThe review committee specifically mentioned
my KL2 experience as a strength in my review.&rdquo


UAMS Neighborhood Clinic Opens at Capitol Mall

   Jul 05, 2016

   The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences opened a new UAMS
Neighborhood Clinic at Capitol Mall offering scheduled appointments and walk-in
friendly, high-quality primary care services in downtown Little Rock.Charles W.
Smith, M.D., director of Primary Care Services at UAMS, said the clinic offers
the same level of service and access to health professionals as any UAMS primary
care location, with additional flexibility for walk-in patients.&ldquoThis
clinic is going to concentrate on providing services to the people who are
downtown near the Capitol Mall area, in particular the state
employees,&rdquoSmith said. &ldquoWe want to encourage them to utilize our
services for walk-in care or primary care. We will be working hard to make sure
we serve those who work or who may live downtown.&rdquo The clinic will be led
by&nbspJennifer Dukes Casey, M.D., who has most recently been practicing family
medicine at the UAMS clinic on Financial Centre Parkway in West Little Rock. She
graduated from UAMS with her medical degree in 2007. She completed her residency
at UAMS South Central in Pine Bluff, serving as chief resident from 2009-2010.
&ldquoI&rsquom excited about relocating to the Capitol district,&rdquoCasey
said. &ldquoOur presence will allow for more access to health care for those
working and residing in the area. My goal is to continue to provide superior
health care to my patients as we work to improve the health of Arkansans.&rdquo


UAMS Receives NIH Grant for First Comprehensive Study of Synthetic Marijuana
Dangers

   Jun 28, 2016

   A team of University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences researchers has
received a federal grant to conduct the first comprehensive study of the dangers
posed by synthetic marijuana products. The $2.7 million grant from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) will enable a
seven-member interdisciplinary research team to determine the toxicity of the
man-made cannabinoids and inform policymakers as they consider regulating the
products, which are intended to mimic the effects of marijuana.&ldquoSynthetic
cannabinoid products such as K2 and Spice are deceptively marketed as safe and
legal alternatives to marijuana, but admissions to emergency rooms and calls to
poison control centers suggest that they are certainly not safe,&rdquosaid Paul
Prather, Ph.D., the study&rsquos principal investigator and professor in the
UAMS College of Medicine Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology. &ldquoUsers
of these products are experiencing psychosis, seizures, heart attacks and even
death.&rdquo Since 2015, there have been 83 calls for synthetic cannabinoid
exposures to the Arkansas Poison & Drug Information Center at UAMS. Synthetic
cannabinoids are psychoactive chemicals often sprayed on plants that have been
cut up to look like natural marijuana. They are also sold as powders, tablets
and capsules. Over the next five years, the UAMS team will explore why the
synthetic compounds are more toxic than marijuana, even though both activate the
same cannabinoid receptors in the brain. Researchers will study the effects of
the man-made compounds on human cells in the lab, in mice, and in those who take
synthetic cannabinoids and are admitted to the ER at UAMS and ERs in New York.
&ldquoWhen we test patients who have used synthetic cannabinoids, we can
identify what specific compounds are being abused, the levels of compounds and
their metabolites in patient samples, and we can link this information to the
symptoms that brought them into the ER,&rdquosaid co-investigator Laura James,
M.D., a professor in the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics,
director of the UAMS Translational Research Institute, and Section Chief,
Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at Arkansas Children&rsquos Hospital.
&ldquoThe significance of this grant is that numerous experts are working across
disciplines to produce findings that will directly improve human health and
safety.&rdquo &ldquoOur goal is to provide the public and scientific community
definitive information that these compounds are not an alternate form of
marijuana that&rsquos safe,&rdquoPrather said. &ldquoThis would give federal and
state agencies grounds for further regulating these compounds.&rdquo In
addition, he said, the team&rsquos findings could help lead to antidotes for
people with synthetic cannabinoid toxicity. The NIH/NIDA grant builds on the
work of a one-year 2011 pilot study that was conducted by largely the same team
and was funded by the Translational Research Institute. That study, led by
James, resulted in development of a clinical test by co-investigator Jeffery H.
Moran, Ph.D., to determine the presence and amount of the toxic synthetic
compounds in a person&rsquos body. Their findings also informed the work of the
Arkansas Legislature, which in 2013 added new synthetic cannabinoid groups to
the state&rsquos list of controlled substances (Act 329). As part of the new
five-year study, Moran, assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacology
and Toxicology and section director of Environmental Chemistry at the Arkansas
Department of Health, will identify the synthetic cannabinoids in blood and
urine samples obtained from ER patients. Co-investigator Anna Radominska-Pandya,
Ph.D., will determine what enzymes are metabolizing (inactivating) the synthetic
cannabinoids. &ldquoThe knowledge gained from this work will help researchers
predict whether certain populations are more likely to experience adverse
effects from the drugs,&rdquosaid Radominska-Pandya, a professor in the UAMS
College of Medicine Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and
Medicine. Prather will focus on studying the synthetic compounds and metabolites
identified from the urine of the ER patients. By analyzing cells expressing
human cannabinoid receptors in his lab he will learn which specific synthetic
compounds and metabolites bind to the brain&rsquos cannabinoid receptors as well
as other aspects of their activity. For example, he said the man-made compounds
bind better to cannabinoid receptors and produce greater activity compared to
natural marijuana&rsquos main ingredient &ndashtetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These
differences in binding and activity may contribute to the synthetic
compounds&rsquotoxicity, but researchers don&rsquot yet know the specific
culprits. &ldquoNo one has ever looked at this,&rdquoPrather said. &ldquoTo this
point it&rsquos just conjecture how these compounds and metabolites bind to and
activate cannabinoid receptors.&rdquo Prather&rsquos findings will inform the
work of co-investigator William Fantegrossi, Ph.D., who will take the compounds
and metabolites that bind to the cannabinoid receptors and study their actions
in mice. &ldquoOur animal models should help clarify the toxicity associated
with these compounds,&rdquosaid Fantegrossi, associate professor in the
Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology. &ldquoRight now when a synthetic
cannabinoid user is admitted to the ER, we don&rsquot know what component of the
drug really contributed to their symptoms.&rdquo Co-investigator Susan
Abdel-Rahman, Pharm.D., professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri,
Kansas City, an expert in pharmacokinetics, will provide consultation to assist
Fantegrossi and Moran with their experiments to determine how the synthetic
cannabinoids are absorbed, distributed and eliminated in the body. The research
team will be alerted to any surges in synthetic cannabinoid use as well as new
cannabinoids that require the team&rsquos study by co-investigator Keith McCain,
Pharm.D., associate professor in the UAMS College of Pharmacy and clinical
toxicologist in the Arkansas Poison & Drug Information Center, who will be
monitoring calls to the UAMS Center.


UAMS First Arkansas Hospital Certified Gold for Infant Safe Sleep Practice

   Jun 09, 2016

   The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences is the first hospital in
Arkansas to receive the gold certification from Cribs for Kids for its
commitment to reducing infant sleep-related deaths, including sudden infant
death syndrome (SIDS), through best safety practices, community outreach and
education. UAMS is one of 44 hospitals in the nation with the designation, the
highest of three from Cribs for Kids, a national organization dedicated to
infant sleep-related death prevention.UAMS garnered the designation by adopting
a safe sleep policy, including using and promoting wearable blankets, a safe
alternative to traditional infant blanketstraining staff and educating parents
on safe sleep practices in the hospital and at homeconducting community outreach
activitiesand providing safe sleep alternatives to at-risk parents in the
community. &ldquoAs Arkansas&rsquoacademic health center, we have an obligation
to all our communities to model safe sleep and promote those practices
throughout the state,&rdquosaid Rebecca Sartini, clinical services manager in
the UAMS Medical Center&rsquos neonatal intensive care unit. According to the
Centers for Disease and Control Prevention, there are about 3,500 sudden
unexpected infant deaths each year, including about 1,500 deaths caused by SIDS.
&ldquoRecent data consistently show many more babies die as a result of SIDS
than all other causes combined, including car accidents. Safe sleep will help
prevent most of those deaths,&rdquosaid R. Whit Hall, M.D., a neonatologist and
professor in the UAMS College of Medicine&rsquos Department of Pediatrics.
&ldquoThis is a wonderful step by UAMS to lead the state in promoting safe sleep
practices and educating parents so more babies will be able to celebrate their
first birthday.&rdquo


NIH Funds UAMS Study of Depression Program in Delta

   Jun 02, 2016

   The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, in partnership with faith
leaders in the Delta, will use a five-year, $2.1 million national grant to study
a new way of addressing depression among rural African-Americans.A UAMS research
team and its 24 partner churches will test the effectiveness of a depression
education and treatment program, in addition to strategies for sustaining it
when funding expires. The grant is provided by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) National Institute of Mental Health.The research team is led by
community-based researchers Tiffany Haynes, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, and
Karen Yeary, Ph.D., who has developed strong research partnerships with faith
leaders in the Delta over the past 10 years. Their co-investigators include
UAMS&rsquoKeneshia Bryant, Ph.D., R.N.Teresa Kramer, Ph.D.Geoffrey Curran,
Ph.D.the Rev. Jerome Turner, of Marvelland the Rev. Johnny Smith, of Pine Bluff.
The eight-session program, administered by church leaders, will focus on
emotional wellness, helping people who may have depressive symptoms before they
develop clinical depression. The sessions are adapted to include faith-based
themes, scripture, and other aspects of rural African-American faith culture.
The aim of the sessions is to improve emotional well-being through preventive
approaches. Anyone experiencing depression or other mental illness will be
guided to a mental health professional. &ldquoChurches in African-American rural
communities are a key partner to reach people,&rdquosaid Yeary, an associate
professor in the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health. &ldquoWe&rsquove
partnered with churches to address physical health issues in the past, but this
is the first time we&rsquove addressed emotional well-being.&rdquo A survey
developed by UAMS and its faith-based partners went to 30 churches and
identified depression as a significant health issue for rural African-Americans.
The trust built over the years between UAMS and rural African-American churches
will help make the intervention a success, said Turner, who pastors two churches
in Phillips County. &ldquoUAMS has incorporated community at all levels of
decision making, so the community knows that its voice is being
heard,&rdquoTurner said. &ldquoI believe we will have very good results at the
conclusion of this study because we are serious about the issue and we work
extremely well as a team.&rdquo Haynes, assistant professor in the College of
Public Health, noted that rural African-Americans are disproportionately exposed
to poverty, racism and discrimination, putting them at higher risk for
experiencing depressive symptoms and development of clinical depression. Having
depressive symptoms can lead to a host of negative outcomes, including both the
development of and poor management of chronic illnesses such as hypertension and
diabetes, poor social functioning and poor occupational functioning, she said.
Although there are effective treatments, rural African-Americans often do not
receive care. &ldquoConcerns about the mental health of rural African-Americans
have been raised before, but this was the first time anyone has documented that
concern and taken this unique approach,&rdquosaid Haynes, whose early work on
the project was supported by the UAMS Translational Research Institute&rsquos
two-year KL2 Mentored Research Career Development Scholar Award Program.

USDA Gives $1.6 Million to Improve Health in Arkansas Delta

   May 25, 2016

   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has awarded $1.6 million to two
institutions to improve health in the Arkansas Delta through providing on-site
simulation training for rural providers. At a news conference at the University
of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), Vernita Dore, USDA deputy under
secretary of Rural Development, announced the funding.A grant of $752,832 goes
to the Greater Delta Alliance for Health, which will use $268,360 to contract
with UAMS and its Centers for Simulation Education to educate rural hospitals
about a variety of situations, including birthing problemstrauma, such as
tractor accidentsdiabetic complicationspediatric emergenciesand stroke. The
other grant announced by Dore was $919,139 to the Black River Technical College
in Pocahontas to purchase and upgrade simulation equipment and provide clinical
training. Medical simulation education uses people roleplaying as patients,
human manikins equipped with sophisticated electronics, and animatronics and
documents to act out clinical cases and scenarios for training health care
students and professionals. &ldquoUAMS is pleased to have a long-standing
relationship with the alliance,&rdquosaid Tim Hill, vice chancellor of UAMS
Regional Programs. &ldquoWe consider this to be a strategic partnership,
focusing on how UAMS can support the training, education and clinical
initiatives in the Delta region of Arkansas. We&rsquore delighted in the recent
announcement that the Greater Delta Alliance for Health will be awarded this
significant grant from the USDA that will help provide simulation training in
that region. We congratulate the alliance&rsquos leadership for this achievement
and look forward to supporting their efforts.&rdquo Some of the remaining grant
funds will purchase training manikins and other simulation equipment, as well as
a van to transport the equipment. The rest of the grant will pay for 30
firefighters in the Arkansas Delta to become certified EMTs. The training to be
provided by UAMS is a part of the alliance&rsquos Arkansas Delta Health
Education for Local Providers (HELP) Program. In 2016, the HELP program expanded
to include on-site simulation training for rural health and hospital teams for
obstetrical emergency situations as well as to provide Neonatal Resuscitation
Program (NRP) certification training to hospital delivery teams, other hospital
medical staff members, pre-hospital providers, inter-facility transport
providers, and emergency department staff in the Arkansas Delta. &ldquoThe grant
will help us to build on our earlier efforts and be of vital support to the
alliance in achieving its goal of improving the health care workforce in the
Arkansas Delta by providing free, on-site trauma simulation training and
certification,&rdquosaid Mellie Bridewell, executive director of the Greater
Delta Alliance for Health. To establish and maintain current best medical
practices and to better serve their Delta patients, the Greater Delta Alliance
for Health, a not-for-profit organization of 10 Arkansas Delta hospitals,
initiated the Arkansas Delta Health Education for Local Providers (HELP) Program
in 2012. &nbspRelying on the educational expertise of the UAMS Center for
Distance Health and telehealth technology, the HELP Program began with on-site
health literacy training and access to continuing education for health care
providers throughout the 19-county South Arkansas Delta. The Greater Delta

Celgene Gift to UAMS Myeloma Institute for Bart Barlogie Center for Molecular
Diagnostics Advances the Course of Human Health for Patients with Multiple
Myeloma

   Mar 02, 2015

   The Myeloma Institute at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
(UAMS) has received a generous gift from Celgene Corporation to benefit patients
with multiple myeloma through the creation of The Bart Barlogie Center for
Molecular Diagnostics and the establishment of the Celgene Distinguished Endowed
Chair in Molecular Therapeutics."This is an exciting, new collaboration between
the Myeloma Institute and Celgene, bringing together leading institutions for
consummate innovation in myeloma research," said Gareth Morgan, M.D., Ph.D.,
director of the institute. "There has been a 57 percent increase in the total
number of myeloma survivors since 2001 as a result of medical innovation. This
is encouraging news for myeloma patients and our health care system but we can
and must do better. The Bart Barlogie Center creates an exciting opportunity for
the next generation of revolutionary transformation in myeloma care."The use and
refinement of genomics and other novel diagnostic tools will enable development
of precision medicine strategies aimed at targeting the distinct genetic signals
that affect each patient's disease. Through a deeper understanding of the
molecular changes that take place in myeloma, the Myeloma Institute will be
better equipped to identify the most appropriate drug therapies that will
produce the best outcomes with minimal toxicity and that will make a cure truly
achievable for the majority of patients," Morgan said. "Celgene's contribution
to the UAMS Myeloma Institute reflects our continuing commitment to advance
transformational science, deliver life-enhancing medicines and serve patients
with multiple myeloma the world over," said Bob Hugin, chairman and CEO of
Celgene Corp. "The Myeloma Institute has established itself as a leader in
developing precision medicine strategies, and we're happy to support it in
continuing that standard of innovation and excellence." From its founding in
1989 until 2014, Barlogie led the UAMS myeloma program. Barlogie chose in 2014
to step down as director of the Myeloma Institute to focus on clinical care and
research, with an emphasis on curing high-risk myeloma. Morgan became director
July 1. He came to UAMS from The Royal Marsden Institute NHS Foundation Trust
and the Institute of Cancer Research in London where he was a professor of
hematology and director of the Centre for Myeloma Research. At a ceremony today
at UAMS, Gov. Asa Hutchinson thanked Celgene for supporting UAMS and the state
of Arkansas. "A shared compassion for myeloma patients and their care along with
a commitment to innovation in that care has been the foundation of a vital,
long-lasting partnership between Celgene and the Myeloma Institute," Hutchinson
said. The myeloma program at UAMS has seen more than 11,000 patients from every
state in the United States and more than 50 foreign countries and has performed
more than 9,000 peripheral blood stem cell transplants. "Barlogie and his
colleagues fundamentally changed the course of the disease and its effects
through new diagnostic procedures and therapeutic interventions," Hugin said.
"Celgene has been happy to work with him for many years, and we wanted to
acknowledge his achievement in a lasting and meaningful way with this center."
An endowed chair is one of the highest academic honors that can be bestowed on
its most distinguished faculty by a university and donor. The endowment provides
a dependable source of income for academic program support and creates permanent
legacies for some of its most distinguished professors. Celgene contributed $10
million to the UAMS Myeloma Institute for The Bart Barlogie Center for Molecular
Diagnostics and the endowed chair. "The Celgene Endowed Chair in Molecular
Therapeutics will ensure continued recruitment and support retention of the
highest caliber faculty members, who will bring new ideas and create new
programs related to molecular therapeutics, an essential component of precision
medicine," said UAMS Chancellor Dan Rahn, M.D. "We're grateful for this generous
gift from a company that has such a strong history of collaboration with the
Myeloma Institute and UAMS." Headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, Celgene Corp.
is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the
discovery, development and delivery of innovative therapies for the treatment of
cancer and inflammatory diseases through gene and protein regulation. UAMS is
the state's only comprehensive academic health center, with colleges of
Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Health Professions and Public Healtha graduate
schoola hospitala northwest Arkansas regional campusa statewide network of
regional centersand seven institutes: the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer

UAMS Researcher Develops Way to Track Single Circulating Tumor Cells

   Jun 23, 2014

   Researchers from University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York have developed a new
technological approach for tracking individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in
the bloodstream, helping researchers identify the pathways of single cancer
cells inside the body and that holds the promise to prevent cancer from
spreading.. "The approach may give oncologists a method to track individual CTCs
and distinguish the behavior of metastatically aggressive CTCs from other ones.
We hope, this knowledge will lead to development new therapeutic approaches to
target only dangerous CTCs, and, eventually, to intervene and stop cancer more
effectively," said Ekaterina Galanzha, M.D., Ph.D., and an associate research
professor in the UAMS College of Medicine's Department of Otolaryngology, Head
and Neck Surgery. The findings of Galanzha as a leader of this research were
recently published in Chemistry & Biology, a prestigious scientific journal.
UAMS team includes also Vladimir Zharov, Ph.D., D.Sc., senior scientist in the
UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Research Institute, and Dmitry Nedosekin,
Ph.D., UAMS College of Medicine research associate in the UA. Up to 90 percent
of all cancer deaths are caused by metastases (spread of cancer) produced by
CTCs. Fortunately, only less than 0.01 percent of CTCs are able to form
metastases. Therefore, there is a crucial need to detect these metastatically
aggressive CTCs. The significant progress has been made in molecular
characterization of CTCs while the behavior patterns of aggressive CTCs remains
almost unclear. The new approach so-called in vivo photoswitchable flow
cytometry uses photoswitchable fluorescent proteins that can change their color
in response to light and that can be genetically incorporated into cancer cells.
To label (change color) individual CTCs, very thin laser beam with a diameter
comparable to the diameter of one cell was focused into a small blood vessel.
This schematic allows labelling the controlled number of cells, even one CTC
because only one CTC passes laser beam at a moment of time. To extend the
capability of photoswitchable flow cytometry, researchers integrated three thin
parallel laser beams operated at different wavelengths. Thus, CTCs are counted
before labeling with the first laser beam, then some of these can be labeled
with the second laser beam, and labeling efficacy is estimated with the third
laser beam. Furthermore, this technical platform tracks labeled CTCs over a
period of time. The obtained information from each cell is collected, detected
and reproduced on a computer monitor as real-time signal traces, allowing the
investigators to count and track individual CTCs in the bloodstream. "This
technology allows for the labeling of just one circulating pathological cell
among billions of other normal blood cells by the ultrafast changing color of
photosensitive proteins inside the cell in response to laser light," Galanzha
said. Researchers were able to monitor the real-time dynamics of CTCs released
from a primary tumor, and then image the various final destinations of
individual CTCs. They observed how these cells circulate and colonize healthy
tissue or the site of the primary tumor (self-seeding phenomenon). Researchers
also demonstrated the images of cancer cells that colonize tissue but did not
grow (so-called dormant cells). For the first time, they visualized that CTCs
are able to enter existing metastases (reseeding phenomenon). The significance
of this phenomenon for metastasis progression will be explored in the upcoming
experiments. The approach also might prove useful for other areas of medicine --
for example, tracking bacteria during infectious sepsis or immune-related cells
during the development of autoimmune diseases.


University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Joins AROK Purchasing Coalition, LLC


   Jun 02, 2014

   VHA Inc. announced that the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
(UAMS) has joined the AROK Purchasing Coalition, LLC. The AROK Purchasing

more than 50 countries. "By joining AROK, UAMS will be able to access resources
to quickly improve supply chain performance as well as collaborate with a
network of our peers to foster innovation and improvements that will benefit our
patients and the communities we serve," said Roxane Townsend, M.D., UAMS Medical
Center CEO and vice chancellor for clinical programs. The AROK Purchasing
Coalition was established in 2008 to stabilize and drive down non-salary
expenses of the member organizations for supplies, pharmaceuticals, equipment,
new technology and purchased services. AROK transacts over $705 million annually
in member purchases and has saved members approximately $50 million since its
inception.


UAMS Programs Receive More Than $450,000 from Blue & You Foundation, Arkansas
Blue Cross and Blue Shield

   Feb 03, 2014

   The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' (UAMS) Center for Dental
Education, the planned internal medicine residency program in northwest Arkansas
and the physician assistant program were among UAMS programs that received
grants totaling more than $450,000 from the Blue & You Foundation and its parent
company, Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield.The Blue & You Foundation today
awarded more than $350,000 in grants to UAMS programs including $150,000 to the
Center for Dental Education and $95,000 to the physician assistant program, both
in the UAMS College of Health Professions. A $77,500 grant was presented to the
UAMS Northwest regional campus and area hospitals creating an internal medicine
residency program to expand the number of resident physicians being trained in
that part of the state. A $29,722 grant was awarded to the Safety Baby Showers
program at UAMS South in Magnolia that has provided infant safety training and
safety equipment to new or expectant parents in south Arkansas.The Center for
Dental Education also received $100,000 in support from Arkansas Blue Cross and
Blue Shield. Together the $450,000 in grants and support from the two
organizations will allow for continued development or expansion of education,
patient care and outreach programs at UAMS. The Blue & You Foundation grants and
support from Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield provide much-needed funding for
programs that aid the UAMS mission of health care improvement in Arkansas
through education of new health care professionals, increasing the number of
physicians providing patient care and helping parents learn potentially
lifesaving infant safety techniques, said UAMS Chancellor Dan Rahn, M.D. Patrick
O'Sullivan, executive director of the Blue & You Foundation, joined UAMS
officials to announce the grants. The Center for Dental Education, physician
assistant program, internal medicine residency program and Safety Baby Showers
program all received previous grants from the Blue & You Foundation. These UAMS
programs reinforce the mission of the Blue & You Foundation to support programs
that bring communities together in positive and healthy ways. We are excited to
support their work in making Arkansas safer and healthier, O'Sullivan said. The
grant to the Center for Dental Education will support an externship program at
UAMS for fourth-year dental students from the University of Tennessee College of
Dentistry to start in February. The students will spend time working in the
center's Oral Health Clinic and at Arkansas Children's Hospital providing
general dental care for patients under supervision of adjunct faculty. The
$100,000 in support from Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield continues the
development of a dental residency program and provides equipment for the clinic,
which will soon open five more exam rooms -- for a total of 10 -- along with a
lab and sterilization area it will share with the adjacent UAMS dental hygiene
program. The grants to our Center for Dental Education and physician assistant
programs continue the momentum for two of our newest programs, improving access
to medical or oral health care as well as growing the number of health care
professionals in Arkansas, said College of Health Professions Dean Douglas
Murphy, Ph.D. The $95,000 grant to the physician assistant program will continue
development for the program established in 2011, including raising awareness of
the physician assistant profession among Arkansas physicians and preparing them
to host students while they gain further clinical experience. The first class of
26 physician assistant students started the 28-month master's degree program in
2013. Physician Assistants are licensed medical providers who work with the
supervision of a physician. They take patient medical histories, conduct
physical exams, order diagnostic tests, diagnose medical conditions, write
prescriptions and manage acute illness and chronic disease with the supervision
of a physician. The internal medicine residency program in northwest Arkansas,
which hopes to admit its first group of eight physicians in July 2015, is
continuing to move through the accreditation process. The three-year program
will have a total of 24 residents, admitting eight each year, who will see
patients at five hospital systems in the region -- Mercy Rogers, Mercy Fort
Smith, the Springdale-based Northwest Health System, the Sparks Health System in
Fort Smith and the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks -- as the
physicians serve a post-medical school residency. We are moving steadily forward
in the multi-step process for establishing and gaining accreditation for our
internal medicine residency and we could not have come this far without the
support of the Blue & You Foundation, said Peter Kohler, M.D., vice chancellor
for UAMS Northwest. We had a positive site visit in August 2013 from the
accrediting body and feel good that we are creating the kind of quality program
that will help patients in Arkansas for many years to come. Funding to the
residency program is for equipment and resources to coordinate the conferences
and continuing education fees associated with providing CME credit to physicians
who will be preceptors supervising the resident physicians at the hospitals. The
grant to the three-year-old Safety Baby Showers program, based at UAMS South in
Magnolia, will cover program costs for a year of safety classes that have
reached about 200 new or expectant parents a year in Ouachita and Columbia
counties. Participants learn about motor vehicle injury prevention, safe sleep
practices for infants, infant CPR and choke-safety, and home safety. We've had a
great response from those who have participated in Safety Baby Showers to date
and are excited at the support that will continue this program, said Rebecka
Wendling, outreach coordinator for the Safety Baby Showers program. Along with
the safety training, the participants receive a portable crib and other home
safety items, such as cabinet locks, that are intended to reduce the risk of
injury to infants. Founded in 1948, Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield, an
independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, is the
largest health insurer in Arkansas. Arkansas Blue Cross and its affiliates have
more than 2,500 employees.

UAMS Professors among First to Earn New Clinical Informatics Certification

   Dec 18, 2013

   Two University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) professors are among
only four physicians in Arkansas recently to earn board certification in
clinical informatics, a medical specialty focused on safer and more efficient
patient care.Joseph Jensen, M.D., an associate professor in the UAMS Department
of Surgery and associate chief medical officer for safety and quality at the
UAMS Medical Center, and Donnal Walter, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor in
the UAMS Department of Pediatrics and chief medical information officer at
Arkansas Children's Hospital, were tested in October for the new board
certification and joined the inaugural class of board-certified clinical
informaticians.Clinical informatics improves the delivery of health care by
leveraging components of clinical care, health systems-based practice and
information and communications technology. Clinical informaticians also are
trained to ensure that the privacy and security of health care information is
safeguarded, particularly as the use of health information technology expands.
Before electronic health records, comparative analysis of a patient's medical
case with similar cases hardly was an option, Jensen said. But now a physician
using clinical informatics and information technology can comparatively analyze
clinical information as well as work to eliminate medication errors, redundant
testing and other inefficiencies. It means improving how people in medicine
communicate, Jensen said. Clinical informatics touches everything in health
care. For many years in health care, we have understood the importance of
keeping a good record and describing and communicating about patient care.
Clinical informatics provides us tools to do this much more efficiently, over
remote distances and with data standardized so that we can learn from the
experiences of large groups of patients. In September 2011, the American Board
of Medical Specialties (ABMS) approved the creation of a new board certification
program in clinical informatics, offering it through the American Board of
Preventive Medicine and the American Board of Pathology. The Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in cooperation with the American
Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) is developing pathways to create
accredited clinical informatics fellowships. According to the ABMS, the goals of
the clinical informatics subspecialty include establishing a standardized
educational and certification process for physicians in the field and enabling
physicians to transform the health care into a system that taps the power of
computer-bases systems to support all facets of health care delivery. Both
Jensen and Walter have many years of experience as clinicians and working with
health care information systems. Only qualified applicants with such experience
were allowed to take the examination for board certification in clinical
informatics.


UAMS Receives $10m Grant From NIH To Strengthen Microbiology And Immunology
Research Program

   Sep 26, 2012

   The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) received about $10m
grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to strengthen its
microbiology and immunology research program.The NIH grant will fund the
establishment of a Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) at the
university and supports the work of four young investigators focused on studying
how microbial pathogens interact with the human body to cause disease. The
funding totaled more than $10.03m and was awarded as a five-year grant from the
NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences.Dr Mark Smeltzer, COBRE
program director and professor in the UAMS department of microbiology and
immunology, said, To apply for a COBRE, you must first develop a central theme
and support structure that provides the foundation for junior investigators to
develop independent research careers. You then build on that foundation to
expand the research program around the central theme. UAMS COBRE will focus on
understanding how different types of microbial pathogens -- such as viruses,
bacteria and parasites -- illicit inflammatory responses in a common host, the
human body. Smeltzer also said, Infectious disease is the result of the
interaction between the microbial pathogen and its host. Although the pathogens
are very different, there are likely common elements since they cause disease in
the same human host. Understanding those elements would be invaluable in
developing new therapies and medications for many illnesses. To receive COBRE
funding, the institution must demonstrate that it has senior investigators to
support the success of the junior investigators as they develop into independent
scientists. This structure at UAMS includes Smeltzer and Dr Richard P Morrison,
professor and chairman of the department of microbiology and immunology. Junior
investigators in the COBRE are assistant professors in the department of
microbiology and immunology Dr Jason Stumhofer, Dr Craig Forrest and Dr Karl
Boehme and Dr Amy Scurlock, associate professor of pediatrics in the UAMS
College of Medicine and a researcher at the Arkansas Children's Hospital
Research Institute.

Rock

Aug 04, 2011

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. along with the Clinton Foundation and the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) launched two new electric car charging
stations in Little Rock. Through Entergy's Environmental Initiatives Fund, the
company has partnered with Coulomb Technologies, Inc. to fund the cost and
installation of 16 electric vehicle charging stations at college campuses in and
around Entergy Arkansas's service area.The charging stations in Arkansas,
located at the Clinton Presidential Center and UAMS were donated through a
$160,000 grant by Entergy's Environmental Initiatives Fund.Jim Garland, customer
service manager for Entergy Arkansas, said, "Electric vehicles are being
embraced as an important technology solution for our nation's energy future.
This program is part of our commitment to support technologies that foster
environmental sustainability and provide for clean, efficient, and affordable
power for today and for years to come." The charging stations were manufactured
by Coulomb Technologies and are part of Coulomb Technologies's ChargePoint
network. The ChargePoint network allows Entergy Arkansas access to data
including usage reports, greenhouse gas and gasoline savings. Jordan Johnson,
spokesman for the Clinton Foundation, said, "The Clinton Foundation is honored
to play a role in helping Entergy Arkansas elevate the importance of sustainable
transportation." The charging station at UAMS, the state's academic health
sciences center, is at one of its parking decks where it is available to
patients, visitors, employees and the community. Jonathan Flannery, executive
director of the UAMS engineering and operations department, said, "We were glad
to have the opportunity partner with Entergy Arkansas and Verdek to install the
car charger at UAMS. It builds on a growing campus sustainability effort that
has included installation of energy-saving measures at our power plant and an
expanding campus recycling campaign." Installation of the charging stations was
completed by Verdek, Coulomb Technologies's south central regional distributor.
Guy Mannino, CEO of Verdek, said, "We are proud to play a part in expanding the
ChargePoint network into the south central region. As more zero-emission
vehicles become available, providing convenient ways to charge is essential for
consumer adoption of this new form of transportation."

Alumna expands impact, earns national award

LENGTH: 583  words

DATELINE: Des Moines


Des Moines University has issued the following news release:

"I wanted to have a broader impact on oral health care and the opportunity to
work in public health," she says.

Lenhart did just that as a student in DMU's master's degree in public health
(M.P.H.) program. She received the 2014 Lee Holder Award for Excellence in
Graduate Allied Health Education, a national honor of the Alpha Eta Society for
the allied health professions.

As part of her degree program, Lenhart took on an unpaid internship with the
Iowa Public Health Association. In 2013, when the association and the Delta
Dental of Iowa Foundation cofounded Iowans for Oral Health, a coalition that
strives to maintain community water fluoridation (CWF) as a public health
benefit, she became its project coordinator. She addressed threats to CWF and
worked with communities to apply for funding from the Delta Foundation's CWF
grant program. She also gave numerous presentations around the state.

"Maren became a conduit of information between the department, our stakeholders
and communities," says Bob Russell, D.D.S., M.P.H., public health dental
director and chief of the Bureau of Oral and Health Delivery Systems of the Iowa
Department of Public Health (IDPH). "She allowed us to diversify our ability to
be in multiple places around the state."

For her required M.P.H. capstone project, Lenhart became an oral health
consultant with the Delta Dental of Iowa Foundation, the charitable organization
funded by Delta Dental of Iowa. She researched and analyzed data surrounding
oral health access for aging Iowans and children. She also reviewed oral health
education and prevention programs and produced a proposal to enhance the
foundation's school-based dental sealant program.

Her efforts, along with $170,000 from the foundation and collaboration with IDPH
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, established 11 new sealant
programs in underserved schools and expanded those services from five to 32
counties. "It was great to see the funding have a larger impact and improve
access to care," she says.

Amid all this activity, Lenhart served two years as treasurer of the DMU M.P.H.
Student Club, for which she helped plan networking events for M.P.H. students
and public health professionals.

"Because so much of the M.P.H. program is delivered online, we are always
looking for ways in which to help the distance students feel connected to the
University, so efforts such as Maren's are always greatly appreciated," says
College of Health Sciences (CHS) Dean Jodi Cahalan, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S., PA-C,
DFFAAPA. When Lenhart graduated from DMU in May 2014, Cahalan presented her with
the CHS Dean's Leadership Award. And when Lenhart received the Lee Holder Award
on Oct. 22, during the annual conference of the Association of Schools of Allied
Health Professions, it also was presented by Cahalan, president of the national
Alpha Eta Board.

Now a public benefit planning analyst with the Delta Dental of Iowa Foundation,
Lenhart continues to conduct research, evaluate programs, counsel grant-seekers
and facilitate communications regarding oral health.

"Every day presents new opportunities for me to utilize my public health
education," she says. "It is rewarding seeing the results of programs over time
and to collaborate with other stakeholders that want to improve oral health and
overall health."

The association between gum disease and other chronic inflammatory conditions,
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases, can be a
major factor in a patient's overall health.

Almost all patients at Good Shepherd Ministries in Oklahoma City have one or
more of these conditions, so comprehensive dental care, in addition to the
medical care they receive, is vital.

Recognizing this, Delta Dental of Oklahoma and its Oral Health Foundation are
large supporters of the Good Shepherd free dental clinic. Since 2002, Delta
Dental has donated $648,600 to the organization for dental equipment and
supplies. That includes $190,200 this year.

The Good Shepherd Ministries clinic was founded in 1977 and began providing
dental care in 1982. The clinic provides medical care for underserved and
uninsured patients at no cost. Good Shepherd provides cleanings, fillings,
dentures and partials in addition to extractions and served more than 2,000
dental patients last year.

"The Affordable Care Act did nothing to address access to dental care," said
Terrisa Singleton, director of the Delta Dental of Oklahoma Oral Health
Foundation. "In Oklahoma, emergency extractions are the only dental services
covered by Medicaid for adults. That means even if a patient is fortunate enough
to have SoonerCare coverage, he or she still must suffer through months of
dental pain before the infected tooth becomes sufficiently decayed to qualify
for emergency extraction - unless they find a resource like Good Shepherd. "

Delta Dental's philanthropic gift includes a challenge grant that will match
donations from other sources, dollar for dollar, up to $50,000. This challenge
grant, Singleton said, was initiated to stimulate additional monetary donations
to the Good Shepherd clinic, which is currently in financial distress.

"Basically, if it wasn't for Delta Dental's foundation, we probably wouldn't be
able to run our dental clinic," said Pam Timmons, executive director Good
Shepherd Ministries. "They have not only helped us financially, but helped us
with community awareness by giving us a grant to pay the Gooden Group to do PR
and marketing for us. "

Delta Dental's philanthropic efforts don't end with Good Shepherd Ministries.
Through its Oral Health Foundation, Delta Dental of Oklahoma awarded more than
$2 million to oral health access and education programs across the state this
year, and has contributed almost $19 million to such endeavors since the
foundation was founded in 1998.

Seventy percent of this funding goes toward providing access to dental care to
various low-income and vulnerable populations. Other funding supports
professional education at the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry and
other state universities, education of the state's youth with the Captain
Supertooth dental health education program in elementary schools, and other
initiatives.

Grant aims to help doctors find kids at risk for dental problems

BYLINE: JAY GREENE

SECTION: Pg. 15 Vol. 30

LENGTH: 767  words


The Altarum Institute, an Ann Arbor-based nonprofit agency specializing in
health care, is using a $9.4 million federal grant to develop an early
identification system to help primary care physicians screen more than 1 million
children in Michigan who may be at high risk for dental problems.

Working with Delta Dental of Michigan, the University of Michigan School of
Dentistry and the Michigan Department of Community Health, Altarum is focusing
on improving dental health of children ages 1-17 enrolled in Medicaid or
MIChild, said Dan Armijo, Altarum's vice president and director of information
and technology strategies.

Of Michigan's 2.3 million children, at least 1.2 million are covered through
Medicaid or MIChild, the state's children's health insurance program.

"While many young children make it to the doctor, considerably fewer make it to
see their dentist," Armijo said. "We hope to change that and improve the outcome
for Michigan's at-risk children."

Jed Jacobson, Delta Dental's senior vice president and chief science officer,
said because children are more likely to have a primary care physician visit
than a trip to the dentist office, educating physicians about good oral health
and the need to refer children to dentists is paramount.

Armijo said dental decay is the most common unmet health care need, especially
for children living in families under the federal poverty line. For example, of
those children who go to preschool Head Start, only 20 percent have ever been to
a dentist's office, he said.

"This will save tax dollars because there is evidence that receiving preventive
dental care significantly reduces cavities, and earlier dental intervention
costs far less than ending up in the ER of a hospital," Armijo said.

Armijo said the child dental project is designed to create an automated system
to increase access to dentists by integrating care with pediatricians and family
practice doctors.

Since 2011, UM's dental school has been developing a list of questions for a
screening and software program to help physicians identify children with dental
problems and assist in referring them to dentists, said Margherita Fontana, a UM
dental school professor and co-coordinator with the department of cariology,
restorative sciences and endodontics.

The questionnaire is being shared with physicians, and the software is expected
to be developed by 2017, Fontana said.

Fontana said UM also will work with Delta Dental to create a dental referral
network for pediatricians and family physicians.

"There are pediatricians right now that are doing oral health screening," she
said. "Part of the problem is many children don't see their dentist unless they
are in pain or need to be hospitalized."

Because the majority of the 25 percent of children with serious dental problems
live in low-income families, Fontana said parents don't have a lot of time or
resources to bring their children to the dentist.

"Part of the approach is to catch the risk behavior early on in pediatrician
offices," Fontana said. "We can save a lot of money and time by educating
parents in (primary care) offices about dental care. ... But once you have a
hole in your tooth, a cavity, you must be referred to a dentist."

Jacobson said dentists in Michigan also will test a monitoring system using the
American Dental Association's oral health measures. They include use of hospital
emergency departments, follow-up, use of general anesthesia, treatment following
sealant use and early extraction of permanent teeth.

"This is exciting because for the first time, we will use quality metrics to
measure some of the things dentists already do," he said.

Jacobson said Delta Dental has had experience administering children's dental
health through the state Medicaid program's Healthy Kids Dental, which began in
2000.

"We see this grant as an extension of that program," Jacobson said.

Under Gov. Rick Snyder's 2015 budget recommendation, Healthy Kids Dental would
increase the number of children covered to 600,000 in 2015 from 500,000 this
year. If the Legislature approves, the cost to expand the program would be $5.4
million.

Jacobson said at least 80 percent of the state's 6,000 physicians accept the
Healthy Kids Dental program. The state pays dentists who participate in Healthy
Kids higher reimbursement rates than they do for adults, he said.

"The dental profession does a good job in taking care of kids they currently
see. The deficit is kids who don't go to a dental office."

The funding for Altarum's three-year project was provided by the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services' innovation program.

shrunk a little: R.T. Jones Regional Hospital in Canton will drop out of the
metro Atlanta super-alliance effective July 1.

Cherokee County Hospital Authority members voted unanimously Monday night to
pull out of the 10-hospital network. They said the mood of the community had
turned against Promina since the disclosure of a consultant's recommendation
that the hospital convert to an outpatient care center. The authority will seek
a new partner that would promise to keep the 84-bed facility in business.

Authority members said they will begin talks this week with potential partners
Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Emory University, Georgia Baptist Medical Center and
Quorum Health Resources Inc.

The Promina network includes hospitals in Cobb, Gwinnett, Paulding and Douglas
counties, as well as Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital in Buckhead.

A spokesman for Promina said the company plans to open a $ 3.5 million primary
care center in Canton in August and a second center two or three years from now
that would include extensive services.

NEWTON COUNTY

DEVELOPMENT DENIED: Newton County residents who like their rural residential
neighborhood just the way it is got a reprieve from development Tuesday.
Commission Chairman Davis Morgan, faced with breaking a tie vote on a rezoning
to allow an 83,296-square-foot strip shopping center in the area, voted against
the project. Morgan had refrained from breaking the tie at the commission's May
2 meeting, saying he needed more time to study the issue. Since then, he had
been contacted by people on both sides but had not said which way he was
leaning.

COBB COUNTY

WINDY HILL RELIEF: For commuters accustomed to being queued up on I- 75 waiting
to negotiate the jams on Windy Hill Road, there's hope in sight. Cobb County
officials broke ground Tuesday for the $ 26 million Windy Ridge Parkway
envisioned as a release valve for traffic congestion. "That's probably the worst
congested area in Cobb County," Cobb Transportation Director Jim Croy said.
Crossing I-75 just south of the existing highway, the new four-lane will provide
an outlet for local traffic traveling between Cobb Parkway and Powers Ferry Road
or between malls and offices in the Cumberland-Galleria area. The project will
take about two years to complete.

FULTON COUNTY

TAX RATE DEBATE: After several failed attempts, a sharply divided Fulton Board
of Commissioners today will try to set the county's property tax rate. The
commission missed the May 15 state-mandated deadline for setting the millage
rate, amid political squabbling. County officials, meanwhile, cautioned that
collection of property taxes in the city of Atlanta and Fulton County, scheduled
to begin July 1, may not begin on time.

CLAYTON COUNTY

DELTA DENIED: A property tax break that could have saved Delta Air Lines as much
as $ 11 million tentatively has been denied by the Clayton County Board of Tax
Assessors. The airline had sought relief through freeport laws, which exempt
certain manufacturing inventories from ad valorem taxes. Delta, which can file
an appeal, said aircraft parts it manufactures for its planes should qualify.
However, county officials cited a court decision that such parts have to be made
for resale outside of the state to be eligible for exemption.

NAACP CHIEF INVESTIGATED: Clayton County police are investigating the president
of the county's National Association for the Advacement of Colored People
chapter in the disappearance of almost $ 7,000 in county grants, according to
Clayton County Police Chief Ronnie Clackum. Police are looking into whether
Oscar Blalock intercepted funds meant for an NAACP summer youth program in 1993
and 1994, Clackum said. Already under investigation in the case is NACCP vice
president Ifeoma Bradley-Ukadike, the county's former housing director. Blalock
did not return a reporter's phone calls Tuesday.

'Our financial house is in order'

BYLINE: Zachary K. Johnson, The Record, Stockton, Calif.

SECTION: NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS

LENGTH: 770 words


March 25--STOCKTON -- Looking back on recent history, Board of Supervisors
Chairwoman Kathy Miller said the San Joaquin County government had been able to
pass through the "Great Recession" in better shape than other local agencies
that were hit hard by the slowdown.

Looking to the future, Miller said the county has been working with businesses
and other public agencies on projects and ideas that will help bolster the
county's economy in the years the come.

These ideas were part of a State of the County presentation at the start of the
board's Tuesday meeting. "I'm pleased to report the state of San Joaquin County
is strong," said Miller.

Besides county financial policies and economic development, Miller focused her
15-minute speech on health care and public safety and reiterated local
opposition to state plans to build a pair of tunnels that would divert Delta
water for export.

"Our financial house is in order," she said. Miller praised employee sacrifices
as well as board policies to build up reserves and to only use money from
recurring revenue to pay for ongoing program costs, instead using one-time
revenue for one-time investments. "And we have embarked on several initiatives
to expand our local economy. Increase jobs, keep our citizens safe, provide
outstanding health care services to area residents and protect our precious
water and agricultural resources."

The state-of-affairs address is not unusual to government agencies, but it is a
new addition to county government. In recent years, the incoming chairman of the
board would make a speech during the annual rotation of the leadership position
in January. But the board voted to make Miller chairwoman instead of Supervisor
Carlos Villapudua, who would have become chairman under the rotation that had
been followed in previous years.

It was a surprising and controversial move that left little room for speeches.

On Tuesday, Miller's assessment of economic development looked forward to
Stockton Metropolitan Airport handling international passengers and the nearby
Airpark599 welcoming new commercial development. "Our airport is a powerful
potential economic engine which we must protect and develop."

She highlighted Innovation Hub San Joaquin, part of a statewide effort to create
"research clusters." In San Joaquin County, the "iHub" will have an H2O
Hackathon, meant to bring together students and other innovators together for a
brainstorming session to try to find better ways to manage water. The Hackathon
was originally scheduled to happen this month, but it is now scheduled for
autumn.

To increase the public's safety, she said the county is working with the state
to pay for the start-up and ongoing costs needed to add more jail beds and other
ways to increase capacity. "But the focus cannot be entirely on jails, because
we cannot simply incarcerate our way to public safety. Crime prevention is the
key," she said. She highlighted a $3 million grant meant to reduce school
violence and increase graduation rates.

The county's San Joaquin General Hospital "is a source of pride for the county,
but also a fiscal challenge," she said. She also said the county would continue
to push the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to build an expanded outpatient
clinic and nursing home for the region's veterans.

In the meantime, the county would try to maintain an existing relationship to
bring veterans to San Joaquin General and expand that relationship to add mental
health care, she said.

Since the county struck a deal last year to bring patients in the VA system to
San Joaquin General, the number of referrals has been low. As of last week, the
number was 51, according to hospital officials last week. These were: two
inpatient cases, 15 outpatient cases and 34 from the emergency room.

Miller also attacked the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. The state is pushing the
plan as something that would improve California's water infrastructure and help
the Delta, but the county is among groups opposing it. Miller said it had "fatal
flaws" and would "not produce one additional drop" of water. The plan includes
diverting water from the Delta, which she said would be devastating.

"The health of the Delta, its environment and its $1.4 billion economy are
inextricably linked to the economies of San Joaquin County, our region and the
state."

Mississippi: Population Studies Center Advances Understanding of Post-Recession
Era

LENGTH: 925  words

DATELINE: New York



 Jackson: The University of Mississippi has issued the following news release:



 Recognizing that the seeds of many social ills were planted after the Great
Recession, the Center for Population Studies at the University of Mississippi is
collaborating with researchers across the country to share findings and examine
courses of action.





 A group of scholars associated with the Western Association of Agricultural
Experiment Directors recently held its 2016 meeting in Mississippi, co-hosted
and co-sponsored by the Center for Population Studies and the UM Department of
Sociology and Anthropology and McLean Institute for Public Service and Community
Engagement.



 "The Center for Population Studies is somewhat unique among our peers across
the country in focusing on connecting multimethod population studies with
community development research, especially in relation to health and local food
systems," said John J. Green, UM professor of sociology and director of the
center and the Society and Health minor program in the College of Liberal Arts.



 "With ever-increasing access to data online, we are doing more and more work
focused on helping organizations to access and utilize population data to inform
their work. In addition to filling data requests, providing technical assistance
and analysis, we also provide participatory workshops to assist people in
accessing, interpreting and actually using data."



 As part of a multistate research project on "The Great Recession: Its Aftermath
and Patterns of Rural and Small Town Demographic Change," 16 scholars from
Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C., joined seven of
their Mississippi colleagues to present research on demographic and
socioeconomic issues of concern.



 "We discussed strategies for better disseminating our work to the public and
developed plans for the next five years of work together," Green said. "There is
attention being directed toward population health in Mississippi, nationally and
globally.



 "We are working through the center to help people understand the demographic
basis for population health, including attention to population structures,
characteristics and composition. In order to improve population health, we have
to understand the population."
 The Center for Population Studies is working with Volunteer Mississippi to
conduct a series of workshops across north Mississippi to help nonprofit
organizations use research to inform their strategic plans and grant proposals.
In early November, the center will host the State Data Center of Mississippi's
Annual Affiliates Meeting in collaboration with Planning and Development
Districts from around the state.



 To better understand issues faced by rural community and health development
professionals, the center's staff also met with representatives from the Aaron
E. Henry Community Health Center, Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi,
Delta Directions Consortium, Delta State University Center for Community and
Economic Development and DSU Delta Center for Culture and Learning, Green said.



 "Building on meetings held in Hernando, an interactive panel session was held
at the Coahoma County Higher Education Center in Clarksdale," he said.



 Sannie Snell, who runs the Right! from the Start maternal-child health program
and is a longtime partner of the center, said that it was natural that the
organization would gravitate toward the center.



 "The center has been beneficial, because it takes our ideas and frames them for
research and evaluation," Snell said. "It provides us the expertise needed to
develop evidence-based rural models of health care.



 "Collaborating with the center also brings in really bright students, who have
an interest in the work we're doing."
 The partnership creates a synergy between the university, students and the
community that will affect how Right! from the Start does community-focused
research in the future, she said.



 "This synergistic relationship is not only beneficial for my organization, but
also for building groups of future professionals, who understand the plight of
our population from a community level and, hopefully, can create more
patient-focused health care systems in the future," Snell said.



 Funded through a mixture of sources, including state-budgeted funds combined
with external grants and contracts from agencies and foundations in Mississippi
and nationally, the center has a long history.



 Through its affiliation with the State Data Center Program in conjunction with
the U.S. Census Bureau, the Center for Population Studies houses the State Data
Center of Mississippi, represents Mississippi in the Federal-State Cooperative
for Population Studies and works as liaison between diverse users of data and
the Census Bureau.



 Additionally, the center houses a program for community-based research through
which it works with nonprofit organizations across the state to assist them with
research design, data collection and analysis, especially for community
development and health-related initiatives.



 "This is our fifth and final year hosting the editorial office for the
peer-reviewed journal Community Development," Green said. "Published in
association with the Community Development Society and Routledge, Taylor &
Francis, this is an international publication focused on connecting research and
practice."

County Board of Health touts dental, injury prevention programs

BYLINE: Jason W. Brooks, Newton Daily News, Iowa

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 543 words


Sept. 09--If a picture is worth a thousand words, a thousand toothbrushes should
hopefully be worth at least a heightened awareness among Jasper County youth
about the importance of brushing.

That's the hope Jasper County Public Health Coordinator Lisa Damman has for a
new set of materials supplied by Delta Dental. Damman displayed some of the
1,000 toothbrushes -- of various sizes -- at Thursday's monthly Jasper County
Board of Health meeting, as well as books and other materials that could be used
for educating young people about dental health

"There are curriculums to follow for kindergarten through second grade, and one
for third through fifth grade," Damman said. "'Smart Smiles' is the name of the
program. There are books, an audio CD, a DVD and a model 'mouth' to use for
demonstration."

The Delta program was one of two recent programs discussed Thursday in which the
Jasper County Health Department has recently obtained resources. The other is
the Love Our Kid Injury Prevention Grant from the Iowa Department of Public
Health's Emergency Services Division, which will provide the JCHD with about
$2,000 to cover staffing and supplies to help child injuries.

The areas of prevention focus are suffocation, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome,
shaken baby, car seats, drowning and burns.

Another grant discussed at the meeting was funding sought in an effort to seek
recognition from the Public Health Accreditation Board. JCHD Director Becky
Pryor said she hasn't received notice yet as to whether the county has been
awarded the grant.

Home Care Manager Brenda Steenhoek received applause from both the three board
members present and others in announcing she completed 172 supervising visits
with home health care aides within the month of August.

"Now I can catch up on some things around the office," Steenhoek said.

In other action Thursday, the board:

-- Heard from Kevin Luetters, the county's environmental health director,
regarding recent developments. He said the amount of rabies cases is at an
expected level for this time of year. He also said he will miss working with
Laurie Jackson, whose position of GIS coordinator was recently eliminated by the
county Board of Supervisors, as she was helpful in coordinating many efforts.

-- Heard from board chair Margot Voshell regarding sidewalks. She noticed
recently some sidewalks in Newton have shifted in ways that create a large lip
that creates a tripping hazard, and speaking with City of Newton Public Works
Director Keith Laube revealed the city repairing every shifting sidewalk in the
city would be impractical. Businesses and homeowners are responsible for
repairing their own sidewalks in Newton.

-- Heard from Pryor regarding the Visiting Nurses of Iowa. She read a letter
from Stacy Jobs about VNS no longer provide maternal and child health services
in Jasper County as of Sept. 30 after six years of serving the county. Pryor
said the JCHD has looked into working Marion County on a contract, but that will
not be a viable option at this stage.

four-year musical scholarship to attend the University of Miami.

     Miss Still, the daughter of Dr. John L. and Pat Still of Dunedin,    was an
honor student and pipe major with the school's Highlander Band.

 She also has performed with the Pinellas Youth Symphony.

     She participated this summer in the Highland Games at Grandfather
Mountain in North Carolina, winning second-, third- and fourth-place    awards.

     As a member of the Dunedin City Pipe Corps, she will accompany that
group to a competition in California in September.

     "Music is Susan's love," said her mother. "She has been so    fortunate in
her teacher who was the principal oboist for the Chicago    Symphony. And the
University of Miami has an excellent oboe instructor.

 That was an important consideration for Susan."

Shop assists recovery of hospice group : And aid from the Delta Farmers
Institute means the society can continue to help the dying and their families.

Earlier this year it looked like the Delta Hospice Society would die on March 31
but it has since made a remarkable recovery.

"We were planning to close the doors because we couldn't continue operating with
the amount of money we were getting from the government," says society executive
director Nancy Macey.

The society received $ 60,000 from the province and had asked for an additional
$ 85,000 to cover the costs of training volunteers and providing professional
assistance to both families and volunteers.

The society had been operating since 1992 and earlier this year found it
couldn't cope with the demand for its services.

"There were only two of us and only 80 volunteers and it was overwhelming,"
Macey says.

The request for more money was ignored and so the board took the decision to
cease offering services.

"But we were saved for this year by a one-off grant of $ 50,000 from the Delta
Farmers Institute," she says.

That kept the society together until someone came up with the idea of opening a
thrift shop in the Tsawwassen Town Centre Mall.

And this has been so successful as a supplement to the provincial grant that
it's given a measure of financial security to the cash-strapped society that
last year helped 250 families deal with the pain of death and bereavement.

"It's been quite a little miracle and it looks like it will enable us to
continue. But the only drawback is that now we're into the retail business
instead of just the death and dying business, so it's been a bitter-sweet
experience," says Macey.

It's also forced the society to recruit volunteers to run a store and now has 80
people involved in collecting and selling donated items.

In all the society has 200 volunteers, with 120 of them trained to help dying
people as well as their families.

Their services are available for persons dying at home with their families, in
hospital or acute- and long-term-care facilities.

"Families are often burnt out looking after someone who is dying for 24-hours a
day. We help them through it. If necessary, we'll hold a 72-hour vigil with a
dying person to help them die with dignity and not be alone," says Macey.

"Society in general is a death-denying society that doesn't want to deal with
death. Our job is to raise the public's awareness that people need to be helped
through this -- the person dying and their family -- it really amounts to people
helping people," she says.

The hospice society offers emotional support, respite relief for family members,
group-counselling sessions for children and adults, and will help the dying make
audio tapes for their families, recording their stories, memories and
experiences.

"We had a young man who was dying and we helped him leave a message for his
daughter. These things can mean a great deal to people," says Macey.

This year the Tsawwassen Canada Safeway store has chosen the society for its
annual employees' fund-raising campaign, and has set a goal of $ 5,000 for its
135 employees.

Manager David McComb has promised to get his head shaved if they reach it by the
end of the month.

"I think they're not telling me how much they've raised but they seem to think
they can do it," he said.

The society hopes to raise more than $ 20,000 from its annual Christmas Tree
campaign, in which businesses pay $ 1,200 to have a tree erected in the
municipal hall rotunda, which is then decorated by company employees.

As advocates for the dying and their families, Macey said the society is
concerned that there isn't a palliative-care unit in Delta Hospital or a
physician specially trained in pain and symptom management practicing locally.

"There are such units in Surrey and White Rock hospitals, but they haven't made
the money available for one here," says Macey.

"And the doctors do their best to relieve pain but we don't really have anyone
here who specializes in it.

"Having these resources is a priority with us," she says.

At the end of September, the society will hold a training session for volunteers
who want to work with the dying.

Macey said the society is also seeking volunteers for its thrift shop. Persons
who wish to volunteer can call the society at 948-0660.

Infant Welfare Clinic seeks grant to meet increased needs

BYLINE: Steve Schering, Pioneer Press Newspapers, Suburban Chicago

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 620 words


June 25--As the Oak Park River Forest Infant Welfare Society Children's Clinic
looks after the area's most needy patients, the clinic still hopes it can offer
even more.

The clinic is one of three organizations in the running for a $100,000 grant
offered by the Delta Dental Foundation, and clinic officials have big plans for
the award if they are the lucky recipients.

In addition to providing health services, the clinic, located at 320 Lake St. in
Oak Park, offers its patients dental and behavioral health services as well.

Clinic officials hope to use the money to construct a dental quiet room for
children with special needs who may become agitated by the noise in the open-bay
exam rooms.

"We see a lot of children with autism," said Executive Director Elizabeth
Lippitt. "The open bay wasn't totally meeting those children's needs. It was too
much distraction."

Lippitt said a local donor has offered his services to design and develop the
project to cater specifically to special needs children needing any type of
dental care.

"We're designing the lighting and colors of the room to create a calming
environment for the kids," Lippitt said.

Founded in 1916, the Infant Welfare Society began its existence by providing
clean milk for infants in the Chicago area. The Oak Park River Forest Infant
Welfare Society hired its first social worker in the 1920s and began offering
dental services in the 1970s.

"They realized so many of these children have little access to good dental
care," Lippitt said. "We see close to 2,000 children in 6,000 visits per year on
the dental side. At the clinic, we have children come in with rampant decay."

Lippitt said the clinic serves patients from Oak Park, River Forest, Forest
Park, Berwyn, Cicero, the Austin neighborhood and many others.

"We serve over 50 communities in the Chicagoland area," said Katie O'Brien, the
clinic's marketing and communications manager. "[Our patients] have limited
access to healthcare in this area. Overall, the clinic serves over 3,200
children in 10,000 visits each year."

Earlier this year, Lippitt said a 2-year-old patient had decay on all 20 teeth,
which required the child to be taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center in
Chicago to be operated on.

The clinic relies heavily on donations, fundraising and partnerships like the
one with Illinois Masonic to treat its patients, and is hopeful the Delta
Foundation's Wisdom Tooth Award will bring even more services to the patients.

"The grant would also pay for more hours for our pediatric dentist," Lippitt
said. "All of our dentists work great with the kids, but it's really helpful to
work with a pediatric dentist who has worked with high needs children."

In addition to providing high-quality, low-cost medical care, the clinic
provides education to families to ensure children lead lives full of healthy
habits.

"There's not many places to get really high quality dental care for kids,"
Lippitt said. "We're only here because of all the support we get from the local
community. We could not do it without them."

Residents can help the Infant Welfare Society Clinic win the grant award by
"liking" the Oak Park River Forest Infant Welfare Society's proposal on the
Delta Dental Foundation's Facebook page at
http://www.facebook.com/deltadentalil.

As the Clinic prepares for its 100th anniversary, staff is eagerly awaiting the
results when voting ends on June 26.

"It would be great to have the grant, do the work and kick-off our 100th year
with such great news," O'Brien said.

Homeowners. Residential mortgage loan delinquencies in metro Atlanta ---
borrowers 60 or more days past due --- declined in the first quarter of 2011,
according to TransUnion. About 8 percent of Atlanta's mortgages were 60 or more
days overdue, compared with 9 percent one year earlier. However, delinquencies
here were still higher than the national average of 6.2 percent.

Drivers. After a big run-up, gas prices are falling. About one week after gas in
Atlanta topped the $4-a-gallon mark, the average price for regular dropped to
about $3.91 on Friday, according to AAA. Prices should continue to drop, by as
much as 50 cents a gallon during the summer, said Fred Rozell, director of
pricing for New Jersey-based Oil Price Information Service.

Savannah College of Art and Design students. The college is partnering with ELLE
magazine for the first time to feature fashion designs by students in the
October and December issues, it was reported last week. Their work also will be
featured in a runway show in New York during Fashion Week in September. Students
selected for the show can win $25,000 in grant money for winning the ELLE Design
Award or $10,000 for winning the People's Choice Award on ELLE.com.

It was a bad week for . . .

Newt Gingrich. The former House speaker's presidential bid is off to a rough
start, some critics said last week. The Georgian disparaged House Republicans'
Medicare proposal as "right-wing social engineering" and defended part of the
Democrats' health care law. He also refused to explain a $500,000 debt he once
owed to the Tiffany's jewelry store. "He has severely damaged his campaign and
his credibility," said Debbie Dooley of Duluth, a national coordinator for the
Tea Party Patriots. Gingrich said he'll continue on with "cheerful persistence"
and advisers said he won't be changing anything about his campaign.

Delta. The Atlanta-based airline is cutting trans-Atlantic flight capacity by 10
to 12 percent after Labor Day, saying it needs to adjust to higher fuel costs
and declines in demand. The reduction is part of a collection of moves by Delta
to cut back. The carrier previously announced that it will reduce flight
capacity systemwide by 4 percent after Labor Day compared with the same period
of last year. Additionally, Delta announced it will offer buyouts and early
retirements to cut its workforce.

Home Depot. The home-improvement company said bad winter weather led to an
overall decrease in same-store sales of 0.7 percent at U.S. stores in April.
Overall sales of $16.82 billion in the company's first quarter were down 0.2
percent from sales of $16.86 billion in last year's first quarter. Spring is
Home Depot's busiest selling season, with 30 percent of its business in the
first quarter coming from garden and other seasonal categories, Executive Vice
President of Merchandising Craig Menear said.

SPDC, Others to Enhance Health Care Delivery in Niger Delta

BYLINE: Sunday Okobi And Ibrahim Qudus

LENGTH: 466 words


Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) in collaboration with the governments
of Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Imo, Abia and AkwaIbom States and New Partnership for
Africa Development (NEPAD) is set to improve health care delivery system in
Niger Delta through the training of 300 midwives.

The training in the region is to support government's effort in getting more
skilled health workers to rural communities.

The 18-month midwifery certification training which commenced in 2014, according
to a statement signed by Shell spokesperson, BamideleOlugbengaOdugbesan, is
aimed at producing skilled and motivated change agents in the hinterland.

According to the statement, the SPDC acting Regional Community Health Manager,
Dr. AkinwumiFajola, during a cheque presentation ceremony in Port Harcourt,
said: "This is a unique intervention that invests not only in the individual
beneficiaries but also in the people hoping to benefit from their newly acquired
skills. "The training is in line with SPDC's commitment to improving healthcare
in rural areas and will make the much-needed difference in hard-to-reach
locations in the Delta."

SPDC's acting Head of Department, Partnership and Collaboration, Dr. Dennis
Oyakhire, also commended the state ministry of health for its commitment to the
success of the partnership and initiatives.

He said: "In 2014, the beneficiaries received the first installment of the
scholarship fund and today we are happy to be presenting the second and final
cheque to the trainees. We are all looking forward to enjoying the benefits of
this initiative." The Director of Nursing Services of the Abia State Ministry of
Health, Ekeagba Promise, thanked SPDC for training the midwives.

In addition, the 300 trainees are also studying in accredited state schools of
midwifery and are also sent on clinical attachments in community hospitals, "all
with a view to prepare them for the final qualifying examination of The Nigerian
Nursing and Midwifery Council. SPDC has provided them with modern laptops to
facilitate research and documentation," the statement said.

Faith Emerho, one of the beneficiaries from the Delta State School of Nursing,
Sapele, said: "I was struggling through school; combining school with work until
SPDC provided finances that enabled me resume my studies. I promise to be an
agent of change in my community."

She and the other midwives are expected to graduate this year and return to
their communities to provide professional medical care.

The statement explained that SPDC has supported community health projects in the
Niger Delta since 1980s, with equipment and pharmaceutical donations as well as
the construction of hospitals and implementation of malaria and HIV/AIDs control
programmes. At present, the SPDC supports 20 health centres in the region.

2,250 Indigent Households to Enjoy CCT Scheme in Delta

BYLINE: Kola Niyi-Eke

LENGTH: 262 words


No fewer than 2,250 extreme poor and vulnerable indigent households in Delta
State are to benefit from the conditional cash transfer disbursement (CCT)
scheme.

The state commissioner for special duties and millennium development goals,
Queen Victoria Ikechukwu at a media briefing over the weekend disclosed that the
CCT programme was a partnership programme between the state and federal
government, adding that the programme was aimed at

providing grants to extremely poor households so that they could keep their
children and wards of basic school age in school.

While saying that the programme was designed to increase enrolment rate in
school and access to healthcare services, the commissioner noted that the scheme
was targeted at extremely poor households which have children between age 0 to
15, pregnant women and the vulnerable.

The commissioner further disclosed that the CCT programme was a social safety
net being implemented in 24 states.

She said that Delta State had 2,250 households from five local government areas
earmarked for the programme including 50 Eku ex-lepers identified and registered
for the scheme, using the MDGs poverty index.

The commissioner listed the five councils for the CCT scheme to include Udu,
Ukwani, Oshimili South, Okpe, and Warri South West, adding that it was evidence
of government's commitment to improve lives of the poor in the society.

She said, "This initiative is aimed at goal one, reducing extreme poverty by
half before 2015, achieving human capital development, one of the three point
agenda of Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan."

Medical student presented 2014 Excellence in Public Health Award

LENGTH: 636  words

DATELINE: Honolulu


University of Hawai'i has issued the following news release:

John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) second-year medical student Brandyn
Dunn was presented with 2014 Excellence in Public Health Award at the Fourth
Annual Distinguished Lecture and Induction Ceremony at UH M[#x101]noa.

The award recognizes medical students who show their dedication to public health
by making exceptional contributions to the community through [#x200b]U.S. health
[#x200b]initiatives, including[#x200b][#x200b] Healthy People 2020 and the
National Prevention Strategy. [#x200b]

The award was created by the the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) to
inspire medical students to commit themselves to public health and to become
leaders in the field.

Each year, every U.S. medical school is able to nominate one student who has
worked hard to increase awareness about health care and put that knowledge into
action.

This year, Dunn was recognized for his commitment to public health as the
volunteer coordinator of Hui Ola Pono, a public health student organization.  He
also co-founded Teen Health Camp Hawai`i, a program that has helped more than
500 disadvantaged high school students overcome academic struggles and seek
mentors in higher education in public health and medicine, and consider
health-focused careers.

"Along with Teresa Schiff (fourth-year medical student) and Eduardo Duquez
(JABSOM Alumni '13), I established Teen Health Camp Hawai`i in 2009 to inspire
local students to enter the field of health care and hopefully help combat our
state's terrifying shortage in health-care workers," said Dunn.  "Teen Health
Camp Hawai`i is a motivational career-oriented program targeted at
underrepresented middle and high school students in rural Hawai`i. This program
is designed to attract minority students to health-care careers through fun and
interactive workshops in health-care training, while also teaching students
about opportunities and options in higher education," said Dunn.

Dunn, who is the MD Class of 2016 President, earned his Master's in Public
Health (MPH) in Epidemiology at the UHM in 2011, and was inducted into the
Hawai`i Delta Omega Society that same year. Apart from receiving the 2014
Excellence in Public Health Award, Dunn was honored with the Koseki Award for
Excellence in Community Service during his MPH studies and the 2013 American
Heart Association Student Scholarship in Cardiovascular Disease for his research
efforts at the medical school.

Dunn counts among his mentors Public Health Studies Professor Alan Katz, whom he
worked closely with during his MPH studies.

Dr. Katz described some of Dunn's work in the nomination paper he transmitted to
the public health service.  "Mr. Dunn's final project for his MPH degree was an
ambitious survey of hospital and community-based health professionals in Hawai`i
on the topic of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections,"
Dr. Katz wrote.

"Working closely with his practicum advisor, the late Dr. Alan Tice, a professor
at our School of Medicine and an infectious disease specialist, he developed and
pilot tested a survey tool which addressed knowledge of the epidemiology of MRSA
and attitudes towards antibiotic resistance. He then distributed the survey on
line, analyzed and interpreted the findings, and published his findings in the
Hawai`i Journal of Medicine and Public Health," Katz said.

Dunn expressed his gratitude to Dr. Katz and to JABSOM's Dean. "I would not have
been able to receive this (Excellence in Public Health) award without the
support from the JABSOM faculty, specifically Dr. Katz and Dean
[#x200b]Jerris[#x200b] Hedges, who ultimately nominated me for this award," said
Dunn.

The Distinguished Lecture and Induction Ceremony was sponsored by the Hawai`i
Delta Omega Society on April 8, 2014.

Washington: $1 Billion Invested in Rural Health Care Across 13 States

LENGTH: 555  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Department of Health and Human Services has issued the following News
release:

In late 2011, the President announced a White House Rural Council initiative
lead by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and US Department
of Agriculture (USDA) to invest in rural health and link rural doctors and
hospitals to financing for health IT. The initiative was designed to address the
need for financing to support the adoption of health IT systems in rural
communities. Financing has been cited as one of the top challenges for rural
doctors and hospitals serving remote and poor communities.

Between 2012 and 2014, the HHS and USDA led initiative generated approximately
$1 Billion in rural health care financing across 13 states. These investments,
funded by USDA, included grants and loans to help rural clinics and hospitals
transition from paper to electronic health records (EHRs), encourage exchange of
health information with health care providers and patients, and offer telehealth
services.

Since it launched in 2012, the initiative has expanded access to financing for
rural health care needs through cross-government collaboration and partnerships
with non-Government organizations--including bringing together diverse teams to
achieve common goals and using existing programs in innovative ways.

Collaborative Rural Health Financing Initiative

Beginning in 2012, HHS and USDA launched a series of activities to link rural
communities to funding from USDA Rural Development financing assistance
programs, including the Community Facilities grant and loan programs, the Rural
Economic Development Loan and Grant (REDLG) program and the Distance Learning
and Telemedicine (DLT) grant program. See our joint blog posting about how Rural
Development invested $8.6 Million in DLT grants for rural health care related
projects in 2014.

Other key partners joined the effort to offer financing assistance. For example,
the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) made available a new Rural Health IT Loan
Fund to help health care providers across eight states. Through this initiative,
DRA offered interest free loans to small practices, particularly physicians and
dentists in underserved areas to assist with adoption and meaningful use of
EHRs. In addition, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) funded rural health
IT projects.

Local, non-Federal partners (i.e., rural electric cooperatives, rural telephone
cooperatives, and municipal utilities) also engaged in support of rural health
care and health IT. These organizations passed along Federal funds, REDLG
program funds that only they may access directly, to clinics and hospitals in
the form of a zero percent loan over ten years.

Importantly, we began convening state-specific, in-person workshops to bring
Government and non-Government partners to the table with health care providers
to find creative solutions for challenges that rural and poor communities face
accessing financing for rural health care and rural health IT. By the end of
2014, we convened workshops to reach doctors, clinics and hospitals in each of
13 states: Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Michigan,
Minnesota, Tennessee, Missouri, Montana, Wyoming and Kentucky.

Helping treat the Mississippi Delta's ailments

BYLINE: Wally Northway

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 805  words


Among the myriad of challenges faced by those in the Mississippi Delta, arguably
none are more of a problem than access to adequate, affordable healthcare. If
the 18 Delta counties (excluding DeSoto County) were removed from the state's
numbers, Mississippi would rank average or near average in almost all major
health indicators.

Of course, those counties cannot be removed, or ignored, and it is the mission
of the Delta Health Alliance (DHA) to boost the area through increasing access
to healthcare, improving health education and conducting research.

Founded in 2001 as a 501(c)3, the DHA is a partnership between four institutions
of higher learning - Delta State University, Mississippi State University,
Mississippi Valley Sate University, University of Mississippi Medical Center
-and the Delta Council.

"I really believe that healthcare is the economic engine that drives
communities," said Karen Fox, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of
Stoneville-based DHA.

Fox said lack of accessible, quality healthcare affects businesses' bottom line.
Foregoing preventative care means longer recovery periods and more lost time for
Delta workers. Having to drive to find care only adds to that lost time.

Thus, DHA's work should be of utmost importance to the Delta business community.
And DHA relies heavily on the business leaders.

"The business community is crucial to our work," Fox said. "Every community is
different. The first thing we do when we go into a community is talk with its
leaders, which includes business leaders, to see where we are and where we need
to go. "

DHA is not a grant-awarding group. Rather it works with its partners through
cooperative agreements to develop sustainable programs that meet critical
healthcare needs of the region, write proposals and identify funding
opportunities, implement initiatives and evaluate their results.

The DHA lists dozens of projects in which it is involved, and these efforts are
wide ranging. Past and present projects run the gamut from increasing the number
and quality of nurses in the region to HIV testing to the use of electronic
health records.

One of DHA's newer projects has Fox and her team excited. The Delta Promise
Community Project was announced last summer after DHA went to New York to
observe the community-based initiative the Harlem Children's Zone. Geoffrey
Canada founded the Harlem Children's Zone in 1970 originally as an anti-truancy
program. It has since expanded its reach, and today provides coordinated
services in such areas as healthcare, literacy, early childhood development and
social services that have proven successful in reversing national trends of
at-risk minorities.

The DHA is looking to replicate that program in the Delta in the City of
Indianola. The organization hopes the Delta Promise Community Project
accomplishes a number of objectives including adult literacy and job training,
charter schools and redesigned curricula and college assistance programs, among
others.

Fox said this type of program might seem out of the norm for DHA. But, once
again DHA looks at communities as a whole. The needs in the Delta are so great
and healthcare issues so intertwined with other challenges that she believes the
Promise program holds great potential for the region.

DHA plans on taking the program to other Delta communities. In fact, some of the
components of the Promise program have already been established outside of
Indianola.

DHA has grown significantly over the years. At one point employing a staff of
two, today the organization now has a payroll of 50 workers.

One reason for the increase in staff is DHA's extensive research. Rather than
just throwing money at programs it hopes will be effective, DHA evaluates each
of its projects. If they are successful, full support is afforded. If the
program's results are found to be less than expected, the program is tweaked or
dropped. It is all about results.

This all has Fox enthused about DHA's future. The organization will certainly
benefit from Fox's leadership. A native of Fulton, she originally studied
engineering, earning her undergraduate degree from the University of
Mississippi. Fox would subsequently earn her MBA from the University of Memphis
and her Ph.D. in health sciences from the University of Tennessee. She spent 20
years with the University of Tennessee's Health Science Center in Memphis, and
served as vice chancellor of the center.

"We obviously want to conduct as many projects in as many communities as
possible," Fox said. "It is going to take some patience. We have to measure and
document what works. It has taken the Harlem Children's Zone 20 years or so to
see results because that's how long it has taken for the children to grow up. My
hope is 20 years from now, we look back and can say we improved the communities
in the Delta. "

Where's east Contra Costa health care district's money going?

BYLINE: By Rick Radin Contra Costa Times

LENGTH: 826 words


PITTSBURG -- East Contra Costa's only taxpayer-supported health care district is
proposing to spend less than half its budget this fiscal year on the community
programs it was set up to support, just a year after a civil grand jury
criticized it for not directing more money toward serving residents.

The rest of the 2011-12 budget would go toward district expenses such as
employee wages and board compensation, legal services and strategic planning.

The Los Medanos Community Healthcare District is budgeting $405,422 for its own
expenses compared with $325,879 on grants to community nonprofits and an
eyeglass program for needy schoolchildren.

The district is proposing to spend $164,000 on wages in 2011-12, including a
$100,000 annual salary for Administrator Bobbie Palmer, who has moved from part
time to full time. That is roughly double what it spent on district wages last
year.

Palmer was formerly receiving $48,000 a year for a 20-hour-a-week position.

Palmer declined to comment on the budget, including questions about her salary
and a plan to spend $4,500 to buy Apple iPads for each board member so they can
communicate with each other.

"Somebody just said 'I want an iPad, how about the rest of you guys?' " said Joe
Rubi, a former board member and a longtime critic of the current board. "They
already have email, home phones and cellphones, so why do they need iPads?
That's a luxury item."

The district was the subject of a 2010 civil grand jury report that criticized
trustees for spending an average of half of its revenue from 2006 to 2009 on
community programs.

In response to the report, the district produced a balance sheet that showed it
spent about 69 percent of its budget on programs during those years.

The district has budgeted 44 percent of revenues on programs this year, compared
with 49 percent last year. About 73 percent of district residents are in
Pittsburg, 22 percent in Bay Point and close to 5 percent in four other
communities. The district is funded through a 1 percent property tax assessment.
A recent grand jury report also criticized the Mount Diablo Healthcare District,
a similar special district, for spending only 10 percent on programs out of the
$2.45 million it collected from 2000 to 2009.

Los Medanos board member Eva Zendejas Vera said Palmer's position has always
been full time, but she's been paid a half-time salary in the past.

The five board members will continue to receive about $4,800 each in annual
stipends for attending two meetings a month. Vera said the district has been
struggling with a loss of property tax revenue. Los Medanos had more than $1
million in revenues in 2007-08 and 2008-09 compared with $731,400 in 2011-12.

"We get our money from property tax, but our expenses have stayed the same,"
Vera said.

Board members Marilyn Condit, Linda Strong, Vern Cromartie and board President
Darnell Turner did not respond to requests for comment on the district's
spending.

"(Board members) are doing all they can to not say anything about what's going
on," Rubi said. "If you challenge them, they just get mad and chew you out."

The board is scheduled to discuss the budget at Monday's meeting.

"This shows a very cavalier attitude toward the people's money," said Kris Hunt,
of the Contra Costa Taxpayers' Association, which had a representative at the
district's July 18 budget meeting. "This (assessment) is an item that's hidden
away on the property tax bill."

Among the 16 nonprofit groups receiving annual funding are Delta Memorial
Hospital Foundation, Delta 2000/Bay Point All-Star Cheerleading and East County
Midnight Basketball.

The largest beneficiary in 2010-11 was John Muir Community Health Alliance,
which received $146,222 to provide blood pressure and diabetes checks for
minority residents and information about health care options.

Vera acknowledged that "two or three" of the nonprofits have not returned
required documentation verifying that they have spent the money as intended.

"They're not doing their program, obviously," Vera said. "We would like them to
return the money."

Despite the criticisms, incumbents Condit and Vera were re-elected in November.
Strong was the only challenger to win a seat.

Three other challengers, including Rubi, were defeated.

Breast Care Center director emphasizes early detection

BYLINE: Casey Murphy, Tyler Morning Telegraph, Texas

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 715 words


Oct. 29--Regina Davis believes Breast Cancer Awareness shouldn't just be for the
month of October.

As director of the East Texas Medical Center Breast Care Center, Mrs. Davis said
throughout Breast Cancer Awareness Month, she continues to encourage women 40
and older to get annual screening mammograms. Early detection is "key" to
combating breast cancer, which she said is the second most common cancer in
women and a disease one in eight women will see in their lifetime.

The ETMC Breast Care Center provides a full range of services for screening and
early detection of breast cancer.

Mrs. Davis, 56, said it is important for women to start getting annual
screenings at age 40 and to not skip a year so radiologists can compare the
tests every year, follow up on any differences they see and catch any cancer
early.

The Breast Care Center offers a discount to patients who pay cash for mammograms
and Mrs. Davis said they are committed to women being able to afford the
screenings. She said the Susan G. Komen Foundation provides grants for the
mammograms based on family size and income.

Mrs. Davis also coordinates an outreach program, East Texas Pin-A-Sister, which
encourages black women to receive their screening annually. She said the
organization, made up of women volunteers in the community, focuses primarily on
Smith County but will reach out to other counties as well.

Pin-A-Sister is a faith-based breast cancer awareness program that began in
2010. Since then, 3,500 women have participated in pinning ceremonies and
received health information on the importance of obtaining an annual screening
mammogram, according to www.etmc.org.

For Breast Cancer Awareness month, ETMC Breast Care Center has partnered with
other local programs and participated in events, such as Turn Tyler Pink. She
said they held the sixth Pink Ribbon Getaway for cancer survivors Oct. 6.

What Mrs. Davis likes most about her work is the dedication of the staff with
whom she works, she said. She enjoys working with a group who together have
decades of experience, yet treat everyday like a new day.

Mrs. Davis has been in the health care administration industry for 30 years.

She grew up in Kilgore and attended North Texas State University, where she
earned a master's degree in audiology. She moved around the country, living in
the Appalachian Mountains and the Delta of Alabama working in hospital
administration, mostly in rural health.

Five years after earning her first master's degree in audiology, she went back
to school, earning a second master's degree in health care administration from
Texas Woman's University Houston Center.

After she and her husband of 26 years, Jim Davis, had their now 21-year-old
daughter, Mrs. Davis said she felt it was time to move back home. Since moving
to Tyler, she worked for Trinity Mother Frances Hospitals & Clinics for seven
years and The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler for five years,
doing physician practice management at both institutions.

For four years, she has served as director of the ETMC Breast Care Center. Mrs.
Davis' duties include marketing, being in charge of the mobile mammography unit,
managing the clinic and coordinating services, she said.

"I always enjoyed doing programs and I always enjoyed working with people, just
beyond the one-on-one patient," she said of why she chose her profession. "And
also I thought I could make a difference in terms of not only how well the
clinic ran or functioned but in terms of outreaching to ... underserved
populations in terms of getting them into primary care and into a regular system
of health care."

When she is not working, Mrs. Davis' passion is container gardening. Known as
"plant lady" by the neighborhood children, she said she has more than 200
container gardens, mostly made up of flowering plants.

Mrs. Davis is also active in the community. She is going through the current
Leadership Tyler class and is a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.

SIU School of Dental Medicine Students Recognized by Delta Dental of Illinois

LENGTH: 366  words

DATELINE: Edwardsville


Southern Illinois University Edwardsville has issued the following news release:

Two Southern Illinois University School of Dental Medicine (SIU SDM) students
have been awarded $2,500 grants respectively from Delta Dental of Illinois for
their commitment to improve oral health in Illinois.

The non-profit dental service corporation honored Sarah Tien, of Darien, and
Ashley McNealy, of Alton, through its 2015 student grants program. Tien and
McNealy earned doctor of dental medicine degrees at the SDM commencement
Saturday, June 6.

"Sarah Tien and Ashley McNealy are both bright students and certainly deserving
of this distinguished award from Delta Dental of Illinois," said Dr. Rotter.
"Sarah, Ashley and all the graduates of the Class of 2015 are extremely capable
and well trained dentists who will unquestionably have a positive impact on the
communities they serve."

Upon graduation, Tien plans to provide dental care to underserved populations.
McNealy plans to practice in Elgin, and is especially interested in using her
Spanish language skills to treat the Hispanic population.

Through the grant program, Delta Dental of Illinois provides educational and
financial support to two graduating students from the SIU SDM annually. To be
eligible for the award students must:

Pass their National Boards
    Be in the top 25 percent of their class
    Plan to practice in Illinois
    Participate in community outreach activities
    Declare interest in the advanced pediatric dentistry specialty

The SIU School of Dental Medicine students manage approximately 35,000 patient
visits each year at its patient clinics in Alton and East St. Louis. In
addition, students offer oral health treatment, screenings and education to more
than 10,000 people annually through a wide variety of off-campus community
outreach events. These opportunities provide students the training they need to
graduate and become highly skilled dentists. The School of Dental Medicine is a
vital oral health care provider for residents of southern and central Illinois,
and the St. Louis metropolitan region.

Supervisors reflect on new year

BYLINE: By Rick Radin Contra Costa Times

SECTION: MY TOWN; Contra Costa; News; Local

LENGTH: 923 words


County supervisors' major concern in the coming year will be to work with county
Administrator David Twa to cope with the state budget meltdown. They also have
their own priorities for 2010:

John Gioia, District 1

Gioia wants to promote more partnerships linking the county and cities and
nonprofits to help in law enforcement, health care and the development of youth
centers.

One of his objectives in his West Contra Costa district, where crime is an
issue, is re-entry reform to help people on parole and probation find help with
jobs, health care and housing.

"These kinds of programs lower the recidivism rate," he said.

He also favors eliminating ineffective programs. For example, the county
inspects rental housing units regularly even through 90 percent of the time
inspectors find no code violations. It may be more cost effective to respond
only to complaints, he said.

"Does it make sense to inspect everything when only a few properties aren't in
compliance?" he asked.

Gayle Uilkema, District 2

Uilkema, a former Lafayette mayor, says cities can share in the cost of
prosecuting misdemeanors, taking some of the load off a depleted staff of county
prosecutors. After the District Attorney's Office said it could no longer
prosecute many misdemeanors last year, supervisors agreed to use reserves to
hire more attorneys.

"The cities could have stepped up to do that," she said. "There are creative
ways to address these kinds of partnerships. We've done it with the libraries."

Uilkema wants to limit employee pension costs by negotiating higher
contributions from employees and lowering benefits for new hires.

"We're risking that the county is going to be spending all its money on
pensions," she said. "We've capped our health care costs, now we need to shine a
light on pensions."

Mary Piepho, District 3

Piepho lives in Discovery Bay and is especially interested in issues that affect
communities in the far East County part of her sprawling district. She has
actively lobbied for the county's interests at the state level over preservation
of the Delta and over the threat she sees in a proposed peripheral canal.

"My priority will continue to be water," Piepho said. "The state's Delta policy
package is poised to devastate the Delta."

Piepho has promoted increased safety along Vasco Road and is trying to extend a
barrier along a critical stretch to reduce head-on collisions.

Piepho wants to cut costs by reducing the county's support for retiree health
care and pensions. Other savings can come through negotiations with county
unions, she said.

"There should be no guarantee of retiree health care for new employees and we
need changes to pensions," she said.

Piepho wants to identify basic levels of service in the sheriff's and fire
departments, ambulance service, road maintenance and the county hospital to use
as guidelines for budget cuts.

Susan Bonilla, District 4

Bonilla says communication can help people cope with the budget cuts that are
coming.

For example, she wants the county to let the nonprofit contractors who help
provide welfare services, such as aid to new mothers or homeless shelters, know
sooner than in the past if funding cuts are on the way.

"We want to give these community-based organizations a larger window of
opportunity to see if they can find the money elsewhere," she said. "When there
is money, no one feels the same need to communicate."

She also wants to expand outreach to attract businesses to Contra Costa by
identifying and promoting sites to companies that are considering a move. The
county recently lured AAA, with 1,000 employees, from San Francisco to Walnut
Creek.

"We are going to be proactive in trying to attract businesses," she said.

Federal Glover, District 5

Glover says his constituents are most concerned about the mortgage crisis, code
violations and law enforcement. His district has been hit hard by foreclosures
and neglect of abandoned properties. He also hears complaints about commuting
and rush-hour traffic jams on Highway 4.

"I want to improve delivery of services, such as health care, financial and food
assistance, cleaning up abandoned properties and illegal dumping," he said.

For example, Glover's office is applying for grants to buy a camera system to
monitor Bay Point sites where illegal roadside dumping occurs.

Glover says cooperation among county agencies and nonprofit groups can help save
money. He said the county health department is meeting with nonprofit clinics to
eliminate duplication of service.

Job development is key to solving a number of problems, Glover said. He wants to
help develop more programs in which community colleges work with private
businesses to teach key skills. He helped create a program at Los Medanos
College to train technicians who are being hired to work in oil refinery control
rooms.

"If you don't make that original investment in finding a job for someone, or
getting them job training or helping them get over a financial hump while they
transition, we as a community will end up paying for it later," Glover said.The

Mobile dental clinic brings Porterville native home: Site: Visit took place at
school in Goshen.

BYLINE: Glen Faison, The Porterville Recorder, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 715 words


May 30--GOSHEN -- A Porterville native returned to the Valley this week to learn
his professions and to boost the overall health of nearly 100 children.

Chad Gibson is a student at the University of Southern California Dental Science
Center, studying to become a dentist.

The program's mobile dental clinic -- consisting of a converted RV and four
fifth-wheel trailers -- rolled into Goshen May 22 and spent the week evaluating
and treating children at Goshen Elementary School.

For Gibson, this week's work in Goshen represents a new beginning in his
educational journey.

As a new senior, he and his classmates are taking over cases from graduating
seniors. That transition occurred Tuesday, when Gibson arrived in Goshen for the
clinic that began the previous Friday.

"We're taking over the care of the patients for the next year," he said Friday
while working with one of the last young patients of the day.

Dr. Marjorie Domingo, director of the mobile clinic operation, called the this
week's transition "a really exciting time" of Gibson's education.

The Goshen stop was one of Gibson's first clinics, she said.

The week's work in Goshen was a homecoming of sorts for Gibson, who attended Oak
Grove Elementary and Burton Middle schools, Monache High and Fresno State before
heading off to USC.

His ties to the area, however, had nothing to do with his assignments in Goshen.
Gibson said it was the luck of the draw that brought him home to the Central
Valley.

"This set of trailers moves all over California, and each week they stop at a
different location with 15 students each time. This is the farthest north that
we come," he said. "We don't have control over which location we go to. It's
assigned to us. So it's kind of neat that I got to come so close to
Porterville."

Domingo said having a Valley native on board helps to ease the group into the
work.

"He's been our little ambassador here," she said.

Domingo said the mobile clinic sees 1,300 to 1,400 patients each academic year
-- about 100 at each of the 13 to 14 stops it makes in communities as far north
as Tulare County and as far south as San Diego. Combined, the mobile clinics
account for approximately 5,000 dental appointments a year.

"Those are appointments that don't exist in a community," she said.

The mobile clinic provides what Gibson describes as full mouth care, everything
from sealants to fillings, extractions to cleaning and fluoride treatments.
There's also a heavy dose of education centering on oral hygiene and prevention.

This was the USC program's 14th year in Tulare County working in collaboration
with the Kaweah Delta Health Care District.

Domingo said each 10-day rotation costs between $52,000 and $57,000 -- paid for
by partnerships, donations and grants. The Tulare County stops come at a reduced
cost, due to the long-standing relationship between USC and Kaweah Delta,
Domingo said -- an even $50,000.

Gwendolyn Bibb, director of community outreach for the health care district,
detailed the financial backing that allowed for the Tulare County clinic:

Ã[#x2039]Â[#x203a] California Health Care Foundation of Oakland -- $20,000.

Ã[#x2039]Â[#x203a] Kaweah Delta Hospital Foundation -- $20,000.

Ã[#x2039]Â[#x203a] Gannett, owner of the Visalia Times-Delta and the Tulare
Advance-Register -- $1,000.

Bibb said the remaining $9,000 was covered by the hospital district.

"Our primary goal here is education, and that's the creation of a health care
professional who has a passion for providing care to non-traditional patients in
non-traditional settings, as well as in 90210," Domingo said. "Our hope is, not
just Chad, but all our students would consider a place like Goshen, Cutler,
Ivanhoe, Orosi -- or Porterville -- to practice."

Gibson said he intends top do just that: He said once he graduates, he plans to
practice in Porterville.

Health Centers See Threat From 'Private Option' Medicaid

LENGTH: 1181  words


In this sleepy Mississippi River Delta town in eastern Arkansas, the community
health center that opened in 2012 stands out among the downtown's mostly
abandoned buildings constructed over a half century earlier.
The 15,000 square-foot brick building with its two-story lobby and green awnings
was paid for through a $2.8 million grant from the Affordable Care Act - a
federal investment designed to ensure the nonprofit clinic could treat hundreds
of additional patients, many of whom would gain health coverage under Obamacare.

 Now, though, Mid-Delta Health Systems is worried it won't have enough money to
maintain services to low-income patients because of how the state is expanding
Medicaid.
Arkansas' "private option" model is putting newly eligible recipients into the
same private plans that any consumer might buy in the health law's online
insurance marketplaces. And private insurers pay the community centers far less
than they have received from traditional Medicaid - in Clarendon, less than half
as much.


With an estimated 200,000 Arkansans eligible for expanded Medicaid through the
private health plans, the centers fear a big financial hit.
Medicaid reimburses health centers better than private doctors because federal
law requires the centers be paid in relation to the actual cost of care they
provide. The higher rates are supposed to reflect the sicker and poorer patients
they see and the fact they can't limit the number of uninsured or Medicaid
patients they treat.
As more states look to follow Arkansas' lead --- Utah and New Hampshire are
among those considering similar expansion plans --- health centers are bracing
for the worst.
"Medicaid is our single largest payer and if that payment rate is destabilized,
then, we will start to see health centers close due to financial viability and
solvency issues," said Daniel Hawkins, senior vice president of the National
Association of Community Health Centers, which traditionally treat many patients
who are uninsured or on Medicaid.
The Pennsylvania Association of Community Health Centers lodged a protest in
January against a draft proposal by Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican seeking
federal approval of a similar private option plan that would force centers to
negotiate their rates with private plans.  But the state reversed course in the
final application submitted Wednesday to the Obama administration, guaranteeing
that centers could keep their current rates and that health plans include them
in their networks.

Iowa, the only other state currently using the private option, albeit on a
smaller scale, also pays health centers at their full rate.
Medicaid is a state-federal program that covers the poor.  The health law
expands coverage in participating states to everyone under 138 percent of
federal poverty level, or up to $15,600 for an individual, with the federal
government paying the full cost through 2016 and states covering up to 10
percent of the cost in subsequent years.
State Perspective
When the federal government approved Arkansas' plan last year, it asked the
state and Arkansas' 12 health centers to negotiate a new payment system.  No
deal has been reached though, so insurance plans have paid the centers the same
discounted rates they negotiate with private physicians.
Arkansas Medicaid Director Andy Allison argues that Medicaid funding for health
centers should be cut for the same reason the law cut federal funding to
hospitals -they are expected to see fewer uninsured patients and therefore have
less uncompensated care.
"We don't agree with that," said Alvin Sliger, Mid-Delta's soft spoken executive
director. He and other health center officials say they deserve higher
reimbursements than private physicians because they will continue to treat
sicker and poorer patients and under federal law, must offer broader services,
including dental care, immunizations and mental health treatments.  Unlike
private physicians, moreover, the centers cannot limit the number of Medicaid or
uninsured patients they treat.  Those rules don't change under the private
option Medicaid.
Sliger also says its uncertain how quickly the uninsured will enroll in Medicaid
-and, therefore, how many uninsured his clinic will still see.
Since the Medicaid expansion began in January, Mid-Delta has received $60 for
routine office visits for Medicaid private option enrollees who are covered by
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arkansas, compared to the $138 it gets from
traditional Medicaid.
About 30 percent of Mid-Delta's patients, for instance, have high blood pressure
and 14 percent have diabetes-both higher than national averages. Slightly more
than half are uninsured, 17 percent receive Medicaid and 90 percent have incomes
below 200 percent of federal poverty level, or $23,000 for an individual -
roughly the median income in the region.
The centers treated about 156,000 patients in 2011, the latest year for which
figures are available, including 67,000 who were uninsured.

Massachusetts Example
Hawkins, of the national trade group, noted that in Massachusetts, more than one
in five of the patients seen at health centers in 2011 were still uninsured,
down from 36 percent in 2007 when the state went to near universal coverage.
Despite the drop in that state's uninsured rate, the actual number of uninsured
residents receiving care at Massachusetts health centers increased by 6 percent
between 2007 and 2011,  as private physicians focused on those who had coverage,
according to a study by George Washington University.
While health centers may lose some patients who see private physicians after
they gain coverage, the Massachusetts experience suggests that many will
continue to use the centers for primary care because they are nearby and offer
needed services.
Health centers got a bonanza from the health law to help them gear up to treat
newly insured people as well as those who still lacked coverage --- $11 billion
in additional federal funding over five years to expand and modernize. The
nation's 1,200 community health centers have thousands of sites and treat 21
million people a year, most of them poor.
Allison said he didn't expect the pushback he has received. "I'm a little
surprised at how they are reacting," he said in an interview in Little Rock.
The Obama administration would likely have to approve a cut in centers' Medicaid
funding because the way they are paid is set through federal law, said Sip
Mouden, executive director of Community Health Centers of Arkansas.
Meanwhile, the GOP-led Arkansas Legislature began meeting this month and it's
uncertain whether it will renew its private-option Medicaid expansion plan
beyond June 30.
Despite all the uncertainty, Mid-Delta has continued enrolling its clients in
Obamacare - with most joining Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the only private
option plan available in the county.
"I am rejoiced and happy," said Rosalita Lott, 60, who enrolled at the center
last month. "It's a lot of pressure off of me and I will be able to sleep
tonight." © 2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.

Diagnostic Ultrasound forms customer care unit  Diagnostic Ultrasound (Bothell,
Washington), which makes ultrasound devices, reported the creation of a new
customer care subsidiary. The Diagnostic Ultrasound Customer Care Corp. was
created to improve the company's business processes and customer service.

"The mission of this new corporation is to take excellent care of our customers
and offer seamless communication and a very high level of competence," said
Gerald McMorrow, founder, chief executive officer and chairman of the board.

The new subsidiary integrates all Diagnostic Ultrasound personnel who regularly
interact with customers, including the U.S. sales force, inside sales, order
processing, trade show coordination and customer service. Through ongoing
training and better coordination of processes between these departments, the
company said the new customer care team will provide the most efficient and
comprehensive service to its customers.

"Customers should experience a reduction in hold times and call transfers - the
goal is that 'one call does it all,'" said Minda Evans, director of customer
care.

UT dental college dedicates new center  The University of Tennessee College of
Dentistry (Memphis, Tennessee) dedicated its dental simulation center in
recognition of a $1 million gift from Delta Dental Plan of Tennessee (Nashville,
Tennessee).

Made possible by state funding in 2001, the center is the only one of its kind
in the world and includes a renovated laboratory with 40 interactive, virtual
reality simulators in one room and 80 conventional simulators in the other. The
Delta Dental Plan gift will go toward maintenance and upgrading of the
laboratories, which will be named the Dental Delta Plan of Tennessee Dental
Simulation Center.

Russell Gilpatrick, DDS, dean of the UT College of Dentistry, said, "We are very
grateful to Delta Dental Plan of Tennessee for their generous support. In 1998,
they established one of our largest scholarship endowments. This additional
gift, which is the largest single donation ever received by the College of
Dentistry, will help us properly maintain and upgrade the simulation
laboratories in years to come. This gift will also go a long way toward ensuring
a technologically advanced education for the next generation of dental
students."

HFMA releases study results  A research series led by the Healthcare Financial
Management Association (HFMA; Westchester, Illinois) in partnership with GE
Healthcare Financial Services (Chicago, Illinois) found that nearly
three-fourths of chief financial officers said they would increase their
hospitals' capital spending over the next five years.

CFOs expect to increase capital spending by an average of 14% per year, with
spending in certain regions of the U.S. rising more than others. In contrast,
average annual increases in capital spending between 1997 and 2001 were merely
1%. Driving this increased spending are three primary, often competing issues
CFOs face in operating their companies: staying ahead of deteriorating fixed
assets (plant, property and medical equipment), a need to upgrade technology and
increasing capacity.

States expected to need the most significant percentage increases in capital
spending by hospitals are Idaho, Georgia, Florida, California, Tennessee,
Alaska, Texas Rhode Island, Arkansas and Arizona.

States expected to experience comparatively lower acute capital needs are
Louisiana, Ohio, Iowa, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Hawaii and South
Dakota.

HFMA and PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the research for this study. The
findings were based on a survey of CFOs at 460 hospitals and health systems
nationwide, and are contained in the third report of Financing the Future.

Obituary: Former Delta dean Hill made a difference

BYLINE: Almendra Carpizo, The Record, Stockton, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 740 words


Nov. 17--STOCKTON -- To know Hazel Hill was to love her, Hill's close friends
and colleagues said.

The educator, philanthropist and advocate was devoted to her work and students
at San Joaquin Delta College, and was an energetic and loving person.

"She was a fireball. A doer," Dean McNeilly said of Hill. "A fun person who
enjoyed her work and was dedicated to her students ... I can't say enough good
things about her."

Hill died Friday, a week after suffering a stroke, McNeilly said. She was 65.

McNeilly, who met Hill in the early 1980s when she began teaching at Delta, said
Hill was loved and respected in the community. She was always cheerful and
incredibly hardworking, he added.

"She just made a tremendous difference," said McNeilly, a retired Delta College
dean for vocational education.

Hill, who earned a doctorate in education in vocational technical education,
retired from the college in 2011 after more than 35 years.

"Hazel retired as Dean of (Career Technical Education and Workforce
Development), and for many years she WAS the face of the College in the
community," Delta Superintendent and President Kathy Hart wrote in a statement
to the campus. The two women met in August 1994, when Hart joined Delta College.

Hart told The Record that Hill taught her the value of career technical
education and how important it is for students who are more interested in
applied programs than humanities, social sciences or science.

She was extremely committed to her job and worked tirelessly, Hart said. She
arrived to work early, left late and would work on the weekends.

Hill is credited with the creation of Delta College's Child Development Center
and creating classes for people who wanted to be certified to become foster
parents, as well as securing a grant to bolster Delta's psychiatric technician
program to produce staff for California Health Care Facility, a prison facility
on the outskirts of the city.

"To list all of Hazel's accomplishments and all the people that she quietly
helped would be impossible," Hart wrote.

That's also how City Hall spokeswoman Connie Cochran remembers Hill, whom she
met in the early 2000s.

"Hazel was a mentor and a friend, and she was the most selfless person whom I've
ever known," Cochran said.

Hill was always concerned for everyone else and when people had a problem or
need, she would always say, "Well, let's make that happen," Cochran recalled.

Losing Hill will leave a void in the community, she said. Many people probably
didn't realize the true impact of her actions. Hill was not only a great
resource for Stockton, but was respected and known throughout California.

McNeilly said Hill was involved in California Community College Association of
Occupational Education, worked in numerous committees and helped create the
Caterpillar Dealer Service Technician Program at Delta, which recruits women
into a nontraditional field as highly paid service technicians.

In 2006, Hill earned an Athena Award, an honor that recognizes local women for
their professional accomplishments, community service and role in helping other
women succeed. The same year, she was recognized as the 2006 Economic
Development Person of the Year by the California Community Colleges.

"I enjoy most being a positive role model for folks, showing them they can do it
and providing encouragement," Hill said in 2006.

"She was a terrible speller," McNeilly said with a laugh, "but just did a great
job working with students and faculty."

Hill, who along with her husband also helped shelter dogs, was the Rotary Club
of Stockton president-elect and was to take over on July 1, club secretary Susan
Drake said.

She was enthusiastic about being president and was taking it seriously, Drake
said.

Hill was attending training and had great ideas of things she wanted to
implement.

"I ran this office for 11 presidents and she was going to be one of the great
ones," Drake said. "She was an amazing woman. I so admired her."

In a Facebook post, Hill's husband, Jim Hill, wrote, "Hazel, my wife, passed
away Friday, Nov 13th. I loved her with all my heart, and always will. Services
are private, but a public celebration of her life will be held at a future
date."

Charity supports health for all citizens

BYLINE: VANSUN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 281 words


A Chinese-Canadian community charity has donated more than $ 180,000 to
health-care facilities in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley.

The Community Care Foundation grants include $ 32,000 for a fetal monitor and
incubator at Mission Memorial Hospital.

The money is for the purchase of new hospital and rehabilitation equipment, new
health-care initiative and translation of materials and education programs.

"We felt it was important as a community that we give something out to benefit
all Canadians in the Lower Mainland," said Kenneth Kwan, president of the
foundation.

The charity works within the Chinese-Canadian community to provide funds for
medical and health-care institutions.

"What we tried to do was motivate the Chinese community as a team to work
together to benefit the whole society," said Kwan.

"We're not just concerned with the well-being and health of Chinese people, we
want to improve services for anyone who needs help that isn't being provided for
right now."

The foundation had to pare down 26 requests for a total of $ 1.25 million in
grant money, said Dr. Peter Wong, who chaired an allocation committee.

"We try to do this as fairly and as equitably as we can," Wong said. "We try to
look at the most pressing needs in our decision."

Next year, the foundation hopes to double its grants by raising $ 365,000.

Recipients this year include B.C. Women's Hospital, Delta Hospital, St. Paul's
Hospital, the B.C. Multi-ethnic Marrow Transplant Society, the Strathcona
Chinese Stroke Club, Langley Memorial Hospital, and the University of B.C. for
several separate projects to be carried out at Women's and Children's hospitals.

Doggie Howser: Canines join YRMC therapy

BYLINE: Chris McDaniel, The Sun, Yuma, Ariz.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 568 words


June 03--For those stuck in a hospital bed and suffering from illness or trauma,
a visit from a friendly dog may be just what the doctor ordered.

This prescription will soon be filled for patients at Yuma Regional Medical
Center thanks to an $18,000 grant provided by the Yuma Rotary Club. The grant
provides funding for the new Tails of Joy Pet Partners Visitation Program, which
will bring therapeutic dogs to patients' bedsides by the end of summer.

"We couldn't have done it without Yuma Rotary's generous financial assistance,"
said Elizabeth Hammonds, YRMC volunteer services officer and Tails of Joy
program coordinator.

"This program is a winning thing for the hospital and for our Rotary club,"
added Chuck Nordquist, who is also assistant district Rotary governor.

"We had the money on hand to get this thing going and we decided unilaterally
that we would do this program. These animals can bring relief to people who are
suffering in the hospital, who are ill and really need to have some positive
things going their way."

Making patients more comfortable is why YRMC has embraced the new program,
Hammonds said.

"This program provides patients the opportunity to interact safely with the dogs
and receive their unconditional love and acceptance in the hopes of making the
hospital environment more comfortable."

But before being allowed in the hospital, all dogs and their volunteer handlers
must go through an application process, background check, health screening and
interview.

That process is being handled by Delta Society Pet Partners, a nationally
recognized program for therapy dogs.

To be in the program, dogs must accept a friendly stranger, accept petting no
matter how strenuous, be properly groomed, be able to walk unperturbed through a
crowd of strangers, not be disturbed by random sights or loud noises, be
obedient to commands, not lunge for objects and be neutral around other animals.

Once the handlers and their dogs have met all the Pet Partners requirements and
complete the YRMC volunteer process, they will undergo orientation at YRMC.

About 13 handlers who want to participate in the new program gathered with their
dogs Saturday at Yuma Regional Corporate Center to be evaluated by Cindy Lipton,
a trainer with Delta Society Pet Partners.

"I think it is really exciting," Lipton said in between evaluations.

Delores Gauna brought Bo, her 6-year-old boxer, to be evaluated by Lipton. Guana
has already been taking Bo to Yuma area assisted living facilities, nursing
homes, and schools.

"To just see the interaction between Bo and residents was phenomenal, so it just
kind of went from there."

The part she enjoys most is watching the patients' faces light up when Bo comes
to visit.

"That is the purpose of these dogs -- to make someone smile. If these dogs can
make someone smile, they have done their job."

Many patients enjoy petting Bo, "and of course he likes all the attention,"
Gauna said. "It is really rewarding if you like working with your animal. It is
an ideal situation all around for clients as well as the handler."

Gauna passed the evaluation with flying colors and will be part of the first
animal therapy teams to visit patients at YRMC when the program kicks off.

"We are very excited and very privileged to be part of this beginning group,"
she said.

Members of the Oklahoma State Medical Association are urging Congress to
maintain Medicare physician rates.

Currently, the program's payment system is based on national gross domestic
product. However, even as gross domestic product declines, health care costs are
rising, so a cut in physician fees could wreak havoc in the health care system,
according to the OSMA.

The association notes that a 12 percent cut in Medicare reimbursement fees for
doctors is planned over the next three years, which will cost Oklahoma
physicians an estimated $127 million -- an average loss of $21,949 per doctor.

An American Medical Association study found that one in four Oklahoma physicians
have already placed limits on the number of Medicare patients they treat or plan
to institute limits in the next six months due to low reimbursement.

About 15 percent of Oklahomans are on Medicare, which is slightly higher than
the national average of 14 percent. But Oklahoma has only 10.9 doctors per 1,000
Medicare patients, well below the national average of 15.7. That
doctor-to-Medicare-patient ratio is one of the 10 lowest in the nation.

Reviewing grants

Michael Gilmore, vice president of research at the University of Oklahoma Health
Sciences Center, has been selected to serve on the Oral Biology and Medicine
Study Section, which reviews grant applications submitted to the National
Institutes of Health. Gilmore's term begins immediately and ends on June 30,
2004.

Delta Dental

The Delta Dental Plan of Oklahoma Distance Learning Center has opened in the
University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center complex in Oklahoma City.

In May, a $50,000 contribution from the Delta Dental Plan of Oklahoma Charitable
Foundation formed the base of an $85,000 total capital investment for Phase 1,
building a 725-square-foot teaching lab.

The first of four proposed distance-learning sites opened in April at the
Tri-County Technology Center in Bartlesville. The Delta Dental Distance Learning
lab is providing instruction to eight students at the Bartlesville center with
that number expected to double in 2003. The next goal of the program is to
develop distance-learning resources in three additional geographic quadrants of
the state over the next four years. One additional rural site will be added in
the 2003-04 academic year. Two additional sites are planned in the 2004-05
academic year.

In the state of Oklahoma, about 50 dental hygienists currently graduate from the
three dental hygiene programs in the state -- only 71 percent of what Oklahoma
Employment Security Commission data shows are needed annually. In addition, most
graduates are concentrating in the larger metropolitan areas, leaving rural
communities experiencing serious difficulty employing qualified dental
hygienists.

With the new distance-learning program, students will now have the advantage of
remaining close to home to complete their bachelor's degree. Additionally, since
the program will not require a move to an urban environment, it is more likely
that the graduates of the program will remain in their native rural area.

OU College of Medicine

Dewayne Andrews, a University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center teacher and
physician, has been named dean of the OU College of Medicine and vice president
of Health Affairs.

The OU Board of Regents approved the appointment of Andrews, who had served as
interim executive dean of the College of Medicine since June.

As dean of the College of Medicine, Andrews also has been named the Lawrence N.
Upjohn Chair in Medicine. Andrews has served as senior associate dean for
academic affairs in the College of Medicine since 1996.

OU Medical Center

Physicians at OU Medical Center have become the first doctors in Oklahoma City
to use MammoSite Radiation Therapy System in the battle against breast cancer.

MammoSite RTS, a new outpatient procedure recently approved by Federal Drug
Administration for the treatment of breast cancer, is designed to offer the
benefits of breast brachytherapy without the discomfort and inconvenience.

"The great thing about this treatment is that it no longer requires whole breast
radiation, but treatment can be completed in about a week -- not six-to-seven
weeks like traditional treatment options," said Nina Mayr, new director of
Radiation Oncology at OU Medical Center.

MammoSite is a single catheter with a balloon-tipped end that is inserted into
the cavity created by the lumpectomy, the removal of the cancerous tumor from
the breast. The procedure irradiates the area surrounding the cavity created by
the lumpectomy, where tumors are most likely to recur, and may avoid some of the
side effects of external beam therapy.

Medical records

Laura L. Cross, a member of the law firm of Scoggins & Cross, will give a
presentation on Oct. 9 at the Lorman Education Services seminar on
Confidentiality of Medical Records in Oklahoma. Cross will speak on computerized
medical research, professional and ethical issues in disclosure of medical
records, risk management strategies, and confidentiality of mental health
records. The seminar will be at the Renaissance Hotel in Oklahoma City.

HIV/AIDS conference

The 13th annual Oklahoma HIV/AIDS Conference will be Thursday and Friday at the
Clarion Meridian Hotel and Convention Center, 737 S. Meridian Ave.

The conference, co-sponsored by the Oklahoma State Department of Health,
numerous AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, and
pharmaceutical companies, will focus on helping people deal with the challenges
of living with HIV/AIDS.

The keynote speaker will be Philip Keiser, medical director of AETC-Parkland
Hospital in Dallas.

State Health Commissioner Leslie Beitsch will be moderator of a panel on current
research activities. Guest panelists include Walt Senterfitt, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention; Mike Jackson, clinical director at the Oklahoma
Department of Corrections; Tom Coburn, co-chairman of the Presidential Advisory
Council on HIV/AIDS and former Oklahoma congressman; and Ronald Greenfield,
chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center.

To register for the conference, call 271-4636.

OU Physicians

Two OU Physicians plastic surgery specialists are now seeing patients at the
group's Edmond clinic.

Jayesh Panchal, of Edmond, is providing general cosmetic and reconstructive
surgery services, including breast reconstruction surgery, facial surgery,
pediatric plastic surgery and treatment of skin cancer. He is co-director of the
group's Cleft and Craniofacial Team.

Ivan Wayne is a facial plastic surgeon. Wayne, who recently joined OU
Physicians, comes to Oklahoma from the University of Miami School of Medicine,
where he completed a fellowship in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Joseph F. Montebello has joined the radiology staff of OU Physicians. He
specializes in radiation oncology and is board-certified in therapeutic
radiology.

Montebello holds patents for two types of radiation therapy equipment. He comes
to OU Physicians from the Indiana University School of Medicine, where he was a
professor in the radiation oncology department.

Midwest Occupational Medicine

J. Kevin Lee has accepted the position of medical director for Midwest
Occupational Medicine. Lee was chief resident in physical medicine and
rehabilitation at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center and medical
director of the Integris Bass Occupational Medicine Clinic in Enid. He has also
served as a staff physician at Oklahoma Orthopaedics Lighthouse Fitness Center.

Foundation for Medical Quality

Dale Bratzler received the Award for Excellence in Physician Leadership at the
National Healthcare Quality Improvement Awards Dinner sponsored by the James Q.
Cannon Memorial Endowment in Hunt Valley, Md.

Bratzler is the director of the Health Care Quality Improvement Program at the
Oklahoma Foundation for Medical Quality. He is also the principal clinical
coordinator for the Infectious Diseases Quality Improvement Organization Support
Center and an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Health
Administration and Policy at the College of Public Health in the University of
Oklahoma's Health Sciences Center.

Midwest City Therapy

Janet Kampling-Jones has been named director of physical therapy for Midwest
City Therapy.

Integris Baptist Medical Center

Integris Baptist Medical Center has been honored with the National Research
Corp.'s 2002 Consumer Choice Award. This is the seventh year Integris Baptist
Medical Center has received that recognition.

Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Network

Integris Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Network has been awarded a $913,452 grant
from the U.S. Department of Education to help migrant and seasonal farmworkers
with severe disabilities get jobs when they can no longer work in the fields. A
total of 8,111 migrant and seasonal farmworkers and nearly 6,000 household
members live in Oklahoma, according to the Health Resources and Services
Administration. An estimated 2,000 have a severe disability.

Washington: FACT SHEET: Increasing Investment in Rural America

LENGTH: 2857  words

DATELINE: Washington


The White House has issued the following news release:

This week, the White House Rural Council will host the inaugural Rural
Opportunity Investment Conference (ROI) to promote potential investment
opportunities that exist throughout rural America. Top leaders from the business
community and financial institutions, senior government officials, rural
economic development experts and others from across the country, will come
together to discuss ways to develop partnerships that create jobs, grow small
businesses, and invest in critical rural infrastructure.

In conjunction with this event, the White House Rural Council is announcing a
$10 billion dollar investment fund to promote rural economic development. This
fund will continue to grow the rural economy by increasing access to capital for
rural infrastructure projects and speeding up the process of rural
infrastructure improvements. The fund is immediately open for business and more
investors can now add to the initial $10 billion in available capital.

The ROI conference and the new investment fund are part of the Obama
Administration's ongoing efforts to promote investment in rural America,
strengthen the nation's infrastructure, and grow the U.S. economy. Since the
creation of the White House Rural Council in 2011, the President has made
historic investments in rural America designed to drive job growth, invest in
rural education, provide emergency services, and address health disparities.

Public-Partnerships at Work

Rural Infrastructure Opportunity Fund. The U.S. Rural Infrastructure Opportunity
Fund represents a new approach to catalyzing private investment in
infrastructure projects in rural America. CoBank, a national cooperative bank
serving rural America and a member of the Farm Credit System, is the fund's
anchor investor, committing $10 billion to get the fund off the ground. Capitol
Peak Asset Management will manage the new fund and work to recruit more
investors to add to CoBank's initial commitment. The Rural Infrastructure
Opportunity Fund will allow America's rural economy to continue its forward
momentum by enhancing access to capital for rural infrastructure projects and
speeding up the process of rural infrastructure improvements. The fund is
immediately open for business and more investors can now add to the initial $10
billion in available capital. The new fund will allow a wide variety of new
participants, including pension funds, endowments, foundations, and other
institutional investors that have not traditionally had access to these markets
to invest in rural development. In some cases, projects may be funded entirely
through private sector dollars. In others, private dollars may be leveraged with
and extend critical government loan and grant programs. USDA and other agencies
will help to identify rural projects in need of financing through the new fund
and through other such private sources and public-private partnerships. Target
investments will include rural community facilities (especially health care and
educational facilities), rural water and wastewater systems, rural energy
projects, rural broadband expansion efforts, local and regional food systems,
and other rural infrastructure.
 Over $150 Million Investment Funds to Grow Small Businesses, Create Jobs in
Rural America. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the creation of an
investment fund earlier this year that will help propel the growth of small
businesses across rural America. The new rural equity fund will facilitate
private equity investments in agriculture-related businesses. Advantage Capital
Agribusiness Partners, which will manage the new fund, and nine Farm Credit
institution partners, have pledged to invest over $150 million into the new
effort. USDA programs have historically provided loans or loan guarantees to
help rural businesses grow, but before the creation of the Rural Business
Investment Program, many small cutting-edge businesses did not have the
opportunity to obtain equity support. With the creation and implementation of
this new program, USDA is pleased to announce this first of multiple rural
equity funds. USDA is currently accepting applications for additional new rural
equity funds.
 $9.9 Million to Improve Health Care Quality and Address Rural Health
Disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services continues its efforts
as part of the President's Improving Rural Health Care Initiative with $5.5
million to the Delta State Rural Development Network Grant program and $4.3
million for the Small Health Care Provider Quality Improvement grant program.
The Delta Network program invests in each of the eight States of the Delta
region to address long-standing health care disparities. The Small Health Care
Provider Quality program supports 29 grants that help rural health clinics,
community health centers and small rural hospitals improve health care outcomes
for rural residents with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and
obesity.
 Supporting Small, Rural Businesses. Small businesses create about two out of
every three jobs in the U.S. each year, and roughly half of working Americans
either own or work for a small business. Small businesses are particularly
crucial to the rural economy.
 Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative. The American Farm Bureau Federation and
Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business Global Social Enterprise
Initiative are collaborating on a multi-year partnership providing tools and
solutions to help strengthen rural America. In the partnership's inaugural year,
the focus will be on building greater economic security by launching a Rural
Entrepreneurship Initiative together with Startup Hoyas, Georgetown's
Entrepreneurship Initiative. Several opportunities will be announced for people
interested in rural issues across the U.S. to actively engage with Farm Bureau
and the Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative, including an online educational
series, the first of its kind rural entrepreneurship challenge and a national
summit scheduled for October 14th at Georgetown University. The White House
Rural Council will partner with Farm Bureau and Global Social Enterprise
Initiative to plan the national summit at Georgetown University.
 Made in Rural America. Earlier this year, the President directed the White
House Rural Council to bring together federal resources to help rural businesses
and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new
customers and markets abroad. Department of Commerce Secretary Pritzker,
Department of Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, Small Business Administration
Administrator Contreras-Sweet, US Trade Representative Froman, and Export-Import
Bank Chairman Hochberg are leading forums in rural America this summer to
highlight opportunities for rural manufactures, value added producers, and
service providers to grow their businesses by expanding to international
markets. The partnership will also host a "Made in Native America" forum this
fall to help Native-owned businesses access export opportunities.
 Expanding Partnerships. The Administration recognizes that effective
partnerships have a catalytic impact on achieving the Administration priorities,
such as increasing opportunity and economic growth in rural America. Good ideas
generated by the ROI Conference will be carried forward by the following
partnership networks.
 Regional Conservation Partnership Program. The newly stood up Regional
Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) takes an innovative approach to
furthering conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of soil, water, and
wildlife on a regional scale. The program enables partners, using a competitive
process, to propose conservation projects that will leverage federal dollars
with non-profit, producer, and non-traditional investors in areas of the country
with critical conservation needs. The RCPP will invest more than $1.2 billion in
natural resource conservation with a goal of doubling that effort through
partnership contributions over the next five years.
 Georgetown University Law Center's Public Private Partnership Symposium. In
conjunction with the White House Rural Council's Rural Opportunity Investment
Conference, the Georgetown University Law Center will introduce its inaugural
Public Private Partnership Symposium. Over the coming year, the Georgetown Law
will host three full-day sessions to advance the ideas and lessons discussed at
the Rural Opportunity Investment Conference. By bringing together private sector
leaders, government officials, and academic scholars, the symposium will broaden
opportunities for partnering, provide a venue for sharing knowledge and best
practices, and promote economic growth.
 The Build America Investment Initiative. The Administration is committed to
increasing public private partnerships and collaboration on U.S. infrastructure.
Just last week, the President announced the new Build America Investment
Initiative, which will use executive authorities to increase the flow of private
capital into transportation, water, energy and other infrastructure sectors. The
ROI conference will directly inform the ongoing work of the Build America
Initiative, helping federal agencies to encourage more investment into rural
communities and to key rural infrastructure sectors.
 The Rural Health Philanthropy Partnership. This partnership between the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Rural Health Policy,
Grantmakers in Health and the National Rural Health Association includes more
than 30 State and regional Foundations and Trusts that seek to improve health
care in rural communities. In 2015, the Partnership is undertaking a Rural
Funding Challenge with HHS dedicating $5 million and seeking a matched effort
from the philanthropic community.

White House Rural Council's Sustained Support for the Rural Economy

Today's announcements build on three years of sustained work by the White House
Rural Council to expand opportunity in all corners of rural America. The Rural
Council has over twenty policy accomplishments supporting rural America in four
priority areas: quality of life, innovation, economic opportunity, and
conservation. These advancements will help ensure the development of a rural
economy built to last. These actions include:

Increasing Capital Access for Rural Small Businesses

USDA and SBA committed to providing $175 million in microloans to small
businesses in rural areas for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014, in addition to new
business training and counseling opportunities. To date the two agencies have
supported over $85 million to rural small businesses.

Accelerating Broadband Infrastructure Deployment

On June 14, 2012 President Obama signed an Executive Order to make broadband
construction along Federal roadways and properties up to 90 percent cheaper and
more efficient. U.S agencies that manage Federal properties and roads are
partnering to offer carriers a single approach to leasing Federal assets for
broadband deployment. Providing a uniform approach for broadband carriers to
build networks is speeding the delivery of connectivity to communities,
business, and schools in rural America. In order to further expand the nation's
broadband service, more than 25 cities and 60 national research universities are
partnering to form "US Ignite." US Ignite is creating a new wave of services
that will extend programmable broadband networks to 100 times the speed of
today's internet. To further leverage private-sector involvement, a three-day
Application Summit was conducted this June at the headquarters of Juniper
Networks in Silicon Valley. This session made numerous connections that will
strengthen rural and urban communities through innovative broadband
applications. In total, this partnership will improve services to Americans and
drive job creation, promote innovation, and create new markets for American
business.

U.S Department of Education Investing in Rural Schools

Through the national broadband plan, the Obama Administration is leveraging the
power of technology to overcome distance and increase collaboration to
accelerate student achievement in rural schools. The White House Rural Council
partnered with the U.S Department of Education to deliver a new online community
of practice groups for rural schools. This online tool is creating virtual
communities of practice for educators to connect to resources, tools,
colleagues, experts, and learned activities both within and beyond schools. As
part of the push for broadband in public schools, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) is investing $2 billion over the next two years to dramatically
expand high-speed Internet connectivity for America's schools and libraries --
connecting 20 million more students to next-generation broadband and wireless.
Private-sector companies have also committed more than $2 billion to deliver
cutting-edge technologies to classrooms. The Administration is using technology
to break down geographic barriers and address rural isolation in education.

Local Food, Local Places

Recognizing the role local food systems can play in regional economic
development, the Administration launched Local Food, Local Places in June, 2014.
This effort, a partnership between the US Department of Agriculture, the US
Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional Commission, provides
direct technical assistance to twenty communities integrating local food
production into their civic planning process.

Small Business Administration Investing in Rural Small Businesses

The Administration extended more than $400 million in FY 2011 of investments in
rural America through the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Impact
Investment Program, at no cost to taxpayers. Nearly $2 billion in additional
funding will be invested by the end of fiscal year 2016. These investments will
continue to help finance, grow, expand, and modernize rural small business
operations around the country.

Promoting a Bioeconomy through BioPreferred

To support the Administration's "Blueprint for a Bioeconomy," the President is
utilizing the purchasing power of the Federal government by directing Federal
agencies to take additional steps to significantly increase the purchase of
biobased products over the next two years, which will create thousands of new
rural jobs and drive innovation where biobased products are grown and
manufactured. Utilizing the existing BioPreferred program, the Federal
government will use its procurement power to increase the purchasing and use of
biobased products, promoting rural economic development, creating new jobs, and
providing new markets for farm commodities. Biobased products include items like
paints, soaps and detergents and are developed from plants, rather than
chemicals or petroleum bases. The biobased products sector marries the two most
important economic engines for rural America: agriculture and manufacturing.

Rural Jobs Accelerator

The "Rural Jobs Accelerator" links Federal programs to facilitate job creation
and economic development in rural communities by utilizing regional development
strategies. The "Rural Jobs Accelerator" allows multiple agencies to coordinate
technical assistance and grant/loan programs so that a consortium of public and
private rural entities can have a single access point within the Federal
government, creating improved access, streamlining of programs, and better
leveraging of resources. USDA, EDA, Delta Regional Authority, and Appalachian
Regional Commission have leveraged approximately $9 million in funding, with
additional technical support from various Federal agencies including Department
of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Education.

Commercial Aviation Biofuels Partnership

The Navy, the Department of Energy, and USDA have joined forces to spur the
creation of an advanced biofuels industry that will support commercial aviation,
with a pledge of $510 million, over three years, under the Defense Production
Act of 1950.

Unprecedented Investments in Rural America

Historic Investment in Rural America

U.S. Department of Agriculture

The White House Rural Council is chaired by Secretary Vilsack, who in his role
as Secretary of the Department of Agriculture has made unprecedented
state-by-state investments in rural America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
works with thousands of farmers, ranchers and others living in rural communities
every day and knows that there is no limit to the economic potential of rural
America. Over the past five years, USDA has made significant investments to
support those in rural America who drive the rural economy forward, carry out
record conservation efforts, facilitate groundbreaking research, promote new
markets for rural products, and provide a safe, affordable and nutritious food
supply for American families. Secretary Vilsack invites the private sector to
continue building innovative partnerships that drive investments, economic
growth, and prosperity.

anchor investor, committing $10 billion to get the fund off the ground. Capitol
Peak Asset Management will manage the new fund and work to recruit more
investors to add to CoBank's initial commitment. The Rural Infrastructure
Opportunity Fund will allow America's rural economy to continue its forward
momentum by enhancing access to capital for rural infrastructure projects and
speeding up the process of rural infrastructure improvements. The fund is
immediately open for business and more investors can now add to the initial $10
billion in available capital. The new fund will allow a wide variety of new
participants, including pension funds, endowments, foundations, and other
institutional investors that have not traditionally had access to these markets
to invest in rural development. In some cases, projects may be funded entirely
through private sector dollars. In others, private dollars may be leveraged with
and extend critical government loan and grant programs. USDA and other agencies
will help to identify rural projects in need of financing through the new fund
and through other such private sources and public-private partnerships. Target
investments will include rural community facilities (especially health care and
educational facilities), rural water and wastewater systems, rural energy
projects, rural broadband expansion efforts, local and regional food systems,
and other rural infrastructure.
 Over $150 Million Investment Funds to Grow Small Businesses, Create Jobs in
Rural America. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the creation of an
investment fund earlier this year that will help propel the growth of small
businesses across rural America. The new rural equity fund will facilitate
private equity investments in agriculture-related businesses. Advantage Capital
Agribusiness Partners, which will manage the new fund, and nine Farm Credit
institution partners, have pledged to invest over $150 million into the new
effort. USDA programs have historically provided loans or loan guarantees to
help rural businesses grow, but before the creation of the Rural Business
Investment Program, many small cutting-edge businesses did not have the
opportunity to obtain equity support. With the creation and implementation of
this new program, USDA is pleased to announce this first of multiple rural
equity funds. USDA is currently accepting applications for additional new rural
equity funds.
 $9.9 Million to Improve Health Care Quality and Address Rural Health
Disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services continues its efforts
as part of the President's Improving Rural Health Care Initiative with $5.5
million to the Delta State Rural Development Network Grant program and $4.3
million for the Small Health Care Provider Quality Improvement grant program.
The Delta Network program invests in each of the eight States of the Delta
region to address long-standing health care disparities. The Small Health Care
Provider Quality program supports 29 grants that help rural health clinics,
community health centers and small rural hospitals improve health care outcomes
for rural residents with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and
obesity.
 Supporting Small, Rural Businesses. Small businesses create about two out of
every three jobs in the U.S. each year, and roughly half of working Americans
either own or work for a small business. Small businesses are particularly
crucial to the rural economy.
 Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative. The American Farm Bureau Federation and
Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business Global Social Enterprise
Initiative are collaborating on a multi-year partnership providing tools and
solutions to help strengthen rural America. In the partnership's inaugural year,
the focus will be on building greater economic security by launching a Rural
Entrepreneurship Initiative together with Startup Hoyas, Georgetown's
Entrepreneurship Initiative. Several opportunities will be announced for people
interested in rural issues across the U.S. to actively engage with Farm Bureau
and the Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative, including an online educational
series, the first of its kind rural entrepreneurship challenge and a national
summit scheduled for October 14th at Georgetown University. The White House
Rural Council will partner with Farm Bureau and Global Social Enterprise
Initiative to plan the national summit at Georgetown University.
 Made in Rural America. Earlier this year, the President directed the White
House Rural Council to bring together federal resources to help rural businesses
and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new
customers and markets abroad. Department of Commerce Secretary Pritzker,
Department of Agriculture Secretary Vilsack, Small Business Administration
Administrator Contreras-Sweet, US Trade Representative Froman, and Export-Import
Bank Chairman Hochberg are leading forums in rural America this summer to
highlight opportunities for rural manufactures, value added producers, and
service providers to grow their businesses by expanding to international
markets. The partnership will also host a "Made in Native America" forum this
fall to help Native-owned businesses access export opportunities.
 Expanding Partnerships. The Administration recognizes that effective
partnerships have a catalytic impact on achieving the Administration priorities,
such as increasing opportunity and economic growth in rural America. Good ideas
generated by the ROI Conference will be carried forward by the following
partnership networks.
 Regional Conservation Partnership Program. The newly stood up Regional
Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) takes an innovative approach to
furthering conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of soil, water, and
wildlife on a regional scale. The program enables partners, using a competitive
process, to propose conservation projects that will leverage federal dollars
with non-profit, producer, and non-traditional investors in areas of the country
with critical conservation needs. The RCPP will invest more than $1.2 billion in
natural resource conservation with a goal of doubling that effort through
partnership contributions over the next five years.
 Georgetown University Law Center's Public Private Partnership Symposium. In
conjunction with the White House Rural Council's Rural Opportunity Investment
Conference, the Georgetown University Law Center will introduce its inaugural
Public Private Partnership Symposium. Over the coming year, the Georgetown Law
will host three full-day sessions to advance the ideas and lessons discussed at
the Rural Opportunity Investment Conference. By bringing together private sector
leaders, government officials, and academic scholars, the symposium will broaden
opportunities for partnering, provide a venue for sharing knowledge and best
practices, and promote economic growth.
 The Build America Investment Initiative. The Administration is committed to
increasing public private partnerships and collaboration on U.S. infrastructure.
Just last week, the President announced the new Build America Investment
Initiative, which will use executive authorities to increase the flow of private
capital into transportation, water, energy and other infrastructure sectors. The
ROI conference will directly inform the ongoing work of the Build America
Initiative, helping federal agencies to encourage more investment into rural
communities and to key rural infrastructure sectors.
 The Rural Health Philanthropy Partnership. This partnership between the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Rural Health Policy,
Grantmakers in Health and the National Rural Health Association includes more
than 30 State and regional Foundations and Trusts that seek to improve health
care in rural communities. In 2015, the Partnership is undertaking a Rural
Funding Challenge with HHS dedicating $5 million and seeking a matched effort
from the philanthropic community.

White House Rural Council's Sustained Support for the Rural Economy

Today's announcements build on three years of sustained work by the White House
Rural Council to expand opportunity in all corners of rural America. The Rural
Council has over twenty policy accomplishments supporting rural America in four
priority areas: quality of life, innovation, economic opportunity, and
conservation. These advancements will help ensure the development of a rural
economy built to last. These actions include:

Increasing Capital Access for Rural Small Businesses

USDA and SBA committed to providing $175 million in microloans to small
businesses in rural areas for Fiscal Years 2013 and 2014, in addition to new
business training and counseling opportunities. To date the two agencies have
supported over $85 million to rural small businesses.

Accelerating Broadband Infrastructure Deployment

On June 14, 2012 President Obama signed an Executive Order to make broadband
construction along Federal roadways and properties up to 90 percent cheaper and
more efficient. U.S agencies that manage Federal properties and roads are
partnering to offer carriers a single approach to leasing Federal assets for
broadband deployment. Providing a uniform approach for broadband carriers to
build networks is speeding the delivery of connectivity to communities,
business, and schools in rural America. In order to further expand the nation's
broadband service, more than 25 cities and 60 national research universities are
partnering to form "US Ignite." US Ignite is creating a new wave of services
that will extend programmable broadband networks to 100 times the speed of
today's internet. To further leverage private-sector involvement, a three-day
Application Summit was conducted this June at the headquarters of Juniper
Networks in Silicon Valley. This session made numerous connections that will
strengthen rural and urban communities through innovative broadband
applications. In total, this partnership will improve services to Americans and
drive job creation, promote innovation, and create new markets for American
business.

U.S Department of Education Investing in Rural Schools

Through the national broadband plan, the Obama Administration is leveraging the
power of technology to overcome distance and increase collaboration to
accelerate student achievement in rural schools. The White House Rural Council
partnered with the U.S Department of Education to deliver a new online community
of practice groups for rural schools. This online tool is creating virtual
communities of practice for educators to connect to resources, tools,
colleagues, experts, and learned activities both within and beyond schools. As
part of the push for broadband in public schools, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) is investing $2 billion over the next two years to dramatically
expand high-speed Internet connectivity for America's schools and libraries --
connecting 20 million more students to next-generation broadband and wireless.
Private-sector companies have also committed more than $2 billion to deliver
cutting-edge technologies to classrooms. The Administration is using technology
to break down geographic barriers and address rural isolation in education.

Local Food, Local Places

Recognizing the role local food systems can play in regional economic
development, the Administration launched Local Food, Local Places in June, 2014.
This effort, a partnership between the US Department of Agriculture, the US
Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional Commission, provides
direct technical assistance to twenty communities integrating local food
production into their civic planning process.

Small Business Administration Investing in Rural Small Businesses

The Administration extended more than $400 million in FY 2011 of investments in
rural America through the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Impact
Investment Program, at no cost to taxpayers. Nearly $2 billion in additional
funding will be invested by the end of fiscal year 2016. These investments will
continue to help finance, grow, expand, and modernize rural small business
operations around the country.

Promoting a Bioeconomy through BioPreferred

To support the Administration's "Blueprint for a Bioeconomy," the President is
utilizing the purchasing power of the Federal government by directing Federal
agencies to take additional steps to significantly increase the purchase of
biobased products over the next two years, which will create thousands of new
rural jobs and drive innovation where biobased products are grown and
manufactured. Utilizing the existing BioPreferred program, the Federal
government will use its procurement power to increase the purchasing and use of
biobased products, promoting rural economic development, creating new jobs, and
providing new markets for farm commodities. Biobased products include items like
paints, soaps and detergents and are developed from plants, rather than
chemicals or petroleum bases. The biobased products sector marries the two most
important economic engines for rural America: agriculture and manufacturing.

Rural Jobs Accelerator

The "Rural Jobs Accelerator" links Federal programs to facilitate job creation
and economic development in rural communities by utilizing regional development
strategies. The "Rural Jobs Accelerator" allows multiple agencies to coordinate
technical assistance and grant/loan programs so that a consortium of public and
private rural entities can have a single access point within the Federal
government, creating improved access, streamlining of programs, and better
leveraging of resources. USDA, EDA, Delta Regional Authority, and Appalachian
Regional Commission have leveraged approximately $9 million in funding, with
additional technical support from various Federal agencies including Department
of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Education.

Commercial Aviation Biofuels Partnership

The Navy, the Department of Energy, and USDA have joined forces to spur the
creation of an advanced biofuels industry that will support commercial aviation,
with a pledge of $510 million, over three years, under the Defense Production
Act of 1950.

Unprecedented Investments in Rural America

Historic Investment in Rural America

U.S. Department of Agriculture

The White House Rural Council is chaired by Secretary Vilsack, who in his role
as Secretary of the Department of Agriculture has made unprecedented
state-by-state investments in rural America. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
works with thousands of farmers, ranchers and others living in rural communities
every day and knows that there is no limit to the economic potential of rural
America. Over the past five years, USDA has made significant investments to
support those in rural America who drive the rural economy forward, carry out
record conservation efforts, facilitate groundbreaking research, promote new
markets for rural products, and provide a safe, affordable and nutritious food
supply for American families. Secretary Vilsack invites the private sector to
continue building innovative partnerships that drive investments, economic
growth, and prosperity.

It's Time GOP Introduced Its ObamaCare Alternative

BYLINE: LEWIS K. UHLER AND PETER J. FERRARA ** Uhler** Ferrara

SECTION: ISSUES & INSIGHTS; VIEWPOINT; Pg. A13

LENGTH: 943 words


The bad news keeps rolling in on ObamaCare. More and more people are discovering
that if they like their plan they can't keep it if their insurance company or
their employer cancels it in response to the new regulatory burdens of
ObamaCareIndeed, more people are finding out they can't even keep their jobs if
they like them if their employer downsizes their jobs to part-time to evade the
ObamaCare employer mandate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a record 28.2
million workers are now part-time, while millions of full-time jobs have been
lost.

Is the emergence of a 30-hour workweek -- requiring many people to seek two jobs
or just opt for unemployment insurance and/or welfare and food stamps -- the
"restoration of the middle class" President Obama has been touting "on the
trail" recently?

More and more people are struggling with the individual mandate forcing them to
buy the more expensive insurance the government insists they must buy, rather
than what they want. The Catholic church is struggling with the imperious
Kathleen Sebelius' order that it must pay for health insurance that covers
abortion, while the deeply religious Liberty University in Virginia deals with
government orders to buy health insurance that pays for contraceptives.

Now comes news that the United Parcel Service is cutting back on health
insurance for spouses of employees, to counter rising Obama Care costs. The
University of Virginia is doing the same. Delta Air Lines reports that Obama
Care is increasing the costs of its employee health plan by $100 million next
year.

And the Nevada Food and Commercial Workers Union recently complained bitterly to
Sen. Harry Reid that ObamaCare is killing their health plan with prohibitive
taxes. They said they like their health plan but they can't keep it after all.
The same problem is threatening the health plans of 20 million other union
workers.

What we are observing is the "law of unintended consequences" writ large with
ObamaCare. Its requirements and regulations are bad enough. But the real story
is the collateral damage, apparently unanticipated, that has precipitated a
cascade of calls for ObamaCare's repeal.

Obama's hometown Chicago Tribune, surveying all this wreckage, recently joined
Republicans calling for the law to be repealed. All of this, in fact, is opening
broad opportunity for Republicans to renew pursuit of their original strategy to
repeal and replace ObamaCare.

The centerpiece of the Republican alternative is to expand the tax benefits
currently applied only to employer health insurance to everyone equally. That
can be accomplished through a fixed-dollar, refundable tax credit for everyone
providing roughly $2,500 or so toward the purchase of health insurance. The
fixed-dollar amount provides incentives to shop for the lowest-cost health
insurance, such as health savings accounts, which also include powerful, proven
incentives to control health care costs.

That credit is included in the bill introduced by a physician, Rep. Tom Price,
R-Ga., and in the health plan proposed by the National Center for Policy
Analysis (NCPA) in Dallas.

Another plank common to GOP health policy is to block grant Medicaid to the
states. It's the same model as the enormously successful 1996 welfare reform
block grants that replaced the New Deal-era Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program. Instead of federal dollars going to states on a matching
formula that paid the states more when states spent more, the new block grants
pay each state a fixed, finite amount regardless of what the state spends.

If the state changes to the program increase costs, each state then pays 100% of
that increase itself. But if the state changes reduce costs, perhaps by getting
AFDC dependents out to work, each state keeps 100% of that savings itself.

Under the resulting changed incentives for the states, within a few years
two-thirds of those dependent on AFDC went to work instead. Their incomes were
consequently documented to rise by 25%, while after 10 years costs to taxpayers
declined by 50%, in real dollars, from prior trends.

Doing the same for Medicaid would empower the states to adopt reforms that would
enable their poor to get better health care than under Medicaid, perhaps through
vouchers on top of the tax credit for the purchase of private health insurance,
including health savings accounts.

The emerging Republican plans also include high-risk pools for the uninsured who
have become too sick to get new insurance in the market. These uninsured would
get coverage from the pool for all their pre-existing conditions, for
means-tested premiums, with taxpayer subsidies as necessary.

John Goodman, president of NCPA, has proposed allowing the tax credit to be used
by anyone to buy into Medicaid if they want, which would ensure available
coverage for everyone and any pre-existing condition. ObamaCare, by contrast,
promised but does not achieve universal coverage, with CBO estimating 30 million
will still be uninsured 10 years after full implementation!

Such GOP reforms would assure health care for all, with no job-killing employer
mandate, and no individual mandate, at a savings of $2 trillion over the first
10 years alone compared to current law. The public would wildly embrace such an
alternative, in the most dramatic turnaround in U.S. political history. That is
the Republican opportunity on ObamaCare.

A Labor Day Carol

BYLINE: By Joseph Sabino Mistick

LENGTH: 463 words


If Charles Dickens were to write a Labor Day version of  "A Christmas Carol," he
would have found all the prerequisite ghosts marching with the faithful in
Pittsburgh's Labor Day Parade last Monday.

Nearly 50,000 unionists and supporters gathered in the Lower Hill and made their
way through Downtown, carrying the banners and wearing the colors of their
locals, keeping all the old traditions.

Moms and dads marched with the kids, teaching them about community and loyalty
and solidarity, introducing them to co-workers so they could finally match faces
to the names they heard around the dinner table.

There were politicians and glad-handers and lots of hot coffee before and cold
beer after.

The ghost of Labor Day Past, always a welcome visitor, keeps all those old
traditions alive.

The ghost of Labor Day Present was also there, marking a break with society's
past. Members of the Delta Foundation, representing the lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender community marched at the invitation of the Service Employees
International Union Local 16.

As one veteran labor leader said, "Our children and grandchildren don't put up
with those old prejudices, and we don't either."

On its website, Delta praised the union for "fighting for equality and ensuring
that all working people can live with dignity." It is surely a new day.

And Dickens would have found his Scrooge here as he considered the ghost of
Labor Day Future, a future in which the robber barons of old are replaced with a
slicker breed of big bosses, their avarice hidden just beneath a veneer of
supposed charitable intent.

Hundreds of marchers protested against UPMC, a taxpayer-subsidized health care
giant that pays its executives millions and coddles them like sultans with
private jets and gourmet dining while tearing down a hospital in Braddock that
served the poor because it was not profitable.

Support for the efforts of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania to organize service
workers at UPMC cut across all the unions that marched on Monday, with many
workers carrying signs that set the theme, demanding that "UPMC Stop Bullying
Pittsburgh."

When our beloved nuns ran the hospitals and schools for no salaries at all,
folks willingly worked for very little, donating their own labor to the
community. The corporate titans that now reign are devoted to themselves and
average workers are fighting for a better deal. That will keep the ghost of
Labor Day Future busy for a while.

Dickens knew how to conjure up a good ending. In "A Christmas Carol," miserly
Scrooge found redemption and the morality tale ended on notes of hope, love and
generosity.

We should be so lucky.

The Atlanta Project has filled one of its most important staff positions with
the selection of Gerry Conroy as volunteer coordinator.

Mr. Conroy, 46, the former director of the Southeast Center for Justice in
Atlanta, will be responsible for organizing more than 100,000 volunteers who
have already signed on to help solve some of the city's most distressing social
ills.

"Gerry's past work with programs fostering grass-roots community action, racial
harmony and justice will be invaluable in training and activating the volunteers
to work as partners with community residents in the clusters," said Dan Sweat,
overall coordinator of the project.

At the Southeast Center for Justice, which he co-founded, Mr. Conroy headed a
non-profit organization devoted to addressing the issues of racism, youth at
risk, women in poverty and workers' rights in six Southeastern states.

"The challenge and the opportunity," Mr. Conroy said, "will be to match
resources with needs, all in direct response to the goals set by the clusters.
This dynamic is central to community empowerment."

Besides Mr. Conroy, Mr. Sweat said, there have been nine other staff additions
over the past several weeks that had not been announced. They include:

Marion Adams, who was special projects director for Communicorp, will serve as
liaison between The Atlanta Project and The Carter Center.

Vernell Britton, chief of the quality control program of the Health Care
Financing Administration, is a loaned executive working with the secretariat
member in charge of health.

Dr. Leonard Jack is on loan from the Morehouse School of Medicine and will also
assist ith health issues.

Gwen Davis, former public affairs consultant for the Metropolitan Community
Foundation and the Empty Stocking Fund, is communications coordinator.

Elise Eplan, founder of Hands On Atlanta, is project manager for a Carnegie
Corp. grant to the project.

Nancy Gresham-Jones, a former vice president of community reinvestment at
Chemical Bank in New York, is an assistant to the secretariat member in charge
of housing.

Edward Irons, dean of the School of Business at Clark Atlanta University, is a
senior adviser on economic development.

Patricia K. Statome, who works in financial management at Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc., will be a financial adviser to the project.

Pam Taylor, a supervisor for data analysis at Delta Air Lines, will be an
administrative specialist and develop procedures for personnel and the use of
facilities.

overall coordinator of the project.

At the Southeast Center for Justice, which he co-founded, Mr. Conroy headed a
non-profit organization devoted to addressing the issues of racism, youth at
risk, women in poverty, and workers' rights in six southeastern states.

"The challenge and the opportunity," Mr. Conroy said, "will be to match
resources with needs, all in direct response to the goals set by the clusters.
This dynamic is central to community empowerment."

Besides Mr. Conroy, Mr. Sweat said, there have been nine other staff additions
over the past several weeks that had not been announced. They include:

Marion Adams, who was special projects director for Communicorp, will serve as
liaison between The Atlanta Project and The Carter Center.

Vernell Britton, chief of the quality control program of the Health Care
Financing Administration, is a loaned executive working with the secretariat
member in charge of health.

Dr. Leonard Jack is on loan from the Morehouse School of Medicine and will also
assist with health issues.

Gwen Davis, former public affairs consultant for the Metropolitan Community
Foundation and the Empty Stocking Fund, is communications coordinator.

Elise Eplan, founder of Hands on Atlanta, is project manager for a Carnegie
Corporation grant to the project.

Nancy Gresham-Jones, a former vice president of community reinvestment at
Chemical Bank in New York, is an assistant to the secretariat member in charge
of housing.

Dr. Edward Irons, dean of the School of Business at Clark Atlanta University, is
a senior adviser on economic development.

Patricia K. Statome, who works in financial management at Coca-Cola Enterprises
Inc., will be a financial adviser to the project.

Pam Taylor, a supervisor for data analysis at Delta Air Lines, will be an
administrative specialist and develop procedures for personnel and the use of
facilities.

Delta gets vote on hospital tax hike: Increase is aimed at keeping emergency
room open all day

SOURCE: Vancouver Sun

BYLINE: Pamela Fayerman

SECTION: News; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 556 words

Voters in Delta's municipal election next month will be asked if they would pay
1.25 per cent more in property taxes to keep the hospital's emergency department
staffed and open 24 hours a day.

Mayor Lois Jackson said in an interview Tuesday that after more than six months
of debating what to do to preserve the emergency department, the council is
unanimous that voters should be asked what they want.

Under a budget-cutting plan threatened by the regional health authority and the
provincial government, a doctor would only be on-call in emergency from midnight
to 8 a.m., so patients requiring emergency care would have to go to Richmond or
Surrey instead.

A bylaw to place the question on the Nov. 16 ballot passed three readings at the
last council meeting and a fourth reading is expected to pass next week.

Jackson said she is pleased with the achievement, considering that five months
ago council voted down a tax increase proposal in a tie vote.

Councillors George Hawksworth, Krista Engelland and Vicki Huntington opposed the
special levy, on the grounds that the provincial government and regional health
authority were just off-loading health care expenses on to municipal
governments.

Commenting on the turnaround, Jackson said:

"There is an election coming up, you know. And the residents of Delta have made
it pretty clear that they want their emergency services preserved."

The 1.25 per cent would amount to about $11 per year in additional taxes for a
house assessed at $245,000, Jackson said, noting that various people have
compared the increase to a few cups of cappuccino or an inexpensive bottle of
wine.

"I know that people say you can't govern by public opinion polls, but the
government isn't all-knowing. We need to gauge public support. And one way or
another we've got to look after people just like we do with our police, fire and
ambulance services," she said. Until 1998, she added, the municipality collected
a Greater Vancouver Regional District hospital levy from property taxpayers, so
the proposed tax increase wouldn't be precedent setting.

If the November vote shows a majority supports the proposed tax increase, Delta
will offer to forward the money raised through the increase to the Fraser Health
Authority in the form of an annual operating grant, on the condition that
emergency services are maintained at current levels.

But the authority could turn down the proposal and proceed with its plan to cut
services.

Because of that, Jackson said, council is also sticking to its August decision
to have legal staff prepare to file an injunction against the health authority
if it decides to go ahead with a reduction of emergency services.

"Much of the legal work has been completed in order to be in a position to move
quickly to commence an action seeking an injunction in the event that the
ongoing consultation process does not resolve this matter to the municipality's
satisfaction," according to a council report.

It costs about $800,000 a year to maintain emergency care at the hospital with a
doctor, two critical care nurses and three patient beds 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.

The Fraser Health Authority has said it will maintain the emergency services in
their current form until at least the end of the year.

Washington: FACT SHEET: The White House Rural Forum

LENGTH: 1844  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: White House Administration has issued the following news release:



  Tomorrow, Wednesday, October 5, the White House will host the White House
Rural Forum, convening rural policy, business, and nonprofit leaders to Penn
State University in State College, PA, and announcing new Administration actions
in support of rural America. At tomorrow's convening, Agriculture Secretary Tom
Vilsack, Chair of the White House Rural Council, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom
Wolf will lead discussions on pertinent issues facing rural communities,
including opportunities for economic growth and strategies for improving health
care and housing. Secretary Vilsack will also urge lawmakers and the private
sector, foundations, and nonprofits to recognize opportunities in America's
rural communities to ensure continued social and economic progress.





 Significant gains have been made across rural America: Rural household income
climbed 3.4 percent in 2015, and overall poverty and food insecurity fell
dramatically, rural populations have begun to rebound, and non-metro areas have
added more than 250,000 jobs since 2014, while the share of rural Americans
without health insurance is now at an all-time low.



 Established by President Obama in 2011, the White House Rural Council
coordinates the Administration's efforts in rural America by streamlining and
improving the effectiveness of federal programs, engaging stakeholders on
priority issues, and coordinating private sector partnerships to create economic
opportunity and improve the quality of life.



 Building on the work of the White House Rural Council, today the Administration
and non-Federal organizations are announcing new investments and highlighting
programs to support continued progress in rural America, including:



              $3 Billion Invested in Rural Infrastructure Projects: In 2014,
USDA launched a public-private partnership with Capitol Peak Asset Management
and CoBank, a national cooperative bank and member of the Farm Credit System.
Since 2014, more than $3 billion in private sector funding has been lent to over
400 financings of projects in the power, water, communications and community
facilities industries.

              $7.7 Million in New Grants to Bring Broadband to 6 Unserved
Communities: USDA's Community Connect program provides funding for broadband
deployment into unserved areas. Since 2009, USDA Rural Development broadband
programs have helped bring high-speed Internet access to nearly 6 million rural
residents and businesses.

              $24.4 Million to Fund 80 New Efforts to Support Rural Businesses:
Since 2009, USDA has invested $11 billion to start or expand 103,000 rural
businesses; helped 1.1 million rural residents buy homes; funded nearly 7,000
community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care facilities;
and financed 180,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines. New
investments announced today:

            $10.9 million invested in 15 new Rural Economic Development Loan
(REDL) and Grant (REDG) projects: Under the REDLoan and REDGrant programs, USDA
provides zero interest loans and grants to local utilities which they, in turn,
pass through to local businesses (ultimate recipients) for projects that will
create and retain employment in rural areas.

            $9.1 million invested in 15 new Intermediary Relending Program (IRP)
projects: Under the IRP program, loans are provided to local organizations
(intermediaries) for the establishment of revolving loan funds. These revolving
loan funds are used to assist with financing business and economic development
activity to create or retain jobs in disadvantaged and remote communities.
Intermediaries are encouraged to work in concert with partners who can provide
complimentary resources.

            $1.2 million invested in 4 new Rural Micro-entrepreneur Assistance
Program (RMAP) projects: RMAP provides loans and grants to Microenterprise
Development Organizations (MDOs) to help micro-entrepreneurs - very small
businesses with 10 or fewer employees - access capital to start or grow
businesses. MDOs use the funds to provide training and technical assistance to
small businesses or to establish revolving loan funds that provide micro-loans,
typically $5,000 to $50,000, to rural micro-entrepreneurs.

            $3.2 million invested in 46 new Rural Business Development Grant
(RBDG) projects: RBDG is a competitive grant designed to support targeted
technical assistance, training and other activities leading to the development
or expansion of small and emerging private businesses in rural areas that have
fewer than 50 employees and less than $1 million in gross revenues.

              Grants to Increase Rural Veterans' Access to Health Care: The
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Rural Health is awarding $215
million in grants for FY2017 to 138 VA Medical Centers to prioritize rural
programs to increase access to health care services impacting approximately
570,000 rural Veterans and approximately 800 rural providers and health care
staff. These grants will support the implementation of proven models of care
delivery in rural serving clinics. Programs enhancing Primary Care, Mental
Health Care, Specialty Care and Enabling Services will be available in VA clinic
locations where these were not previously available.

              Investing in volunteer service to address the opioid crisis in
Rural America:  The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will
provide up to 19 AmeriCorps program development grants to states and their
governors' service commissions to address the growing opioid crisis in America,
including in rural areas of affected States. AmeriCorps VISTA just announced
that one of its FY2017 priorities for applications is to have members promote
opioid addiction recovery. Last year, CNCS invested $220 million in programs
that help rural communities address their biggest challenges.  More than 190,000
AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps members served their rural neighbors in every state
through tasks like tutoring children, building or repairing homes, and providing
nutritious meals.

              Rural IMPACT Demonstration pilot program: The Rural Integration
Models for Parents and Children to Thrive (Rural IMPACT) Demonstration Project
helps communities adopt a two-generation approach to addressing the needs of
both vulnerable children and their parents, with the goal of increasing parents'
employment and education and improving the health and well-being of their
children and families. The project, led by HHS in collaboration with USDA, the
Department of Labor (DOL), CNCS, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta
Regional Authority, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and
other philanthropic partners selected 10 local and tribal communities to receive
interagency technical assistance and capacity-building resources to reduce child
poverty. Today, USDA and CNCS are pleased to announce that AmeriCorps VISTA
members will be placed in all 10 Rural IMPACT communities for a second year.

              Economic Development Planning Assistance for Rural Communities:
Several agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA, the
Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and
Human Services, the Economic Development Administration, the Appalachian
Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority, is launching Rural
Advantage, offering planning assistance to help up to 30 rural communities grow
their economies and revitalize downtown neighborhoods. Rural Advantage joins a
suite of Federal economic development planning assistance programs for rural
communities that include:

            Local Foods, Local Places, which helps communities leverage local
food enterprise to diversify their economy and renew their downtowns;

            Cool & Connected, which helps communities use broadband service to
create walkable, connected, economically successful neighborhoods; and

            Healthy Places for Healthy People, a new program that will help
communities use centrally located health care facilities to promote community
development and active living.



 Communities interested in assistance are invited to apply by November 6th.



              Health Information Technology Investments: HHS's Health Resources
and Services Administration (HRSA) is investing approximately $36 million in
rurally-located health centers to support strategic investments in Health
Information Technology. The investments will help health centers enhance their
health IT and better prepare providers and staff to use health IT and data.

              Investments to Address Chronic Diseases: HRSA is investing $2
million to support rural primary care providers, such as critical access
hospitals and rural health clinics, to plan and implement quality improvement
activities such as medication management, to address chronic diseases including
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.

              Community Coaches to Help Rural Leaders Tackle Child Poverty: The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin are providing
Community Coaches to ten innovative communities participating in the Rural
Impact County Challenge, an initiative led by the White House Rural Council and
the National Association of Counties to address rural child poverty. Coaches
will work directly with selected communities' leaders and multi-sector teams to
address factors that contribute to child poverty.

              Investments in Rural Teacher Preparation Programs: As part of its
Teacher Quality Partnership Grants Program, the Department of Education is
investing nearly $15 million over five years to develop teacher preparation
programs at higher education institutions that partner with high-need schools to
help train new and experienced teachers.

              Release of "Rural Strategies that Work": The White House Rural
Council is releasing a memorandum entitled Rural Strategies that Work, which
presents strategies for Federal work in rural America that have resulted in
improved outcomes over the course of the Obama Administration. Authored by
Secretary Vilsack, Office and Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan,
Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Muñoz and National Economic Council Director
Jeff Zients, the memorandum presents policies and administrative actions that
increase rural communities' ability to access and leverage local and Federal
resources.

              Highlighting the accomplishments of the White House Rural Council:
Secretary Vilsack is publishing a new Medium Post that highlights the work of
the White House Rural Council and the organizations with which it works. The
post contains stories and videos of Federal-local collaborations to drive
economic growth, improve rural quality of life, and expand access to healthcare
in rural America.

to weigh in on changes that Rio Vista has proposed to improve the service this
fall.

One possibility is reintroducing daily bus service between Isleton, Rio Vista,
Suisun City and Fairfield, as well as once-a-week service to Lodi.

The change calls for Route 50 buses to operate from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.
weekdays, connecting the four communities. Buses would stop on request anywhere
in each city as well as at bus stops for those who want to transfer.

As for Route 51, buses would operate from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays as well as from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 to 3:30 p.m.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the route would operate from 2:45 to 5 p.m. and would
be extended to serve resorts along the Delta Loop Recreation Area and Oxbow
Marina.

On Route 53 -- a new route -- buses would operate on Tuesdays along State Route
12 between Trilogy Vista clubhouse in Rio Vista, downtown Rio Vista, Delta Loop
Recreation Area, Terminous, Flag City and Lodi.

Making these changes possible is a grant from the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission, which wants to make rural areas more accessible to low-income people
as well as give them greater access to jobs, shopping, medical care and
education.

To register your opinion, call John Andoh at 707-374-5337 or e-mail
jandoh@ci.rio -vista.ca.us.

Comments also can be mailed to Andoh at the city of Rio Vista, 1 Main Street,
Rio Vista, CA 94571 or faxed to 707-374-5319.

Washington: FACT SHEET: The White House Rural Forum

LENGTH: 1857  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



  Tomorrow, on Wednesday, October 5, the White House will host the White House
Rural Forum, convening rural policy, business, and nonprofit leaders to Penn
State University in State College, PA, and announcing new Administration actions
in support of rural America. At tomorrow's convening, Agriculture Secretary Tom
Vilsack, Chair of the White House Rural Council, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom
Wolf will lead discussions on pertinent issues facing rural communities,
including opportunities for economic growth and strategies for improving health
care and housing. Secretary Vilsack will also urge lawmakers and the private
sector, foundations, and nonprofits to recognize opportunities in America's
rural communities to ensure continued social and economic progress.





 Significant gains have been made across rural America: Rural household income
climbed 3.4 percent in 2015, and overall poverty and food insecurity fell
dramatically, rural populations have begun to rebound, and non-metro areas have
added more than 250,000 jobs since 2014, while the share of rural Americans
without health insurance is now at an all-time low.



 Established by President Obama in 2011, the White House Rural Council
coordinates the Administration's efforts in rural America by streamlining and
improving the effectiveness of federal programs, engaging stakeholders on
priority issues, and coordinating private sector partnerships to create economic
opportunity and improve the quality of life.



 Building on the work of the White House Rural Council, today the Administration
and non-Federal organizations are announcing new investments and highlighting
programs to support continued progress in rural America, including:



     $3 Billion Invested in Rural Infrastructure Projects: In 2014, USDA
launched a public-private partnership with Capitol Peak Asset Management and
CoBank, a national cooperative bank and member of the Farm Credit System. Since
2014, more than $3 billion in private sector funding has been lent to over 400
financings of projects in the power, water, communications and community
facilities industries.

     $7.7 Million in New Grants to Bring Broadband to 6 Unserved Communities:
USDA's Community Connect program provides funding for broadband deployment into
unserved areas. Since 2009, USDA Rural Development broadband programs have
helped bring high-speed Internet access to nearly 6 million rural residents and
businesses.

     $24.4 Million to Fund 80 New Efforts to Support Rural Businesses: Since
2009, USDA has invested $11 billion to start or expand 103,000 rural businesses;
helped 1.1 million rural residents buy homes; funded nearly 7,000 community
facilities such as schools, public safety and health care facilities; and
financed 180,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines. New
investments announced today:

     $10.9 million invested in 15 new Rural Economic Development Loan (REDL) and
Grant (REDG) projects: Under the REDLoan and REDGrant programs, USDA provides
zero interest loans and grants to local utilities which they, in turn, pass
through to local businesses (ultimate recipients) for projects that will create
and retain employment in rural areas.

     $9.1 million invested in 15 new Intermediary Relending Program (IRP)
projects: Under the IRP program, loans are provided to local organizations
(intermediaries) for the establishment of revolving loan funds. These revolving
loan funds are used to assist with financing business and economic development
activity to create or retain jobs in disadvantaged and remote communities.
Intermediaries are encouraged to work in concert with partners who can provide
complimentary resources.

     $1.2 million invested in 4 new Rural Micro-entrepreneur Assistance Program
(RMAP) projects: RMAP provides loans and grants to Microenterprise Development
Organizations (MDOs) to help micro-entrepreneurs - very small businesses with 10
or fewer employees - access capital to start or grow businesses. MDOs use the
funds to provide training and technical assistance to small businesses or to
establish revolving loan funds that provide micro-loans, typically $5,000 to
$50,000, to rural micro-entrepreneurs.

     $3.2 million invested in 46 new Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG)
projects: RBDG is a competitive grant designed to support targeted technical
assistance, training and other activities leading to the development or
expansion of small and emerging private businesses in rural areas that have
fewer than 50 employees and less than $1 million in gross revenues.

     Grants to Increase Rural Veterans' Access to Health Care: The Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Rural Health is awarding $215 million in grants
for FY2017 to 138 VA Medical Centers to prioritize rural programs to increase
access to health care services impacting approximately 570,000 rural Veterans
and approximately 800 rural providers and health care staff. These grants will
support the implementation of proven models of care delivery in rural serving
clinics. Programs enhancing Primary Care, Mental Health Care, Specialty Care and
Enabling Services will be available in VA clinic locations where these were not
previously available.

     Investing in volunteer service to address the opioid crisis in Rural
America: The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will provide
up to 19 AmeriCorps program development grants to states and their governors'
service commissions to address the growing opioid crisis in America, including
in rural areas of affected States. AmeriCorps VISTA just announced that one of
its FY2017 priorities for applications is to have members promote opioid
addiction recovery. Last year, CNCS invested $220 million in programs that help
rural communities address their biggest challenges. More than 190,000 AmeriCorps
and SeniorCorps members served their rural neighbors in every state through
tasks like tutoring children, building or repairing homes, and providing
nutritious meals.

     Rural IMPACT Demonstration pilot program: The Rural Integration Models for
Parents and Children to Thrive (Rural IMPACT) Demonstration Project helps
communities adopt a two-generation approach to addressing the needs of both
vulnerable children and their parents, with the goal of increasing parents'
employment and education and improving the health and well-being of their
children and families. The project, led by HHS in collaboration with USDA, the
Department of Labor (DOL), CNCS, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta
Regional Authority, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and
other philanthropic partners selected 10 local and tribal communities to receive
interagency technical assistance and capacity-building resources to reduce child
poverty. Today, USDA and CNCS are pleased to announce that AmeriCorps VISTA
members will be placed in all 10 Rural IMPACT communities for a second year.

     Economic Development Planning Assistance for Rural Communities: Several
agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA, the
Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and
Human Services, the Economic Development Administration, the Appalachian
Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority, is launching Rural
Advantage, offering planning assistance to help up to 30 rural communities grow
their economies and revitalize downtown neighborhoods. Rural Advantage joins a
suite of Federal economic development planning assistance programs for rural
communities that include:

     Local Foods, Local Places, which helps communities leverage local food
enterprise to diversify their economy and renew their downtowns;

     Cool & Connected, which helps communities use broadband service to create
walkable, connected, economically successful neighborhoods; and

     Healthy Places for Healthy People, a new program that will help communities
use centrally located health care facilities to promote community development
and active living.



 Communities interested in assistance are invited to apply by November 6th.



     Health Information Technology Investments: HHS's Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA) is investing approximately $36 million in
rurally-located health centers to support strategic investments in Health
Information Technology. The investments will help health centers enhance their
health IT and better prepare providers and staff to use health IT and data.

     Investments to Address Chronic Diseases: HRSA is investing $2 million to
support rural primary care providers, such as critical access hospitals and
rural health clinics, to plan and implement quality improvement activities such
as medication management, to address chronic diseases including diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and obesity.

     Community Coaches to Help Rural Leaders Tackle Child Poverty: The Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin are providing Community
Coaches to ten innovative communities participating in the Rural Impact County
ChallengeThis is an external link or third-party site outside of the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website., an initiative led by the White
House Rural Council and the National Association of Counties to address rural
child poverty. Coaches will work directly with selected communities' leaders and
multi-sector teams to address factors that contribute to child poverty.

     Investments in Rural Teacher Preparation Programs: As part of its Teacher
Quality Partnership Grants Program, the Department of Education is investing
nearly $15 million over five years to develop teacher preparation programs at
higher education institutions that partner with high-need schools to help train
new and experienced teachers.

     Release of "Rural Strategies that Work": The White House Rural Council is
releasing a memorandum entitled Rural Strategies that Work, which presents
strategies for Federal work in rural America that have resulted in improved
outcomes over the course of the Obama Administration. Authored by Secretary
Vilsack, Office and Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan, Domestic
Policy Director Cecilia Muñoz and National Economic Council Director Jeff
Zients, the memorandum presents policies and administrative actions that
increase rural communities' ability to access and leverage local and Federal
resources.

     Highlighting the accomplishments of the White House Rural Council:
Secretary Vilsack is publishing a new Medium PostThis is an external link or
third-party site outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website. that highlights the work of the White House Rural Council and the

Free health screenings reach hundreds

Jan. 13--STOCKTON -- Four University of the Pacific pharmacy students turned an
ambitious vision into reality Saturday with the help of scores of sponsors and
volunteers, drawing approximately 300 people to a San Joaquin Delta College
parking lot for free health screenings.

Pacific students Kate Lee, Chris Chan, Shelley Matsumura and Miguel Cobian
presented the plan as part of a Pharmacy Leadership Society competition last
year. They were awarded first place and a $500 grant to help fund the first of
two Salud Outreach health fairs.

"We have a really high Hispanic population in Stockton, and within the Hispanic
population we have a really high rate of diabetes," Lee said. "Stockton also is
one of the poorest cities in the nation, and San Joaquin County has one of the
top five obesity rates. The reason we have these obesity and health problems is
probably because of poor diet or, because of poverty, people can't go to the
doctor."

The students enlisted the help of supporting partners such as Delta College,
Kaiser Permanente, San Joaquin General Hospital and El Concilio, and found
sponsors such as Tepa Taqueria, Casa Flores and El Torito. They secured space in
the Locke parking lot at Delta, set up tents and found volunteers to staff
stations where they performed free blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes
screenings. They will offer free screenings again Feb. 23.

"It's good for them to do this," Marcel Trejo, a 42-year-old Stockton man, said
through a translator. "It's great for the community because sometimes there is
no money to pay (for health screenings)."

The health fair catered to the Latino community with volunteers who speak
Spanish. Most who received screenings were Latinos who did not speak English,
Lee said. One woman's blood pressure was so high she was taken to a hospital by
ambulance.

Lee said the students were thrilled to receive so much support, pleased with the
turnout and delighted to see their idea come to fruition.

"It feels amazing," Lee said. "I feel so fortunate to be in Stockton, where
there's a big need for health care services for underserved people, and it feels
so amazing when you feel like you're needed by someone."

Aristotle A. Vaseliades, son of Mr. and Mrs. Achilles Vaseliades of Gulfport,
has been selected for membership in the Omicron Delta Kappa Society Inc., the
National Leadership Honor Society. Vaseliades is a junior at Florida Southern
College, Lakeland, on an Army ROTC scholarship. He is a member of Lambda Chi
Alpha fraternity and a 1993 graduate of Northside Christian High School.

   Mark Alan Harman of St. Petersburg has graduated from the La Varenne  Cooking
School at The Greenbrier, a Mobil Five-Star, AAA Five-Diamond resort  in White
Sulphur Springs, W.Va. La Vareene is one of the most influential  culinary
institutions in the world. The professional training program has been  at the
resort since 1957.

   A gentle touch, a sympathetic ear, and a warm smile can mean  a great deal
to a person in a long-term health care facility. Many health care providers
provide  care to residents at the Abbey Nursing Center in St. Petersburg, but
none has been at it as long as Cathy Baker of St. Petersburg.

Baker reached her 25th anniversary at the Abbey in March. The staff held a
surprise party and presented her with a dozen roses and a diamond necklace.

"Making her residents at the Abbey feel special is a goal of Cathy's,"  said
Anita O'Hara, director of nursing.

"She makes an effort every day to give extra hugs and attention to those
assigned to her care," Susan Hunter, administrator added.

Baker also juggles  roles as wife, mother, grandmother, and church choir
member.

   Dr. Gail Cawkwell, a physician at All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg,
has received a doctorate in epidemiology from the University of Cincinnati.

   Patricia D. Reed, an eight-year veteran history teacher at Boca Ciega High
School, is the winner of a $ 2,500 scholarship from the Suncoast Branch of the
English-Speaking Union for summer study in England. Reed, a graduate of the
University of South Florida, teaches world history to about 185 students  daily.
She will enroll in two courses at Exeter College, Oxford University for  three
weeks in July. For information about the award, call 391-9154.

   The Florida Children's Forum, the Voice of the Child Care Network, has
recognized state Rep.  Lars A. Hafner, D-St. Petersburg, as the Leading
Legislator Advocate for Child Care. He was honored for his continuing
commitment to child care solutions for the state of Florida. The award was
presented April 2 as the Florida Children's Forum celebrated Children's Day at
the State Capitol in Tallahassee.

"Rep. Hafner is the leading child care advocate in child care funding. He  has
always been there for us and is the number one person for these kids on  the
waiting lists," said Susan Muenchow, executive director of the Florida
Children's Forum.

Hafner chairs the Health & Human Services Subcommittee of Appropriations,  which
is responsible for child care funding.

INTERNATIONAL ATLANTA;
Ismaili Muslims deeply involved in charity work

BYLINE: Keith Graham

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 19A

LENGTH: 970 words


All too often, the words Muslim and terrorist are linked in the American media
and American minds, but some local believers in Islam are quietly trying to
change the situation.

"One of the parallels we like to give is we do not blame Catholics for the work
of the IRA in Ireland," said Mahmud Jetha, an insurance agent who grew up in
Kenya and moved to Atlanta from Canada.

Jetha, an Ismaili Muslim, is a volunteer for the Aga Khan Foundation, which
earlier this month organized a Stone Mountain walk that raised more than a
half-million dollars for development programs for women and children in Africa
and Asia. The Aga Khan is the spiritual leader of the world's 15 million Ismaili
Muslims, of whom more than 3,000 live in the Atlanta area. Among the programs
that receive Aga Khan funding are a health initiative to improve sanitation and
water sources in Jetha's native Kenya and a project to promote interactive
teaching methods in some of the nation's more crowded and poorly equipped
schools.

Though it works within the Islamic tradition of social concern, the Aga Khan
Foundation ---part of the Aga Khan Development Network of social development
institutions ---is nondenominational, and the majority of the recipients of its
services are not Muslim, said another Ismaili volunteer, Dr. Mansoor N. Saleh,
who divides his time between Atlanta and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he is associate director of clinical
research.

"From our perspective, we want to get something bigger across," said Saleh, who
grew up in Zanzibar. "We want to be able to generate some interest in what is
being done in the world . . . by clearly effective projects. . . . Basically,
what we are saying is 'let's build bridges.' " Jetha added, "What happens in
developing countries is going to affect us in the long run."

The real thing for schools

For schools in the Philippines, things really do go better with Coke. In New
York on Wednesday, the Coca-Cola Co. announced a $ 1 million, five-year
initiative to build schools in rural areas in the island nation. The
announcement was made by Patrick Garner, an Atlanta native who is president of
the company's Philippines Division. The project is funded by The Coca-Cola
Foundation Philippines Inc. and the U.S.-based Coca-Cola Foundation, which is
engaged in worldwide efforts to support education. "Giving children access to
quality education is a long-term investment in the community," Garner said.
"This project is a tangible way for Coca-Cola to help ensure that today's
Filipino children have the capability to build a better tomorrow."

A world of difference

Delta Air Lines and the University of Georgia are introducing a prize they hope
will make a world of difference: Starting in spring 1999, the Delta Prize for
Global Understanding will be presented to individuals or groups who have
promoted peace among cultures and nations. The award will be presented annually
in Atlanta. The prize ---$ 10,000 and an original work of art ---will be funded
by an initial $ 890,000 grant from the Delta Air Lines Foundation. "As a global
airline, Delta knows intercultural understanding is essential to the success of
our communities and businesses," said Maurice Worth, Delta's chief operating
officer. The proposal for the award program was developed by Gary Bertsch,
director of UGA's Center for International Trade and Security, and Betty Jean
Craige, who directs the university's Center for Humanities and Arts.

Diplomatic questions

If you think the Battle of Atlanta happened during the Civil War, you probably
haven't read "Our Man in Belize" by Richard Timothy Conroy (St. Martin's, $
27.50), a memoir of his tenure as U.S. vice consul in Belize, when it was
British Honduras. "The Battle of Atlanta" is a rollicking chapter on the
Tennessee native's oral exams here for the U.S. Foreign Service. Among the
questions: "Do you like country-western music? . . . Why not? Your file says
you're from Tennessee." That was followed by: "Perhaps you could begin by naming
all the ASEAN nations." Though he disappointed his questioners on both counts,
Conroy ultimately convinced them he was "obviously one of us."

A name to watch

Atlanta got a nice mention in a recent issue of the Irish Times ---Atlanta
Rascher, that is. Seems she's a young fashion designer whose latest effort, in
collaboration with Josephine Kilmartin, is "a 'different' bridal collection."
The bridal collection includes a Russian ballerina skirt and top and a cowgirl
outfit with denim jeans and a sequin-covered Stetson.

Alpine adventure

Sarah J. Shapard has taken a leave of absence from the Southern Center for
International Studies, where she served as director of communications and
development. She and her husband, Rob, former associate editor for Atlanta-based
American City & County magazine, arrived in Switzerland last week for an
extended stay. Shapard will help with a school development program there; her
husband will write free-lance articles.

COMPASS POINTS

Israel's ambassador to the United States, Dr. Eliahu Ben-Elissar, is scheduled
to visit Atlanta on Wednesday. . . . A delegation from the German Bundestag
joined an invitation-only group of Atlantans last week at the Southern Center
for International Studies for an off-the-record session on American politics and
possible implications for U.S.-German relations. . . . Huana Weiming, executive
editor of the international news page of the Xinimin Evening News in Shanghai,
China, will swing through Atlanta on a U.S. tour next week. . . . CARE
International has announced a major upgrading of emergency relief in Papua New
Guinea to address acute water and food shortages in the highlands.

Families. Parents will receive a certificate of completion, and the course meets
most court-ordered parenting requirements. The class is appropriate for those
caring for children of all ages.

HMOs collaborate on prevention guidelines

BYLINE: Andy Miller, Staff

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Business; Pg. 1F

LENGTH: 752 words

Local HMOs, normally ferocious competitors for patients, have put aside their
marketing battles to develop a single set of preventive care guidelines.

The goal: improve medical care for metro Atlantans.

This month, wall posters outlining standard prevention measures for children and
adults will be mailed to about 3,500 primary care physicians in metro Atlanta.

Sponsored by the Georgia Healthcare Leadership Council, the posters represent an
unusual collaboration among local HMOs, which traditionally issue their own
standards for care to their physicians.

The posters, targeting patients by age group, will provide recommended schedules
for screenings such as mammograms and blood pressure and cholesterol tests. The
posters will list common vaccines and their recommended frequency, and detail
other health information the doctor should discuss with the patient.

The Leadership Council, an organization of managed care plans and local
employers such as Delta Air Lines, Georgia-Pacific, Lockheed, GTE and UPS, will
hold a news conference today to unveil the standards.

The posters, to be displayed in waiting rooms and exam rooms in doctors'
offices, should stimulate conversation between patients and their physician
about their health, said Julie Johnson of UnitedHealthcare of Georgia, who
helped compile the guidelines.

"If every doctor followed what's here, we'd have a healthier Georgia," Johnson
added.

All local HMOs will be on the same page in terms of immunizations and
screenings. That way, a doctor who treats patients in different HMOs can have a
single reference point, rather than deal with the hassles of determining what
each plan requires.

"We're on some 20 plans, and each one sends information on different things, "
said Dr. Wyndolyn Bell, a Decatur pediatrician who represented the American
Academy of Pediatrics as an adviser on the guidelines.

Atlanta is among the first communities nationally to develop standard prevention
guidelines, according to the Leadership Council.

"Even if we get a 1 percent increase in mammography or immunizations, some
patients will benefit," said Dr. Bruce Perry of Kaiser Permanente, who's
chairman of the Leadership Council.

There's plenty of room to improve. Perry noted that the national average of
eligible female HMO members getting regular mammograms is 72 percent, which is
still higher than the general population.

"The rate of mammography in our city as not as high as other communities,''
noted Dr. Robert Pope, senior medical director of UnitedHealthcare.

Similarly, the national average of children in HMOs getting all early- childhood
immunizations is just 61 percent, Perry said.

Physician practices can vary widely, added Jim Astuto, regional manager of GTE's
health care management group. "You'll ask 10 women what they had in an annual
exam, and you'll get five or six variations," said Astuto, vice chairman of the
Leadership Council.

Because preventive care is central to how a managed care plan works, Astuto
said, "It is important that we not give mixed messages about which preventive
services (consumers) should receive."

The directors of medical quality from each HMO devised the standards, working as
a group called the Quality Council. "In the quality area, we're not as
competitive as sales and marketing," said UnitedHealthcare's Johnson. " We're
doing the same job.''

Following the guidelines can prevent disease, help control a disease in early
stages or improve a sick patient's quality of life, Johnson added.

Only doctors who see HMO patients will receive the posters. But with the spread
of HMOs locally, that may extend to almost all primary care physicians in the
area, said James Purcell, president of the Leadership Council.

Though HMOs will maintain some differences in treatments, Purcell said, area
patients will get the same basic care if they change jobs, or if employers
change health plans.

"Each health plan, when they pick up an employee, will have a healthier
patient," he added.

The preventive standards will be updated regularly. Other upcoming Leadership
Council initiatives involve guidelines for women's health care and standardizing
treatments for asthma and allergy.

Future projects may include creating standards for hospitals on patient safety,
Astuto said. "We want to improve patient safety and reduce medical errors,'' he
said.

Pharmaceutical company Glaxo Wellcome is donating the funds for the posters
through an educational grant.

World Services fosters global ties, citizen diplomats

BYLINE: Mike Tighe, La Crosse Tribune, Wis.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1053 words


Nov. 03--Sandy McCormick belongs to Delta Air Lines' 2-million-mile club, mostly
by virtue of travels to more than 50 countries to extend

La Crosse's helping hand across the globe.

"I don't know how many of the miles are from credit cards," the president and
CEO of World Services of La Crosse Inc. said with a smile in her spartan office
on the city's North Side.

A large chunk came from her 60 trips to Russia and 20 other former Soviet
countries, and more recent trips to Africa.

McCormick traces her international goodwill ambassador role to 1990, when she
worked at then-Lutheran Hospital, and

La Crosse sent a delegation to its sister city of Dubna, Russia.

Delegation leaders included Jack Schwem, Lutheran's CEO, and Dr. Brian Campion,
head of the then-Franciscan Health System, she said.

"They came back and said health care is terrible there -- it needs a lot of
updating," she recalled. "They said, 'Go out and find some money.'

"The Russians had no exposure to Western medicine," she said. "They were still
using surgery and nursing methods we'd used 30 years before."

Russians who got a cold or the flu simply were hospitalized for two or three
weeks, she said.

With connections in Washington, D.C., McCormick was able to obtain grants and
other funding to give the country's health care a heart transplant.

"Because the United States was so interested in supporting Russia at that time,
there was plenty of money," she said. "Because U.S. dollars were involved,
programs had to be sustainable and produce effective results."

Efforts of McCormick and others in La Crosse proved so effective that The New
York Times published a story and editorial Dec. 31, 2000, heralding their
success.

"Doctors and hospitals in La Crosse, Wis.,

have sent a thousand Wisconsinites to Russia to pore over Dubna's health-care
system in the last eight years, and been host to a thousand Dubna residents in
return," the Times reported.

The exchange "literally transformed medical care (in Dubna) and drawn the
attention of several Russian cities anxious to restore their own health,"
according to the Times.

"We were pretty proud of that," McCormick said. "I worked on that until 2000,
but it was never really part of my job."

After retiring as a Gundersen vice president, "I decided to set up World
Services in 2001, with a broader approach than just health care."

The expanded vision has included fostering municipal exchanges with Dubna to
improve city management and services, helping start a domestic violence program
there and coordinating international study tours that bring 150 people from
several countries a year to the United States for 10 days to two weeks.

"Sometimes, they come to La Crosse, but we don't have the capacity for 150, so
we send them to cities all over the country," she said.

Operating on a budget of about $1 million a year from grants and donations,
McCormick and her staff of three "work pretty hard and have a lot done by
volunteers and partnerships.

"We work with both health care systems" to teach global neighbors preventive
care, she said. "People don't think of prevention in those countries."

In partnership with Gundersen Health System and funding from the Bristol-Myers
Squibb Foundation, World Services is working to improve nursing for cancer
patients in Russia, McCormick said.

Another joint effort with Winona State University's School of Nursing aims to
bolster nursing education in Tanzania.

World Services recently coordinated a visit from doctors and nurses from
Tajikistan to learn about the Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare,
Viterbo University's nursing program, Western Technical College's health
sciences program, Scenic Bluffs Community Health Centers, the University of
Wisconsin-Madison Hospital and facilities in Baltimore.

Such forays offer locals the opportunity to be citizen diplomats and hosts.

For example, Jenny and Bruner Hanabarger of Onalaska and their children,
15-year-old Cameron and 18-year-old Brandon, have hosted visitors from Belarus,
Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine.

Jenny and Bruner were accustomed to travel as former members of the military,
where they met in Korea.

"We enjoy meeting people from other countries and learning about their
cultures," Jenny said. Hosting also has been "a really good experience for my
kids because it's important for them to meet other cultures."

Cameron especially enjoyed the recent visit of Khilola Kakharova from Tajikistan
"because she didn't want him to do the dishes. She kept shoving him away," Jenny
said. "He explained that it's a chore. It also was good for her to see a boy
doing dishes."

Hosting involves showing guests to sites such as the Mississippi River and
Grandad Bluff, taking them to various events and generally depicting how a
normal U.S. family lives, she said.

"Shopping is always involved, more with men than women," she said. "Men might
buy a gift for their wife, but women buy lots of gifts and clothes."

Hosting is a "great experience, especially for people with kids," Jenny said.
"It might seem like a lot of work, but it isn't."

World Services also has been able to line up jobs for Russian university
students.

Jake Bowe, owner of Culver's in Onalaska who has hired Russian youths for summer
jobs, cites two advantages in that program.

"Number one, you get somebody who really wants to work because they have to have
a job to be here," he said. "It's also a good cultural exchange for our team
members."

Bowe said he welcomed World Services' request that he hire the youths because he
had similar experiences during a three-month study program in London when he
attended the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse.

"When I was over there, they had a different view of Americans," Bowe said. "It
really opened my eyes. I figured if it was good for me, this would be good for
the Russian kids."

That philosophy mirrors World Services' goals.

"We think we bring a nice dimension to the community," McCormick said. "We bring
in people from all those countries and help La Crosse connect.

"People here open their doors and are very helpful," she said. "Our whole
mission is world peace. When you meet them and get to know them, it's difficult
to hate them."

Delta restricts carrying animals

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 02H

LENGTH: 480 words


Delta Air Lines is warning passengers it won't accept animals as checked baggage
when the temperature exceeds 85 degrees. The airline hopes to avoid a recurrence
of dead pets on its planes, a problem that occurred last summer. Delta said
Friday it now requires passengers to notify the airline of plans to check an
animal as baggage when they book a reservation. The Atlanta-based carrier says
customers traveling with pets in June, July or August should book flights before
noon or after 6 p.m. Several dogs were killed in cargo holds in June when
extreme heat hit much of the nation. The Department of Agriculture's
Animal-Plant Health Inspection Service requires that pets not be checked as
baggage if the animal will be exposed to temperatures below 45 degrees or above
85 degrees for more than 45 minutes in flight.

over the next four years, is lending two electric-powered Ford Rangers to the
zoo. Southern also hopes to gain support for a bill co-sponsored by Reps. Mac
Collins (R-Ga.) and John Lewis (D-Ga.) that would grant $ 4,000 tax credits to
people and businesses that purchase or lease an electric vehicle.

Expo a ray of hope for jobless

Layne Dewlen and Ken Lyons are about as close as friends can get.

Both worked together as airline mechanics. Both attend the same church. They
live three miles apart in Sharpsburg, and this weekend two of their children
will mark their fifth birthdays together by sharing a cake.

"We'll get a cake from Wal-Mart for them with both their names on it," Lyons
said chuckling. "We're friends 'til the end."

Both showed up together Monday at the Georgia International Convention Center in
College Park, hoping to find jobs and put an end to what's been an unsettling
period. They were among some 500 people who attended the Career and Benefits
Expo Monday, the first day of a two-day event aimed at laid-off airline and
hospitality workers like Dewlen and Lyons.

The two men's lives have been in upheaval since June, when they first were let
go from Northwest Airlines in Minneapolis. The pair moved their families to
metro Atlanta and got jobs with Northwest until shortly after the Sept. 11
attacks, when they were let go again. The pair received about eight weeks of
severance in exchange for forfeiting medical coverage and flying privileges.

It's a particularly harsh ending for Lyons, who had been with the airline 18
years, the last two as a mechanic.

"I tried to upgrade and became an aircraft mechanic," he said. That decision
cost him seniority and, in the end, his job.

The expo, hosted by the Georgia Department of Labor, is the "culmination of
three years of work," said state Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond. He has
been trying to transform the agency's image from "the old unemployment office,"
where people stood in line for hours, to a more businesslike approach,
punctuated by online filing and job search services.

The state agency normally holds job fairs and helps companies undergoing
layoffs, but the expo is different, Thurmond said. It is the first time laid-off
workers in targeted industries have a chance to sign up for first-time
unemployment benefits, interview with companies and get help with everything
from educational grants to medical coverage for their children --- all in one
spot. Dewlen and Lyons picked up applications for PeachCare, the state health
care program for children.

"We're hoping we can get medical coverage for the kids," said Dewlen, father of
three children, all of whom are under the age of 5. Lyons has two children.

With so many other airline workers hunting for jobs, they concede their chances
of finding work as aircraft mechanics are slim. They did, however, pick up
possible job leads for their wives. Dewlen's wife used to be a teacher. Lyons'
wife has a nursing background.

Brent and Grace Wells aren't in travel or hospitality, but the East Point couple
attended Monday's event anyway. Both are looking for work.

Brent is a welder with a background in warehouse work; Grace Wells lost her job
with an apartment leasing firm in July. She has 13 years of customer service
experience, a highly sought after skill by many employers at the expo. Both came
away encouraged.

"The opportunities with the jobs were overwhelming," Grace Wells said. "I wasn't
expecting so many."

Recruiters like Tammy Fair and Brenda Popp found the expo useful. Fair works for
staffing giant Randstad North America. Popp recruits for Emory Clinic. Popp was
looking for Delta workers with customer service backgrounds. Fair needs bill
collectors and business analysts. The sour economy means many companies,
including Randstad clients, are behind on their bills.

"I'm seeing a lot of people with 20 and 30 years of experience," Fair said. She
said many of the Delta workers she talked to are looking to change careers. "A
lot of them aren't leaving until the end of the year, or the first of the year,
or they have awesome [severance] packages," which cushions their job hunting,
she said.

That's the case for Mark VanderZouwen, a technical analyst who had been with
Delta Air Lines about 11 years. His last day was Halloween. He's got about 20
weeks of severance and a month of vacation pay.

He's not sure if he's eligible for unemployment compensation, but he arrived
early Monday morning to sign up anyway. By law, workers can't receive
unemployment until they've exhausted any compensation they get from their
employer, which includes severance and vacation pay.

"I don't know how long it'll take to find something in this market," he said.

WANT TO ATTEND?
Because of increased interest from workers outside the travel and hospitality
field, labor officials Monday decided to open the expo to any worker who's lost
a job as a result of the events of Sept. 11. The expo is open today from 8 a.m.
to 4 p.m at the Georgia International Convention Center, 1902 Sullivan Road,
College Park.

COMMUNITY;
Woman, 96, earns wings from Delta

HIGHLIGHT: Event was part of effort from four organizations.


Clem Ferguson nurtured a dream to be a flight attendant.

It's a dream she kept largely to herself growing up outside of Athens.

"I grew up in the country," said Ferguson. "I thought it would be glamorous to
travel as a flight attendant."

Life, however, led her to Berry College in Rome, where she studied home
economics.

She moved to Atlanta and worked at a company doing filing and mailing. She
traveled by car to places like Ohio and Florida, but never ventured outside the
United States.

Who says, though, that dreams can't eventually come true?

At 96, Ferguson, who lives in the Nursing and Rehab Center at Christian City in
Union City, earned her wings as an honorary Delta Air Lines flight attendant.
She won't be hitting the skies, but she is still flying high.

AbeamingFergusonwaspinned Tuesday during a special event at the center.

This all came about through a joint effort by PruittHealth, Christian City,
Delta and Second Wind Dreams, which grants wishes for senior citizens.

"We believe that our elders still have hopes and dreams," said P.K. Beville,
founder of Second Wind Dreams. "We live in a culture in which everybody believes
that children are our future, but, in fact, the elderly are our future. That's
where we're all headed -- where they are now. We need to focus on making their
lives happy and joy-filled."

At first, Ferguson said no when she was told about her wish being granted and
that she would go to the in-flight training center. She was worried about her
physical condition.

Ferguson, a widow, must use a wheelchair after a fall a few years ago.

It took Irene Ngonga, a nurse assistant, to persuade her to go.

"She is absolutely elated about her dream coming true and absolutely exhausted
from the dream that seemingly never ends," said Steven Sheets, administrator of
the Nursing and Rehab Center.

Now that she has achieved one milestone, what is next on her wish list?

It's pretty simple. Ferguson dreams of seeing a sister, Betty Culbertson, 83,
who is in an assisted living facility in Birmingham, Ala. She said it's been
about a year since the two last saw each other.

"She used to come see me, but now she's not able," she said.

Sheets said when he asked Ferguson about her visiting her sister, the honorary
flight attendant, thinking it was another hoopla-surrounded dream event, wagged
her finger and said, "Steve, I am not going to Birmingham."

LENGTH: 1204  words


I am giving you a copy of the introductory page from the Veterans Affairs
announcement of a new dental insurance program for veterans enrolled in the VA
healthcare system and the VA's Civilian Health and Medical Program. The premiums
start at $9.73/month, but there are other levels of coverage for higher monthly
rates. Please check it out at www.va.gov/healthbenefits or call

We value the service you have provided to our country and now we have an
opportunity to serve you. For the first time in history, the U.S. government has
authorized a national dental insurance program for Veterans enrolled in VA
healthcare and individuals enrolled in VA's Civilian Health and Medical Program

provides the best value and best service available.

Delta Dental's Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Program (VADIP) offers
enrollment in the new program beginning November 15, 2013 with coverage starting

plans offered under Delta Dental: Standard, Enhanced and Comprehensive. You will
also find how to verify if you are eligible for the program, cost by plan, a
description of the service area that provides you broad access to care, the
advantages of selecting an in-network dentist and, most importantly, how to
enroll in VADIP.

Branstad Completes Work on FY 2015

Governor Terry Branstad completed action on the FY 2015 state budget last week,
taking action on all of the proposed budget bills. While the number of item
vetoes was lower than what has been experienced in recent years, the impact of
the budget was still significant.

Receiving the most attention from the media was the Governor's decision to veto
the Debt Reduction and Strategic Investments bill, Senate File 2363. This bill
proposed the early retirement of the Vision Iowa Bonds, while appropriating
funds for a number of projects including the completion of current Board of
Regents infrastructure projects and further investments in the state's water
quality initiative. In his veto message, the Governor stated that even though he
supported many of the projects in the bill he was unable to approve it do to the
significant drop in state revenue in May.

The Governor's decision to veto SF 2363 forced action on two other bills. Major
revisions were made to the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund appropriations bill
(SF 2349). Because the Governor vetoed funding the final year of the Regents
projects through SF 2363, the existing RIIF appropriation had to remain. This
caused a number of new line items to be cut, including an additional $10 million
for major maintenance of state-owned facilities, $4 million for routine
maintenance, $4 million increase in REAP funding, and the first year of funding
for new infrastructure projects at the three state universities.

Vetoing the payoff of the Vision Iowa Bonds meant that $15 million expected to
be freed up in RIIF would still have to be used for payments to bondholders.
This shortfall meant that there were not sufficient funds to use RIIF to pay for
computer and IT projects covered through the Technology Reinvestment Fund.
Because of this, the Governor vetoed language in the Standings bill (HF 2473)
notwithstanding the use of $17.5 million from the General Fund for these
technology initiatives.

The Governor also chose to veto language in the Standings bill that would have
required state agencies to provide the Legislature with an annual report on
federal grants and funds received in the previous federal fiscal year. Such
information would have been extremely helpful to budget subcommittees in
performing the necessary oversight of state-run programs that often get missed
in the appropriations process. Also taken out of the Standings bill was changing
how the state pays off claims against the state. This unpredictable cost is
currently funded as a standing General Fund appropriation, but would have moved
to the Economic Emergency Fund just like the state's share of natural disaster
costs. Governor Branstad also took out portions of three other budget bills.
Language in the Justice Systems budget bill restricting the potential
privatizing of correction functions was struck as was language in the Ag &
Natural Resources bill that would have allowed DNR to use the Fish and Game Fund
to pay for salary adjustments. As always, the Health and Human Services budget
bill saw a number of item vetoes including language complying with federal
requirements for asset verification of those applying for Medicaid.

Earlier in the week, the Governor made a number of revisions in the Economic
Development bill related to the implementation of the apprenticeship program.
Four budget bills were signed by the Governor without any changes. These bills
were Administration & Regulation (SF 2342), Education (SF 2347), Judicial Branch
(HF 2449), and Transportation (SF 2130). With the Governor's action, the state
will now spend $6.9794 billion in FY 2014.

DNR Announces Derelict Building Program Awards Grants

On Thursday, May 22, 2014, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued
a press release in which the DNR announced that the Derelict Building Grant
Program (DBGP) will award grants to 20 small, rural Iowa communities to help
deconstruct or renovate abandoned structures and limit construction and
demolition materials going to the landfill. The DNR Derelict Building Grant
Program was instituted in 2011 (Senate File 509, section 24) to help rural
communities with populations of 5,000 or less. DBGP funding is awarded annually
on a competitive basis with cash matches required. The program is funded with
$400,000 of the state Ground Water Protection fund that comes from a portion of
state collected solid waste tipping fees. Applications for the next funding
round will be due in spring 2015. The idea for this program was first introduced
by a House Republican amendment in 2007 to that year's IDALS, DNR, & EFF budget
bill (H 1836D to HF 5512007) that was opposed at that time by House Democrats
who were in control of the state legislature at that time. Twenty projects
around the state will receive a total of $630,900.00 as reimbursement grants
with two of the projects receiving grants in Sioux County: City of Hawarden --
$21,000 to continue the renovation at the old city hall building in an effort to
establish a public meeting space and military museum.

City of Hull -- $21,000 to partner with the Hull Industrial Development
Corporation to deconstruct the abandoned creamery building. The building site
will be sold to a commercial entity interested in developing a retail lot.

Foundation reaches Oklahomans through low-income care, empowering message

BYLINE: By Melissa Howell Staff Writer

SECTION: SPEX11; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 514 words


Recent studies have found that poor oral health has been linked to heart
disease, stroke, infection, diabetes, low birth weight and premature
birth.Despite the health risks, 42 percent of Americans and almost 50 percent of
Oklahomans have no dental insurance and can't afford steep out-of-pocket
expenses.Delta Dental of Oklahoma Oral Health Foundation is looking to change
that through outreach programs designed to address a critical deficit in access
to dental care and provide early oral health education in Oklahoma. In all, the
foundation has donated in excess of $16 million since 1998 to reach Oklahomans
with dental needs and spread a message on the importance of oral health, said
Terrisa Singleton, director of the Delta Dental of Oklahoma Oral Health
Foundation."Delta Dental of Oklahoma is a not-for-profit 501(c)(4), so we're
committed to public benefit and not committed to stockholders," she said.
"That's why the foundation chooses to donate so much - because it is part of
their mission.

We believe slightly over half of Oklahomans have dental benefits through their
companies. The foundation truly is there to reach out to that other half."This
is achieved primarily through grants to clinics that provide services to
low-income patients, and partnerships with Oklahoma Dental Foundation and
Oklahoma Dental Association to provide free care to those who can't afford it or
bring services to locations that lack adequate dental facilities.&nbsp;In
addition to these programs, the foundation provides education to kindergarten
through third-grade students with its Captain Supertooth initiative.A free
service to Oklahoma schools, Captain Supertooth, a costume-clad dental crusader,
visits classrooms throughout Oklahoma teaching children about the lifelong
benefits of good oral health."This program has been with us since 2000,"
Singleton said. "Our goal is basically to get some oral health education into
public schools. This is empowering kids to take responsibility for their oral
health."During his visits, Captain Supertooth gives a 20- to 25-minute
presentation that is interactive and fun for the students.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Currently, the program serves about 20,000 students per year totaling more
than 225,000 since its inception. In the near future, Singleton said the
foundation will be about to reach more children because of increased
funding."Right now, we're concentrated on getting to as many schools as
possible," she said. "But we're in the process of ramping that up."Although
Captain Supertooth is not an outcome-based program, Singleton said she is
keeping a close eye on the Third Grade Oral Health assessment that will be
released later this year by the Oklahoma Department of Health. Depending on the
findings, the report could indicate to what extent children are heeding the
foundation's message of personal responsibility for oral health.In a nutshell,
our mission is to improve the oral health of all Oklahomans through whatever
means that requires," Singleton said. "Our success is in how many kids receive
this positive and empowering message."

Clayton faculty credited for grants

BYLINE: GARY HENDRICKS

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Clayton / Henry Extra; Pg. 1JI

LENGTH: 603 words


Winning two of the largest federal grants in the history of Clayton College &
State University was not the work of a lone bureaucrat cloistered with a laptop
in a back office writing the proposals.

Instead, school officials credit a faculty with hands-on experience and varied
backgrounds for being able to compete successfully with larger universities and
foundations for grants totaling nearly $1.6 million.

"We have such a diverse faculty," CCSU President Tom Harden said. "Each member
brings certain skills and ideas to the process."

But Harden said the school has no organized program for writing grant
applications, although acquiring a staffer for that purpose is a priority.

"The writers (faculty members) step up and offer their services," Harden said.

According to CCSU spokesman John Shiffert, the new grants, $927,000 for training
former military personnel for civilian jobs and $650,000 to encourage minorities
to go into nursing, exceed the total of all grants the school received last year
--- $1.2 million.

"I think we got (both grants) with innovative approaches that have never before
been tried," said Wallace Shakun, dean of continuing education at CCSU.

Shakun, a former member of the military, helped formulate the military grant
proposal.

The military grant is aimed at Army, Navy and Air Force personnel --- sergeants
and lower --- nearing the end of their enlistments. It is designed to identify
job openings in the private sector and then match military personnel to them
before their enlistments are completed, according to Ed Sherwood, director of
corporate training and economic development for the school and one of the
authors of the proposal.

"This has never been done before and is probably the reason we won the grant,"
Sherwood said.

Through the program, the school will provide what amounts to correspondence
courses via the Internet or compact-disc programs to the military personnel on
their bases. They are identified as job candidates by the military transition
offices at every base, Sherwood said.

The courses hone reading, writing and math skills to prepare the military
personnel for corporate training in the private sector. Among the corporate
partners are CSX railroad, Delta Air Lines and the Georgia Motor Transport
Association, Sherwood said.

The nursing grant's unique approach, which also probably helped CCSU win over
nursing schools across the nation, is that it targets middle-school students,
said program coordinator Dr. Astrid Wilson.

Under the program, CCSU will go to two Clayton middle schools, Kendrick and
Mundy's Mill, and seek minority students who may be interested in nursing
careers. Then, the candidates are tracked from that point through their
health-care training to determine if they successfully completed their education
and entered the profession, Wilson said.

Another aspect of the nursing program is to aid CCSU students already on campus
and encourage them to enter nursing, Wilson said.

"At CCSU, we're looking at students with English as a second language," Wilson
said. "They feel they are isolated, because their accents are difficult to
understand."

Such students tend to avoid courses where comprehension of the content is
difficult because of the language barrier. The grant, designed to increase
diversity in the nursing profession, will help those students with the necessary
language skills, Wilson said.

The grant writers credited the school with allowing them the time to work on
proposals.

"Without the support of the leadership, we couldn't do it," Sherwood said.

TELEHEALTH: Technology curbs employee costs, improves efficiency

BYLINE: Kathleen Koster

SECTION: HEALTH CARE; Pg. 17 Vol. 26 No. 2

LENGTH: 1730  words


It may seem like science fiction, but telehealth technology is making real-life
strides in curbing consumer health care costs while ensuring convenience and
efficiency for patients.

According to the Department of Labor, companies lose approximately 2.8 million
workdays a year due to employee injuries and illnesses. Experts hope that the
recent implementation of telehealth technology into workplace settings will
lower the number of unnecessary sick days or unproductive workdays.

Telemedicine, the precursor for telehealth, has been around for about 20 years
and is a technology concept that typically helps connect rural hospitals and
centers in areas that lack resources and staff with physicians and medical
experts. Telemedicine still exists today to foster communication between health
centers.

In the last couple years, partly because the technology had improved and
patients were better educated about technology, the industry has seen the
development of online care. This system uses telemedicine technology to give
consumers, instead of medical providers, access to physician help in any
setting, including their homes or workplaces.

"Acquisition of health care services through technology is now initiated or is
acquired by the patient in the patient's own setting. You're creating pipes
between wherever the physician or provider is and wherever the patient is. That
changes the landscape of who is available for care delivery in a pretty
remarkable fashion," says Roy Schoenberg, CEO of American Well.

In areas that have been deprived of health care, government subsidies
traditionally sent a rotating door of physicians to work a few years in
difficult-to-reach, often rural, areas.

Now, explains Schoenberg, "all of these different programs are fusing toward
investing in telehealth, because you can completely equalize access to health
care for patients who don't live in [large cities] ... It is so important that
it's not only [about] the efficiency of health care delivery, it also has a
social impact."

By implementing online care, which includes webcam technology seen through a Web
browser, as well as audio and secure text chat, "you can tap into that network
of services from your home," he adds.

The process makes the health care delivery system more efficient by enabling
patients to acquire actual health care services over the Internet. They don't
need to schedule a future appointment because delivery can be instantaneous. By
logging on, patients can connect with the appropriate type of service provider
at any time of day or night.

A lot of health care can effectively be delivered, especially when physicians
rely more on discussion and questioning, labs and imaging than on the physical
inspection of patients.

Headaches, strep throat, diarrhea, or rashes are issues that can be treated with
telehealth, but are typically things that would keep employees out of work. With
the cough and cold season upon us, physicians can use medical judgment to
determine whether questions about coughs, upper respiratory infections, pink eye
or the like require in-person attention. Also, if sickness strikes at 2 a.m.
when only the ER is open, telehealth portals provide inexpensive and immediate
access.

This is important because patients can get care while they're motivated to do
something about it. This could save lives when one considers how significant
catching a health issue early can be.

Further, telehealth technology provides access for chronic patients with limited
mobility. Homebound patients often have to see many health professionals with
high frequency. They need the most care, and they consume most of the health
care dollars, so making care delivery efficient and easy for them to stay on top
of treatment is a gigantic step in the right direction. Chronic patients with
diabetes, asthma or a heart condition can do follow-ups with their physicians
and get guidance on therapy and diet.

"[Telehealth] literally takes the health care system, packages it and delivers
it as needed to the hands of employees [wherever they are] ... It's a much
broader application than just creating a Web chat with a physician in a far away
location," Schoenberg says.

Recently, there has been tremendous progress with large employers helping their
employees focus on work by providing easy access to physicians for employees and
dependents. The most straightforward way to do this for a geographically
dispersed workforce is to implement a telehealth program in large companies with
many campuses.

Many benefit integrators and brokers are acquiring these systems for all
employers they handle, bringing these services to small- and midsized employer
clients.

Telehealth takes hold

"There's been a lot of advancement from a technology perspective over the last
couple years ... both the quality [increase] and the cost being driven down has
made this a more feasible alternative," explains Peter Hotz, Walgreens group
vice president.

"Patient engagement can drive long-term lifestyle and behavior changes, and
really drive improvements in health status ... We worked with Cisco to determine
how we can use technology to expand the reach of an worksite health center into
the reach of a smaller population," Hotz adds. "As the technology improves and
becomes more affordable, and people become more accepting of electronic means of
interface, it takes the elements of face-to-face engagement, but does it in a
way that allows us to reach a much broader population."

Walgreens started a pharmacy in Cisco's main San Jose, Calif., site two years
ago and took over remote care for remote sites about four months ago. The
company has a full primary medical center model in the main campus, and its
North Carolina satellite office has a nurse to do hands-on help as well as
facilitate contact with a physician in California.

The LifeConnections Health Center in San Jose serves approximately 12,600
individual patients, or 47% of Cisco's employee population and 20% of its San
Jose dependent population, through approximately 23,000 visits annually. The
LifeConnections Clinic in North Carolina serves approximately 480 individual
patients, or about 10% of the employee population.

Cisco has reduced costs in medical claims, saved in productivity and increased
employee engagement in health coaching and condition management. Based on recent
data, the patient-centered medical home in San Jose, where they use Cisco health
technology solutions, may reduce medical claims costs by up to 14%.

Schoenberg estimates that a telehealth station costs one one-hundredth the cost
of hiring a nurse for a year at an onsite clinic. The beauty of telehealth is
that an employer is able to utilize the same medical staff from their
headquarters' clinic in satellite offices.

In addition to accessibility in remote campuses, the system will allow employees
access from their homes in case they have issues outside of work hours. These
efficiencies allow employers to expand their clinic services because if they
decide to add a physician to the onsite clinic, for example, a telehealth
program means they don't need to add an additional physician at every campus;
one can serve them all. Other examples to expanding health care offerings
include adding a physician, a nutritionist, or a health specialist for employees
who suffer from severe stress or sleeping disorders.

OptumHealth launched its NowClinic in 2010 with Delta Airlines. "We wanted to
develop a solution that was giving people fast and convenient access to doctors
wherever and whenever they need care," explains Karen Silgen, OptumHealth's
senior director of product development.

By collaborating with American Well, the NowClinic has spread to clients and all
consumers in the 18 states in which NowClinic is live (as of presstime) and is
available to 150 million Americans in these states. Further, OptumHealth has
launched with over 35 different employers across the United States.

Delta Airlines has onsite clinics with computers in satellite offices, and any
computer connected to the Internet can use NowClinic for those traveling or
teleworking, or during off-hours.

In the first phase of implementing the NowClinic Telehealth initiative, Delta
Airlines communicated with mailers and emails to employees in different
locations that it would soon be rolled out to build awareness. In the second
phase, the airline brought people onsite for health fairs and sign-up events to
generate enthusiasm. In the third phase, word of mouth took over. People loved
the convenience, low cost and efficiency of the program, and were quick to
recommend it to their colleagues.

"The employees have been enthusiastic about the NowClinic program and concept
because they immediately get it. It's increasing access to care without taking
away the care they have today at the same cost they always have, but now they
have much easier ways to access a physician, particularly in evenings, weekends
and when they're away from their normal setting," explains Lynn Zonakis,
managing director of health and strategy resources at Delta Airlines.

"We're noticing that employees are using NowClinic online care as opposed to
going to an urgent care center for minor ailments [for which] they may not need
an in-person exam," Silgen says. "It's a big time-saver for productivity and
helps support the employer as well as the employee."

Cost varies

Cost and implementation details vary by organization. Employers should consider
whether they want to set up the program themselves or subscribe to services
their health plan provides. Large employers often run their own telehealth
program to cater to their employee base.

They also must determine which services they want to deliver. Which medical
professionals will work with the community - nurses, physicians and/or
specialists? Will it be available 24/7 or just certain days? In general, the
cost is not about infrastructure, it centers on paying for physicians.

"I see this being an important part of many employers' benefit plan design. As
they start to think about how to increase the total population health, this is
one component of it," Silgen says.

Right now, employees can connect with a physician or nurse; soon it will expand
to wellness coaches, for example.

"In the long run, about 10 years [from now], this truly is going to
revolutionize how people are able to connect with care providers," says Silgen.

How do you create a small gold mining company? Start with a middle-sized one and
make a controversial acquisition, goes the joke about Delta Gold Ltd. Delta's
share price has had a horror run (see graph) on the combined effects of the
lacklustre gold price and the scrip takeover of Ross Mining NL, which has now
closed well above the 90 per cent level. The Delta price yesterday sank 4Â¢ to
an historic low of $1.38. There is nothing much wrong with Delta's operations
but the Guadalcanal address of its Gold Ridge mine has had nervous investors in
a spin. Although the mine is still operating, unease between Guadalcanal locals
and their Malaitan neighbours produced a roadblock last week between the mine
site and Honiara, the capital 30 kilometres away. Delta CEO Terry Burgess
reported late last week that road travel had subsequently recommenced, with a
helicopter shuttle used while the road was cut. Market pundits say a bigger
worry for Delta is possible removal from the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Index on market capitalisation grounds, a near-certainty now for
Resolute Resources and likely for Email Ltd, and Colonial Ltd post the CBA
takeover. Likely additions are Woodside, Computershare Ltd and MYOB Ltd.

Score one for Credit Suisse Funds Management. Sally Warneford, lately health
care analyst at Merrill Lynch, will be starting there in June to work on the buy
side. We understand that the CS business used to be primarily fixed interest but
now has more than $13 billion under management, including $4.1 billion worth of
Australian equities. Warneford joins chief investment officer Tim Ryan, Craig
McCourtie, Richard Kornman, Andrew Spence, John Lobb, Dusko Bajic and Russell
Bye.

Has private client stockbroking got any easier since the end of the tech boom?
The jury's still out, with the wise heads merely noting there's not much future
for dud advice at the full-service end of the business. Thank you. One approach
that has apparently been months in the planning is Grant Patterson and Steve
Dammerer's Providence Wealth Advisory Group. This enterprise is planning to open
its doors on July 1, which means they at least know where they are with GST.
Both men worked together at BZW before going their separate ways. Patterson left
his job as head of retail at BZW's successor, ABN Amro, about six months ago,
while Dammerer has been working as treasurer of Citibank in New Zealand.

It used to be known as DGN, but now DNA might be a better name. Duketon
Goldfields, which has textile millionaire Fred Bart as its chairman and major
shareholder, plans to unlock the secrets contained within the human body. The
Bart-controlled company stresses it is not another cash-strapped junior seeking
to hitch its fortunes to an embryonic technology play. With $10 million in cash
and near liquids, money is not the issue just how to turn the $10 million into a
$100 million is. This week it acquired 10 per cent of GeneType, a group which
has made significant discoveries in the field of advanced genetics during the
past 10 years. The details and potential applications are too technical to go
into here but among other things disputed paternity cases should prove easier to
solve. Genetype founder, Melbourne-based Dr Mervyn Jacobson, joined the board of
the former gold explorer and is expected to replace Bart as the company's major
shareholder following the placement of further shares to GeneType.

This column maligned Sir Ron Brierley yesterday by reporting that his Industrial
Equity Group bought David Jones shortly before selling it to John Spalvins'
Adsteam group in 1990. A reader with a clearer memory of the 1980s points out
that IEL never owned David Jones but in fact it was Adsteam, David Jones and
Tooth which acquired IEL via the joint venture vehicle Dextran. DJs was part of
the Adsteam group from the early 80s onwards. Not that the mix-up should affect
Brierley's knowledge of DJs, which Street Talk believes is firmly in his sights.
His files on the Adsteam group, including DJs, were a legend in thoroughness.
Back in the market, DJs shares climbed 3Â¢ to $1.14 on solid turnover but
Lonsdale Securities' mystery undisclosed bidder at $1.10 failed to score.

Louisiana hospital will use 'health coaches' to reduce readmissions

BYLINE: Jessica Gonzalez

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 712  words


For the past two years since the approval of the Affordable Care Act, reducing
readmission rates has increasingly become a matter of fiscal fitness for
hospitals.

The federal government's new standards are in lockstep with a health insurance
industry shift to base hospital payouts on the quality of their treatment rather
than quantity of patients that come through their doors. The incentive to
hospitals is to keep patients -- especially those with costly chronic illnesses
-- out of the revolving door, and they are attempting to do so with better
coordination of efforts across different departments.

One area hospital is exploring ways of providing a continuum of care while also
minimizing expenses.

North Oaks Medical Center, a 350-licensed bed health network in Hammond, is
developing a partnership with Southeastern Louisiana University. It will involve
hiring students as interns to work with patients once they are discharged.

Hospital administrators spearheading the program say it's a cost- effective way
to remain engaged with chronically ill patients after they leave the hospital,
and it provides students with valuable workforce experience.

"Until the last five to 10 years, there has not been a significant role for
helping patients manage disease (in hospitals]," said Shelly Welch, North Oaks
senior vice president of patient services. "Historically, its (care
coordination] has happened more with primary care... We don't have that resource
to go into their home and work with them. It's not service covered by insurance,
so we started looking creatively at what we can do. "

Officially named the Louisiana Delta Health Coach Program, it is set to begin
this fall. Money for the program comes from a three-year, $351,989 grant given
to Southeastern Louisiana University by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Ann Carruth, dean of SLU's College of Nursing and Health Sciences and principal
investigator for the grant, explained that the role of a health coach is
currently evolving as a result of federal health care law changes, and she
expects growing workforce demand for graduates with this experience.

"Health coaches have been around in various capacities for some time ... but I
think historically they've been thought of more along the lines of personal
trainers, people keeping you motivated to be healthy," Carruth said. "We're
working with chronically ill individuals discharged from the hospital who have
very specific needs, and identify the barriers they face to getting their
prescriptions and follow- up care. "

The idea, she added, is to get them the treatment they need to manage their
illness and stay out of the hospital.

North Oaks' student coaches will come from a variety of educational backgrounds,
including social work, health education, nursing, and pre-medicine. They will
follow up with chronically ill patients to see if they are following their
physicians' instructions, taking required medications, following a prescribed
diet, using appropriate therapies and scheduling follow-up visits.

When the grant expires in three years, Carruth and Welch say they will seek
additional grant funding.

Whether more hospitals will add health coaches to their payrolls in the future
depends on the pay-for-performance shift, said Walter "Dub" Lane, health care
economist and board member of Slidell Memorial Hospital.

"They (hospitals] know where they want to be in future, but there has to be
incentives for institutions to provide these services," Lane said. "At this
point, very few people are in these programs and are kind of doing that
(coordinated care efforts] as an experimental project. It's costing them
money... When we get there, then these care coordinators can benefit the
hospital financially, and there are health benefits for patients. "

The Affordable Care Act's hospital readmissions reduction program ties Medicare
reimbursements to the number of patients returning for treatment of the same
illness. As of October, the maximum readmissions reduction penalty was 2 percent
of total Medicaid reimbursements. Depending on the facility, that can translate
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Washington: In Eastern Kentucky, USDA Launches Relending Program to Reduce Rural
Poverty Nationwide

LENGTH: 867  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



 Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today unveiled an innovative partnership with
community development organizations from across the country, providing $401
million of Community Facilities program funds to recipients with a track record
of successful programs to help reduce poverty in some of the nation's poorest
and most isolated rural communities. Twenty-six community development
organizations have been approved to draw upon the funding to provide long-term,
low-interest financing to be "re-lent" to local entities to build, acquire,
maintain or renovate essential community facilities. The funds also can be used
for capacity building and to finance essential community services, such as
education, health care and infrastructure.





 Many of the projects will be in some of the nation's poorest rural areas, such
as communities in Appalachia, the colonias along the U.S./Mexico border, and in
the Mississippi Delta region. Long-term poverty disproportionately affects rural
areas. Nearly nine out of 10 counties where 20 percent or more of the population
has lived in poverty for 30 years or more are rural.



 "This effort builds on our commitment to lifting up the economic prospects of
communities that have not benefited from the revitalization of rural America,"
Vilsack said. "By engaging with local and national partners, private-sector
financial institutions and philanthropic organizations, USDA will inject a
game-changing level of investment capital to reduce poverty in targeted rural
areas where the capacity for growth has not been realized. As we have seen with
the Obama Administration's Promise Zone initiative and USDA's StrikeForce
effort, targeted, place-based investments can have a real impact on reducing
poverty. This funding adds another important tool in that fight."



 The financing has two unique features. First, private financial institutions,
including Bank of America and others, will be providing guarantees for a portion
of the loans. Second, the recipient community development organizations, or
"re-lenders," may also have an opportunity to secure grants provided by seven of
the nation's premier philanthropic organizations through a $22 million fund to
assist in managing and capacity building. The Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation
will manage this grant fund.



 Vilsack made the announcement at Berea College, which has received USDA funding
to help businesses become more energy efficient. Earlier this year, the town of
Berea received a $10 million Community Facilities loan to renovate and expand
the city hall and public safety facilities.



 The town of Berea has played an integral role in USDA's place-based
initiatives. Last year, it was chosen as one of 10 pilot sites for the Rural
Integration Models for Parents and Children to Thrive (Rural IMPACT)
demonstration project. Rural IMPACT helps communities adopt a two-generation
approach to addressing the needs of vulnerable children and their parents. Its
goal is to increase parents' employment and education and improve the health and
well-being of families.



 The project is led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in
collaboration with USDA, the Department of Labor, the Corporation for National
and Community Service, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional
Authority, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and other
philanthropic partners. The members of this public/private partnership have
selected 10 local and tribal communities and placed AmeriCorps VISTA members
there to provide technical assistance and capacity-building resources to reduce
child poverty. At a White House Rural Forum convened in State College, Pa.,
earlier this week, the partners announced that the AmeriCorps VISTA members will
remain in the 10 communities for a second year.



 USDA expects the financing announced today will serve as a catalyst for
additional investment. Many of the community developers already have established
relationships with other private and philanthropic funders. The ability to
relend money could foster greater leveraging of private and philanthropic
investments in rural communities.



 USDA Rural Development has a $215 billion loan portfolio and offices in every
state in the nation. The agency annually invests $30 billion, on average, in
rural communities.



 Since 2009, USDA Rural Development (@USDARDThis is an external link or
third-party site outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website.) has funded nearly 9,200 community facilities such as schools, public
safety and health care facilities; invested nearly $13 billion to start or
expand nearly 112,000 rural businesses; helped 1.1 million rural residents buy
homes; and helped bring high-speed Internet access to nearly 6 million rural
residents and businesses. USDA also has invested $31.3 billion in 963 electric
projects that have financed more than 185,000 miles of transmission and
distribution lines serving 4.6 million rural residents.

SECTION: EXTRA; Section I; Page 3

LENGTH: 451 words


The Henry Arts Alliance is launching a new community chorus, and any adult male
or female singer is welcome to join without an audition.

Ed Bridges, founder of the arts alliance, said previous singing experience with
a high school, college or church chorus would be helpful but is not required.

A group of 50 to 60 singers is the goal, according to Bridges, who will be
director of the chorus.

Rehearsals will be once a week from 7:30-9 p.m. at a local church.

For information, call Bridges at 914-8581 or 946-9362.

New chancellor to speak. Stephen R. Portch, the recently appointed chancellor of
the University System of Georgia, will be featured speaker at Clayton State
College's 24th annual graduation ceremony June 11. About 500 seniors are
expected to be awarded degrees at the ceremony. Portch will take office as
administrator of the 34-unit University System on July 1.

Two banks plan to merge. The Etowah Bank of Canton and Riverdale- based Peach
State Bank have announced plans to merge into a single commercial banking
institution. The new bank will have $ 275 million in total assets and 14

bidder but was selected, according to company officials, because of its ability
to provide the most productive combination of machine, controls and material
handling ability.

Hearings providing simple solutions to health care

BYLINE: Bernice Trick, The Citizen

SECTION: SECOND FRONT; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 471  words


Val Roddick says she hears some simple solutions to health care that really
catch the attention as she travels the province to hold public hearings.

Roddick, chair of the B.C. government's Select Standing Committee on Health,
says a farmer in Courtenay has suggested major hospitals provide parking places
for out-of-town people with campers and RVs so they can stay without it costing
so much money.

``It's so simple,'' Roddick (Liberal MLA, South Delta) said, ``but could make
such a difference to those needing care away from home.''

The nine-member committee of MLAs, during a public hearing in Prince George
Tuesday had 16 ``witnesses'' on the presenters list. First up was Northern
Interior Regional Health Board, which emphasized the need for a ``strong Prince
George Regional Hospital''.

Health board chair Lorraine Grant told the committee insufficient funding and
cutbacks on hospital services have made it impossible for PGRH to fully realize
its potential as a regional referral centre serving the 136,000 people of the
North.

Grant told how the $10 million contract for recruiting doctors has resulted in
17 physicians coming to Prince George, and how $1 million for recruiting and
retaining other health professionals paid for a refresher nursing course at CNC,
resulting in 18 new nurses. Grant told The Citizen her hope is that the
government will support ``initiatives we have started, especially like the
additional money for recruitment and retention.''

Lorna Dittmar, who operates a private supported living home for seniors,
suggested the government make use of the home to save health care costs by
subsidizing those who cannot afford the home.

Dittmar pointed out the cost of seniors living in hospitals costs about $1,000 a
day, those in senior residents cost about $125 a day while her residents pay $50
a day .

``But many cannot afford the $50 a day without a subsidy,'' she said.

Donald Manson, a long-time advocate of rural health care, said, since the
nursing shortages is a big part of the problem, the government needs to
implement a ``laddering'' system to provide education credits to Licenced
Practical Nurses wishing to become RNs and to RNs who want to become nursing
practitioners.

``There needs to be some co-operation within the nursing profession,'' said
Manson, who also recommends that medical graduates get some relief on student
loans for working in rural areas.

Other afternoon presenters had suggestions on improving aboriginal health care,
hospice care, physiotherapy and more.

The committee will hold meetings in Kamloops, Kelowna and Kimberley, and receive
written submissions by mid-November.

Roddick said the committee is seeking answers to what health services should be
covered, financed and delivered.

``Those three questions are the nuts and bolts of the future of health care in
B.C.''

Delta set to unveil African initiative

Delta Air Lines Inc. said it will make an announcement today regarding a
''strategic initiative'' in Africa. The Atlanta-based airline declined to give
details. Airlines worldwide are forming alliances to increase revenue and cut
costs without having to merge. Delta recently teamed with Air France SA and
AeroMexico and may be announcing an African partner, analysts said. ''The
alliances need to cover every area of the world,'' said David Treitel, chairman
and chief executive of Simat Helliesen & Eichner Inc., a New York- based
aviation consulting firm. ''There should be an interest'' in Africa.


GEORGIA: NewCare Health to sell 22 nursing homes
A federal bankruptcy judge has cleared the way for the sale of 22 nursing homes
owned by an Atlanta-based chain to a Nevada firm. The homes currently owned by
NewCare Health Corp. are in Georgia, Florida, Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee
and Kansas. The judge approved a $ 12.5 million bid by LTC Healthcare after
disqualifying a Pittsfield, Mass., company currently managing the homes. The
judge said the Pittsfield company, Lenox Health Care, had insider information.

AGL expects $ 35 million in pretax gains in quarter
AGL Resources Inc. expects to record pretax gains of $ 35 million for the fourth
quarter ending Sept. 30. The company said it completed its sale of Sonat Power
Marketing LP for $ 25 million and will take a $ 20 million gain on the sale.
Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes. The company
will record a $ 15 million gain on the sale of its interest in Sonat Marketing
Co., which closed in August. A First Call survey produced earnings estimates of
6 cents a share for the fourth quarter and 88 cents a share for the year. In the
fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, 1998, the company had net income of $ 11 million,
or 19 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $ 205.4 million.

Minute Maid to distribute through product broker
Minute Maid Co., responding to consolidation of supermarket chains across the
country, has formed a new national network for the marketing and sales of its
juice products. The company, based in Houston and owned by Coca-Cola Co. of
Atlanta, said Acosta Inc., a major consumer products broker, will represent it
in all 50 states for the supermarket, mass merchandise, drug and club store
businesses. The alliance represents a new trend in marketing and sales of
consumer products. Minute Maid is the first company to sign up with Acosta for
national sales.

Serologicals expands access to credit
Serologicals Corp. closed on a $ 75 million syndicated credit facility expiring
Sept. 28, 2002. The company said the credit facility amends a $ 35 million
revolving credit line that was scheduled to expire in October 2000. Serologicals
expects an initial draw of about $ 15 million, with the remaining credit
available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock
repurchases and other uses. Serologicals, of Clarkston, provides biological
materials and services to health care companies.

Mohawk authorizes stock-repurchase plan
Mohawk Industries Inc.'s board authorized a program to repurchase up to 5
million shares on the open market. The company said it will fund the program
under its existing revolving credit agreement. Mohawk said some of the
repurchased shares may be used for awards of stock and grants of stock options.
Calhoun-based Mohawk Industries, with 61.2 million shares outstanding,
manufactures woven and tufted broadloom carpet and rugs.


NATION: Factory orders rose 0.9% last month
Strong demand for cars and airplanes pushed up overall orders for big- ticket
manufactured goods in August, fresh evidence that manufacturers are still
gaining ground after a global financial crisis. Orders to factories for all
durable goods --- those expected to last at least three years --- unexpectedly
rose 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 206.9 billion, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday. August's performance --- the 12th increase
in 15 months --- was better than many analysts had expected. They were
forecasting orders would fall by 0.9 percent.

Treasury to sell more inflation-indexed bonds
The Treasury will sell $ 7 billion in 29 1/2-year inflation-indexed bonds next
Wednesday, raising new cash. The Treasury is offering an additional amount of
the 3 7/8 percent, 30-year inflation-indexed bond sold in April in an effort to
build an active market for the securities. The bonds will be dated April 15,
settle Oct. 15 and mature April 15, 2029. The CUSIP number, or identification,
will be 912810 FH 6.

WORLD: Net products maker Jacada planning IPO
Jacada Ltd., an Israel-based maker of products that help companies conduct
business over the Internet, said it plans to raise as much as $ 54 million
through an initial share sale in the United States. The company plans to sell
26.6 percent of the company, or 4.5 million shares, at $ 10 to $ 12 each. At the
high end of the pricing, the sale values Jacada at $ 203 million. Jacada intends
to use the proceeds for ''growing the company,'' including spending on sales and
marketing, said Gideon Hollander, chief executive and co-founder.  Jacada, with
headquarters and research and development facilities in Herzliya, Israel, and
offices in Atlanta and London, provides software and services for implementing
its software.

TECHNOLOGY: BellSouth creates online consulting unit
BellSouth has created a new, 75-person unit to offer consulting and online
technology to its business customers. The company aims to offer customers more
effective ways to get into their databases while they are providing service to
their own customers via the Internet, said Harry Stambaugh, assistant vice
president with the unit. For example, if a pizza restaurant sees that a caller
has not ordered a pizza for quite some time, software might suggest to the
person answering the phone that the customer be offered some kind of coupon,
Stambaugh said. The Customers Interaction Services unit, headed by Tony Floyd,
will be part of BellSouth Business.

Birmingham takes off with growth on land and in the air

BYLINE: By Alan Patureau STAFF WRITER

SECTION: DIXIE LIVING; Section M; Page 4

LENGTH: 1010 words


Birmingham, Ala. - It was a dark day in 1941 when Delta Air Lines picked Atlanta
over Birmingham for its main repair base and eventual passenger hub.

"Delta really wanted Birmingham because it was a more central location," recalls
local aviation pioneer Glenn Messer. "But [Atlanta Mayor William B.] Hartsfield
offered free land while Birmingham wanted them to pay through the nose. . . . If
we'd gotten Delta, this would be a different city, no question."

Author Paul Hemphill sees the treatment of Delta as "just one of several
wrong-headed decisions" that caused his hometown to lose in its rivalry with
Atlanta.

But one event beyond Birmingham's control has led to a new prosperity. The
glowing-red steel mills closed 20 years ago, sending leaders scrambling to find
replacement industries. Most jobs turned out to be white-collar.

"Now we're booming with health care, technology and research - you see clear
skies and a new energy in this town," says C. Mark Smith, director of
Birmingham's economic development office. Where U.S. Steel once was king, the
University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center is the top employer with
16,000 jobs.

Then last September, a bombshell announcement juiced the economy further.
Mercedes-Benz picked Alabama over Georgia and other Southern states as the place
to build a $ 300 million, 1,500-worker sports vehicle plant. It will rise at
Vance, Ala., 35 miles southwest of downtown Birmingham, prompting a spate of
parts and plastics industries.

So, is Birmingham back as a serious rival to Atlanta? Smith smiles. "It's not
lost on corporate decision-makers that medium-size cities like Birmingham can
offer more of the good life," he says. "In that sense we can compete with
Atlanta."

Success of the competition might surprise some. In recent years the U.S.
Conference of Mayors named Birmingham "America's Most Livable City," and
Newsweek magazine picked it one of the "10 Hot Cities."

Unexpected sights include a world-class Civil Rights Institute where a 1963
racist bombing took place; the dazzling, expanded Birmingham Museum of Art; the
Birmingham Race Course for thoroughbreds and greyhounds; breathtaking
restoration of the Sloss Furnaces where pig-iron was made; Riverchase Galleria
mall with the longest skylight in the Western Hemisphere; plus trendy
restaurants and shops in historic Five Points South. Sleek suburbs nestle
between mountains named Shades, Red and Oak, which rise like giant tidal waves
south of town.

As part of the Birmingham boom, the metropolitan population has slowly grown to
920,000 and should hit 1 million before the year 2000. Meantime, metro Atlanta
is nearing 3 million and continues to sprint ahead. (Compare this with 1950 when
Atlanta counted 331,000 residents, Birmingham 326,000.)

"You won't see the intense rivalry of yesteryear, it's more subtle," says Edward
LaMonte, former aide to Mayor Richard Arrington. He says Birmingham competes
with a pleasant lifestyle, unhurried traffic, leafy suburbs and a more "visual"
downtown than Atlanta, with whole blocks of restored buildings and greenery.

"Today's Birmingham accepts or rationalizes a secondary economic role to
Atlanta, and perceives advantages in not going the big-city route."

LaMonte says Birmingham's airport continued to suffer from mishandling for 40
years. But in 1981 city leaders confronted "the airport mess" - high fares, poor
service, inadequate facilities and corruption in the city aviation department.

Led by Arrington, they created an independent authority to run the airport,
canceled onerous aviation taxes, and negotiated deals with airlines to break the
Delta/Atlanta monopoly. "That kind of pragmatic vision was a breath of fresh air
in Birmingham," says LaMonte.

They landed Southwest Airlines in 1986, a cut-rate airline that attracts
customers from Atlanta for trips to New Orleans and points west.

With its reputation growing as a bargain flight mecca, Birmingham has 10
airlines and 97 flights a day, double the number of 1986. Atlanta counts 1,600
daily flights, but last year Atlanta disappeared from the list of top 10
destinations out of Birmingham.

Today's most popular flights are nonstops to Chicago, New Orleans and Houston.
For longer trips, passengers can fly to five hubs in addition to Atlanta on
Delta - Nashville and Dallas on American Airlines, Memphis on Northwest
Airlines, Charlotte on USAir and Cincinnati on ComAir.

Blessed - and limited - by its location only 4.5 miles east of downtown on I-20
and I-59, the municipal airport was carved from vegetable farms on the edge of
1931 Birmingham. Flights roar in over downtown, requiring a 35-story limit on
skyscrapers.

"The comfortable space for a large airport is no longer there; that's why
Alabama is considering a site 40 miles northeast near Gadsden for a true
international airport," says Messer.

One scenario even has Birmingham and Atlanta joining together - unthinkable in
the old rivalry days - to develop the Gadsden airport to take Atlanta's
overflow.

Loss of the air hub probably started the city's fade from the race with Atlanta.
But "the real turning point came in the early 1960s when Birmingham totally
mishandled desegregation," says Hemphill, an Atlanta resident who wrote the 1993
memoir, "Leaving Birmingham." "There's still a lot of old guilt involving police
dogs and water hoses and church bombings."

Hemphill believes the "unseemly racial ugliness" in his hometown had its roots
in the 1907 takeover of the locally owned steel industry by absentee barons of
U.S. Steel. "Birmingham became the ultimate company town," he says. "The local
power elite abdicated their dreams of creating a great dashing city. Never again
would they have the vested interest in their town that inspires men like Robert
Woodruff and Ivan Allen Jr. to do noble things for the common good."

Yet Hemphill adds, "Bull Connor is long gone. An enlightened black mayor
[Arrington] has run the city since 1979. Poor old Birmingham has paid for its
sins of the '60s. It deserves a break."

MISSISSIPPI CONSERVATION PROJECTS GAIN FARM BILL FUNDS, COCHRAN REPORTS

LENGTH: 539  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Senator Thad Cochran, U.S Government has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) today reported that two Mississippi-based
conservation projects have been singled out for more than $1.0 million in U.S.
Department of Agriculture grant funding, including a project to help socially
disadvantaged farmers adopt soil and water conservation technologies.

As authorized in the 2014 Farm bill, the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG)
are provided on a competitive basis to encourage the development and application
of new technologies that encourage improved conservation practices to address
natural resource concerns.  The 2014 CIG recipients were announced Monday by the
USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).

"The Conservation Innovation Grant program allows farmers to work voluntarily
with others to improve agriculture production while making changes that improve
soil health and water quality," said Cochran, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Agriculture Committee who played a pivotal role in crafting the 2014 farm
bill.

"I am pleased that projects with a focus on adopting innovative practices that
best fit Mississippi's needs are receiving this support from the USDA," he said.

For Mississippi, the Holmes County Food Hub in Durant was awarded a $640,775
grant to support a project titled "Introducing Innovative Conservation
Technologies to Assist Socially Disadvantaged Farmers in West and Central
Mississippi."  The goal of this project is to demonstrate to historically
underserved farm operations the agricultural sustainability and profitability
benefits of adopting conservation technologies, such as plasticulture and
subsurface irrigation.

A $438,750 grant has been approved for the Stoneville-based Delta F.A.R.M. (BF
Smith Foundation) for a project titled "Mississippi's Soil Health Initiative:
Fostering Awareness, Belief and Understanding through Local Experience and
Evaluation."  In an effort to promote wider use and acceptance of innovative
practices, the Delta F.A.R.M. project will demonstrate and field test soil
health systems on 12 farms and 2,400 acres.  It will compare the use of
traditional and innovative demonstrated soil health systems to evaluate soil and
water quality.

A separate $232,232 grant to Louisiana State University for soil health and
pasture ecosystem improvement would also have an impact on Mississippi. This
project seeks to demonstrate the benefits that multiple forage species forage
have on grazing pastures.

In all, the Mississippi CIG grants are among 47 awards worth $15.7 million that
were awarded nationwide by the USDA.

The NRCS determines CIG awards on a competitive basis to applicants that propose
new or improved conservation practices.  It is one of several conservation
projects involving working agriculture lands that were reformed in the 2014 farm
bill to improve cost-effectiveness and transparency.  In all, the farm bill
consolidated 23 conservation programs into 13 programs, saving $6.0 billion in
mandatory spending by streamlining programs and reducing program duplication in
taxpayer funding.

Republican Governors Say Budget Plan Cuts Too Deep

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER BURNS

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1511 words


Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky was unrestrained in his praise for President Trump:
Opening for him at a rally on Monday, Mr. Bevin, a conservative Republican,
echoed Mr. Trump's ''America First'' slogan and only gently noted the nagging
divisions in their party.

''We now have a president and a Congress that are united in party, and yet we
still have disagreements among us,'' Mr. Bevin said, insisting, ''This is
healthy and good.''

In private, Mr. Bevin has been blunter about the party's disagreements. Just
days before appearing with Mr. Trump in Louisville, he joined a conference call
with the president's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to protest a White House
proposal to defund the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development
agency that spans 13 states and steers millions of dollars in federal money to
Kentucky.

Mr. Bevin was not alone in his dismay.

As Mr. Trump and his advisers press for bone-deep cuts to the federal budget,
Republican governors have rapidly emerged as an influential bloc of opposition.
They have complained to the White House about reductions they see as harmful or
arbitrary, and they plan to pressure members of Congress from their states to
oppose them.

Of acute concern to Republicans are a handful of low-profile programs aimed at
job training and economic revitalization, including regional development
agencies like the Appalachian commission and the Delta Regional Authority, which
serves eight Southern and Midwestern states, seven of them with Republican
governors. They are also protective of grants from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development and a $3.4 billion job training program funded through the
Labor Department.

Mr. Trump's budget office has proposed to eliminate or deeply slash funding for
all of those programs, along with dozens of others.

Kim S. Rueben, a budget expert at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said the
retrenchment in Mr. Trump's spending plan appeared to be significantly out of
step with his campaign promises to use the federal government as a machine for
creating jobs, especially in distressed Midwestern and rural areas.

''It just seems like you're going after places that are so pivotal to what you
are arguing you wanted to do for your base,'' Ms. Rueben said of Mr. Trump's
budget. ''They're cutting all sorts of infrastructure projects and economic
development projects at the same time that the president is still talking about
how much of an investment he's going to put into infrastructure.''

The White House's proposed cuts would be felt in matters well beyond economic
development: A budget briefing circulated last week by the National Governors
Association, a nonpartisan group, identified a long list of Trump-backed cuts to
programs that support states. They include the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program, a $3 billion project in the Department of Health and Human Services
that helps people pay for heating and air-conditioning, and the Community
Development Block Grant program, a $3 billion initiative of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development that funds local projects from affordable housing
to Meals on Wheels.

Those cuts could come on top of a potentially huge restructuring of the federal
Medicaid program under a Republican-backed health care law. A number of
Republican governors, including John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of
Nevada, have publicly criticized the bill under consideration in the House of
Representatives because they say it would impose an impossible fiscal burden on
states.

Republicans have long argued for a more limited federal role in matters of
economic engineering and social welfare, preferring to collect less tax revenue
at the national level and hand over responsibility for a range of programs to
state and local governments. But in practice, state leaders in both parties
often balk at taking on such burdens.

Some of the governors who have voiced worry about the White House budget are
among the country's most conservative. Far from welcoming additional
responsibilities, many of them have focused intently on limiting the size and
cost of state government.

Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama said he intended to push back against planned
cuts to the Appalachian and Mississippi Delta economic agencies, as well as to
the community development grants.

''The Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority and the
Community Development Block Grants are important resources that provide funding
that benefits rural projects such as infrastructure improvement, job creation,
technology upgrades and school programs,'' Mr. Bentley said in a statement.
''Along with my governor colleagues in the A.R.C. and D.R.A., I look forward to
sharing with Washington how vital these assets are to our poorest and smallest
communities.''

Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas has already told the administration his
objections to its plans for the Delta Regional Authority, which gave $10 million
in federal grants to states last year, and which the White House budget would
eliminate.

Mr. Hutchinson ''wants to make sure the Delta is not cut off from necessary
economic development funding,'' said J. R. Davis, a spokesman for the governor.
''It's a relied upon program.''

So far, the administration has no apparent strategy to placate uneasy Republican
governors. When Mr. Mulvaney, the budget director, briefed a bipartisan group of
governors and their aides by telephone last week, he spent just a few minutes on
a broad synopsis of the administration's spending plans and took no questions
before turning the call over to a member of the White House staff, according to
four people on the call, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity
because it was intended to be private.

By way of defending such extensive cuts, Mr. Mulvaney said simply that the White
House's priority was military spending and that other reductions were necessary
to advance that goal.

After Mr. Mulvaney left the call, White House aides spent about 20 minutes
taking down polite complaints from leaders in both parties, including
Republicans like Mr. Bevin and Paul R. LePage, the governor of Maine and a
strong supporter of Mr. Trump, who said he was concerned about cuts to housing
for the poor. (Spokeswomen for Mr. Bevin and Mr. LePage declined to comment.)

But the aides offered no clear reassurances to the governors, according to
people on the call, merely pledging over and over to get back with answers to
their questions.

''It was, 'We'll get back to you on that,''' recalled Pat Pitney, the budget
director for Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska, a former Republican who was elected as
an independent.

Ms. Pitney said that there was considerable skepticism among governors that Mr.
Trump would be able to enact his budget, but that states heavily dependent on
federal money were already forming coalitions to oppose some provisions. Many of
those alliances are likely to transcend partisan divisions, Ms. Pitney said, as
states team up on matters of regional importance.

''There are going to be a lot of these things that don't fall on party lines,
because it's so impactful to the communities that the Congress and the Senate
represent,'' Ms. Pitney predicted, adding of the proposed cuts, ''I think there
are some that are dead on arrival, but not every one is dead on arrival.''

For all their private unease, only a few Republican governors have openly
criticized Mr. Trump's budget. Advisers to several of them, including some who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they saw little benefit to doing so,
since they believe the budget is all but doomed in Congress already. Leaders in
both the House and Senate have indicated that they are unlikely to pass it in
anything resembling its current form, and some have already lined up with their
party's restive governors: Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority
leader, has publicly vowed to oppose any cuts to the Appalachian Regional
Commission of the kind Mr. Bevin fears.

Aides to multiple governors, in both red and blue states, signaled that they
doubted Congress would pass any budget at all, let alone one as disruptive as
Mr. Trump's.

Stephanie Wilson, a spokeswoman for Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana, a Republican
elected in November, said the governor's office would work closely with
Indiana's largely Republican congressional delegation to defend state
priorities.

''But we understand the budget process is a long one,'' Ms. Wilson cautioned in
an email. ''The president's proposal will need to work its way through
Congress.''

Amelia Chassé, a spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, was perhaps even
more direct: Asked about Mr. Trump's proposal to wipe out funding for cleanup of
the Chesapeake Bay, Ms. Chassé said Mr. Hogan, a Republican, supported restoring
the bay and would address the White House budget as necessary.

''If any of these proposals ever become law or even draft legislation,'' she
said, ''we will take a serious look at how to address them during our own budget
process.''

The 24th annual World Partnership Walk raising awareness and funds to fight
global poverty is being added to the list of B.C.'s 150th anniversary
celebrations, the B.C. Ministry of Tourism, Sport and the Arts announced
Thursday.

The Vancouver walk will begin at Lumberman's Arch in Stanley Park on May 25, and
in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria the same day.

Since the walk was founded by the Aga Khan Foundation in Vancouver 24 years ago
it has raised more than $40 million, and last year alone $5 million was
collected to fund education, improve health care, increase rural homes and build
community organizations in Asia and Africa.

Victoria hit hard

Police say three people arrested in a high-profile emergency takedown on a
Victoria street may be part of an organized crime group that runs debit and
credit card scams.

Two men and a woman were arrested near Douglas Street and Hillside Avenue late
Tuesday afternoon after a short chase. One man was pepper-sprayed in his
vehicle, said police. The woman and another man were arrested after officers
from the Emergency Response Team detonated a stun grenade near a busy
intersection.

"We are investigating the possibility that they are connected to the recent
incidents involving PIN-pad thefts," said police Sgt. Grant Hamilton.

Since December, a group of thieves with what police say are links to organized
crime has hit numerous businesses in Greater Victoria, capturing bank account
data from several hundred customers and stealing thousands from their bank
accounts. Banks generally refund the victims.

Police have seized seven hacked debit machines from the region. Each hacked PIN
pad causes, on average, $100,000 worth of fraud, police say.

$1 million richer

The Delta Hospice Society is getting a welcome dose of financial relief with a
$1-million donation from the Delta business community. The society is building a
hospice residence that will be the only in-patient hospice facility in the Delta
area, providing end-of-life care, information and support for those who need it.
It is scheduled for completion in 2009.

State health care group to continue work

BYLINE: Tim Carpenter.

THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL

LENGTH: 543 words


Kansas' task force studying implementation of national health insurance reform
decided against throwing in the policy towel Wednesday in aftermath of Gov. Sam
Brownback's controversial decision to return a $31.5 million federal grant
earmarked for the project.

The 45-member group opted to continue to breathe life into recommendations aimed
at Brownback and the 2012 Legislature for deployment of the computer-based
exchange system to comply with federal law that nearly all Kansans obtain health
insurance.

Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said the group would persist with the clear
understanding Brownback and many conservative legislators in the House and
Senate harbored deep objections to the vision of an exchange network. The tool
would help consumers compare policies and prices.

"We should at least give it our best effort," Praeger said. "I still think the
best course of action is trying to be ready."

In early August, Brownback shocked the state's health and insurance industries,
as well as top state political leaders, by reversing course and issuing an order
sending back the $31.5 million to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.

Federal law requires each state to make operable by 2014 a system capable of
allowing consumers to review, enroll and pay for health insurance. An estimated
20,000 residents of Shawnee County without insurance would be part of an
exchange in Kansas.

If the governor and GOP-led Legislature chooses not to permit an exchange in
Kansas, federal law allows HHS to inject a system.

For months, Praeger has led the task force of medical, insurance and public
policy specialists that worked to form outlines of an exchange. The governor's
move raised questions among members about the necessity of continuing the
effort.

Former Attorney General Robert Stephan, a member of the state advisory panel,
said his enthusiasm was dealt a blow upon learning of Brownback's unilateral
decision to relinquish federal funding.

"My first reaction was to hell with it," he said. "I'm very pessimistic."

Brownback opposed "Obamacare," but initially he didn't stand in the way of the
HHS grant to Kansas. Kansas Republican Party activists responded by pressuring
Brownback to punt the "innovation" grant to the HHS agency led by former Kansas
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius.

During the meeting of Praeger's advisory board in Topeka, representatives of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Delta Dental of Kansas and Coventry Health
Care of Kansas urged colleagues to keep working on a state-crafted exchange
rather than surrender to the possibility of a federally designed model.

"It's clear we need to do something," said task force member Sheldon Weisgrau,
who works as a consumer advocate with the Kansas Reform Resource Project in
Topeka. "We have serious problems in our health system."

Praeger said the state had a separate $1 million federal appropriation that
would be used to take preliminary steps toward an exchange. Removal of $31.5
million from the mix undercut the state's ability to pay for full development,
she said.

The federal health reform law is under constitutional challenge likely to be
resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. A point of contention is the requirement
Americans obtain insurance under threat of penalty.

Community centers changing the face of health care;
6UEST PERSPECTIVE

BYLINE: Sedona Red Rock News staff

LENGTH: 537  words


Sometimes the greatest innovations in health care happen right in our own
communities. Fifty years ago, one of those innovations took root in two clinics
-- one in the Mississippi Delta and one in South Boston, Mass. These clinics,
started as demonstration projects of the Health Center Program, offered
high-quality primary care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay.

Fifty years later, 1,300 health centers operate 9,000 sites nationwide and serve
Americans in every state. In fact, one out of every 14 people living in the
United States received health care from a health center in their community last
year. Health centers play a critical role in our health care system.

They open the doors to that system for millions of Americans. Since the passage
of the Affordable Care Act, health centers have helped more than 10 million
people learn about their options for health coverage, and how to enroll in
coverage. As a result of their work, health centers have seen a significant drop
in the percent of uninsured patients getting care at their facilities.

We need to support this high-quality, community-centered care. That's why the
Department of Health and Human Services announced $169 million in Affordable
Care Act funding for 266 new health center sites in 46 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico, increasing access to health care services for
approximately 1.2 million additional patients. With these resources, our
nation's health centers can continue to improve the lives of families in rural
and urban communities.

Here in Arizona, these new funds mean that eight Arizona community health
centers will receive grant funds that will enable them to serve an additional
42,389 Arizonans in medically underserved areas of the state.

Health centers don't just connect millions of Americans with health care. They
also improve the health care delivery. Thanks to their work and the tools
provided by the Affordable Care Act, we are transforming our health care system
into one that works for all people, no matter where they live.

Health centers play a crucial role in putting the consumer in the center of
their care. Across the country, 92 percent have adopted electronic health
records, improved integrated primary care services and many have earned
patient-centered medical home status, one of the most promising models of
coordinated care centered on a patient's needs.

Health centers do this great work for a simple reason. When we put educated and
empowered patients in the center of their care, we get better outcomes and we
strengthen our health care system.

With the help of health centers, we can get more people covered and we can help
empower them to take control of their care and live healthier lives.

For half a century, the Health Center Program has changed and grown, but at its
core it has had one priority: Giving our friends and neighbors the building
blocks they need to live healthy, productive lives. Arizona is stronger and our
communities are healthier because of the work they do.

Melissa Stafford Jones is the Region IX Director for the United States
Department of Health and Human Services. John C. McDonald is the CEO of the
Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers.

Include Dental Care In Health Reform

I am concerned that with all the media's reporting on health-care reform there
is one area that is being neglected - dental care. According to the Institute of
Medicine, dental insurance programs save $ 4 billion dollars a year through
their emphasis on prevention, early detection and treatment.

Current proposals before Congress do not provide for comprehensive dental
benefits for all Americans. The worst part is that several proposals would
actually make dental benefits more difficult and maybe even impossible to
obtain, due to taxes on benefits.

The overall state of dental health for Americans is at a record high, with oral
disease on the decline and dental costs decreasing as a share of total health
expenditures.  This is at a time when there are more dentists practicing, more
patients with dental insurance and more patients seeking care from the dentist
on a regular basis.

Health-care reform, including dental, should be about encouraging people to seek
out cost-effective preventive care. Congress needs to make sure that dental
benefits are included in the national plan for the 150 million Americans who do
not have coverage - and avoid taxing the dental benefits of the 95 million
American workers who do have coverage.

We need to put the teeth back into health-care reform. Karen M. Bettlach Delta
Dental of Missouri University City Neighborhood Plan

The urban revitalization demonstration planning grant will not fund the
modernization of the existing Darst-Webbe public housing development. Rather, it
could lead to the demolition of the existing towers and create a comprehensive
neighborhood improvement plan.

A June 21 Post-Dispatch article failed to explain that the planning grant
awarded to the St. Louis Housing Authority seeks creative and innovative
approaches to public housing as well as its surrounding neighborhoods.
Unfortunately, the article makes no reference to the comprehensive approach of
this project, which stresses community involvement and neighborhood
stabilization.

In fact, the demonstration program designed by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development insists on community input and mandates that local and private
entities participate in the planning process. The Housing Authority has
solicited this involvement by creating an oversight committee. This committee
has already provided extensive input. The committee is composed of local
legislative representatives, religious leaders, business persons, city officials
and public housing residents.

Through this collective input, the St. Louis plan will reflect a creative
approach to resolving the "brick and mortar" issues affecting public housing, as
well as outlining a comprehensive design for the surrounding neighborhood.

The grant demands that public housing authorities address overall neighborhood
development. This includes developing social service opportunities, facilitating
business opportunities within the area and developing job-training programs. The
Post-Dispatch article failed to emphasize that this program focuses on the
entire Darst-Webbe neighborhood, not just public housing.

Alderman Phyllis Young understands the intent of the revitalization program. She
correctly identified this funding as totally "different from what has been
considered in the past." HUD officials reinforce this. Though they stipulate
that this program "can be used to improve both public housing and the
neighborhood around it," they acknowledge that the plan allows for the
demolition of obsolete public housing.

We believe this is a worthwhile program that allows the collective community to
design a plan simultaneously that will change public housing "as we know it" and
enhance neighborhood stability. Rev. Richard J. Quirk Chairman Thom Clark
Assistant to the Executive Director St. Louis Housing Authority St. Louis
Nuclear Time Bomb

Jimmy Carter announced that the Korean crisis is over. What a relief!

It gives me the same peace of mind as a recent editorial in the People's Daily
World (a publication of the Communist Party, USA). It states that North Korea is
a peace-loving country with no intention of making a nuclear weapon. Such ugly
rumors are caused by falsified U.S. intelligence reports.

Bill Clinton said during his campaign that the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction is "one of the most dangerous of new threats." As soon as he became
president he responded to this threat by gutting the Strategic Defense
Initiative. The president apparently doesn't buy North Korea's peaceful
intentions, but he goes along whole hog with the People's Daily World
recommendations that we dismantle our military forces.

North Korea, like several other nations, is developing a nuclear capability at
breakneck speed. All of Carter's blandishments will not slow its progress the
slightest. This is the same Jimmy Carter who solved an impasse with Panama by
giving away the canal - and promising to pay the costs of operation!

No one knows yet what carrot he offered North Korea for an empty promise, but I
wouldn't be surprised if the people of Alaska or Hawaii are a little nervous.

The development and deployment of nuclear weapons around the world are
proceeding like a ticking time bomb and nothing will slow it. Certainly not the
Non-Proliferation Treaty nor other treaties or other futile efforts that are so
dear to our diplomats.

We must deploy our SDI system and create a nuclear strike force that can provide
a nuclear umbrella for protecting our allies. It would be cheaper than futile
efforts to buy peace from rogue nations one at a time. Leon U. Jameton
University City Spending Controls

The Hancock II Amendment would not require massive cuts in education, prison and
mental health spending. It would require the Missouri Legislature to get voter
approval to spend tax dollars.

Initially, it calls for reversing some spending, but these dollars are not
irretrievably lost. All it would require is approval of the voters to continue
funding for these programs.

Despite what many lawmakers and the governor think, the voters in Missouri are
not out of touch with the needs of this state. What we have lost touch with is
our tax dollars. Hancock II would allow us to control the spending of the tax
money that we pay. Gary Carr Florissant A Father's Duties

Our (male) Congress is telling welfare mothers that their responsibilities are
working and raising children. The children of welfare mothers have fathers -
somewhere. Fathers of children on welfare should also be mandated to receive
training that teaches the responsibilities of fatherhood.

If we want to correct many of our social problems,    men who choose to ignore
the responsibilities of fatherhood, regardless of their economic status or
relationship with the mother, should receive training that teaches the meaning
of manhood. Sharon Jackson Arnold A Beautiful City

Three years ago I moved to the Eastern Shore of Virginia after having lived in
St. Louis all my life. I recently returned for a visit and stopped by my old
haunts - the Central West End, Lafayette Square, downtown, University City and
Clayton.

I would like to congratulate the people of St. Louis. You have made it a truly
beautiful city. I was very impressed with the cleanliness. I did not see one
piece of paper in the streets or on the sidewalks. The combination of new and
old buildings made the city sparkle. The diversity was really a joy to see. I
loved watching people walking in the downtown area, having lunch at sidewalk
cafes and strolling through neighborhoods.

I am looking forward to another visit. A job well done, St. Louisans. Carol
Siempelkamp Exmore, Va.

OIL PRICES GROUND AIRLINE PROFITS: Airlines will lose as much as $6-billion this
year on international routes if oil prices stay at the record highs reached
Tuesday, the International Air Transport Association said. "We went from
forecasting a gain of $3-billion at the beginning of the year to a $6-billion
loss now," said Anthony Concil, a spokesman for IATA in Geneva. IATA, which
represents more than 270 airlines worldwide, had based its prediction of a
profit on an average price of $30 per barrel. Giovanni Bisignani, the
association's director general, said June 7 the industry would break even if the
price averaged $33 a barrel this year.

DELTA PILOTS WANT PAIN SHARED: Delta Air Lines' pilots union said Wednesday the
struggling carrier will edge closer to bankruptcy if management continues to
seek $1-billion in concessions from them without asking other stakeholders to
tighten their belts. The chairman of the union's executive committee, John
Malone, made the comment in a strongly worded letter to other pilots. The letter
was a response to the Atlanta airline's request Friday for the pilots union to
give up $1-billion in concessions, including a 35 percent pay cut and work,
scheduling and pension changes.

US AIRWAYS MAY DEFAULT: US Airways Group Inc., seeking cost cuts to avoid a
second bankruptcy filing, said it may default on terms of a U.S. loan guarantee
this quarter. US Airways "anticipates risk of failing to comply" with
requirements for the $900-million guarantee as of Sept. 30, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Air Transport
Stabilization Board, set up after the 2001 terrorist attacks to oversee
guarantee grants, gave US Airways backing for a $1-billion loan that financed
its exit from bankruptcy in April 2003. The board could demand repayment, the
filing said.

EU SUGAR SUBSIDIES IN VIOLATION: The World Trade Organization found European
Union subsidies for sugar producers violate global trade rules, upholding a
complaint filed by Brazil, Australia and Thailand, Brazilian foreign minister
Celso Amorim said. A preliminary ruling by the trade body found that the EU has
violated limits on export subsidies, Amorim said. Amorim declined to offer
details of the ruling, but told reporters in Brasilia it was a victory for
Brazil's sugar producers, who have complained for years that they could
significantly boost exports if the subsidies were eliminated.

BELLSOUTH UNION OKAYS STRIKE: The roughly 47,000 union employees at BellSouth
Corp. have authorized a strike if they can't reach a fair contract with
management, officials said Wednesday. Key sticking points include health care
costs and job security at the Atlanta company. The three-year contract between
BellSouth and the Communications Workers of America expires at midnight
Saturday. While a strike has been approved, no deadline or date has been set,
said CWA spokeswoman Candice Johnson.

SEN. KERRY TO CHAIR SMALL BUSINESS PANEL

Sen. John Kerry has been named chairman of the Senate Committee on Small
Business & Entrepreneurship. The Boston Democrat is one of many Bay State
congressmen expected to benefit with chairmanships because of the Democrats'
rise to majority power in Washington.

Kerry's priorities include reducing paperwork for small businesses, reforming
the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program and focusing on making
health care more affordable for small businesses. Kerry was chairman of the
committee in 2001 and 2002.

MUGAR PLEDGES$5m TO CAPE COD HOSPITAL

HYANNIS - Philanthropist David Mugar has pledged up to $5 million to Cape Cod
Hospital to help complete a wing that was started with a  $5 million donation he
made in 2002.

At the time, the donation was the largest in the hospital's 82-year-history.
Mugar's latest donation for the $17 million project is in the form of a
challenge grant: The Cotuit resident will match other donations,
dollar-for-dollar, up to $5 million toward the completion of the wing's top two
patient floors.

1½-YEAR SENTENCE  ON FRAUD CHARGES

BOSTON - A Dorchester man was sentenced in U.S. District Court on Monday to one
year and six months in prison on charges of fraudulently obtaining public
housing benefits and student loans.

David Murray-McCarthy, 38,  also was  ordered to pay  $139,000 in restitution.
He pleaded guilty in June to three charges of making false statements.
Prosecutors said Murray-McCarthy underreported his income to get Section 8
housing benefits and made false statements to federal agencies to get student
loans after defaulting on previous loans. Prosecutors also  said he lied to the
Social Security Administration to obtain disability benefits.

HONEY DEW DONUTS OFFERS GIFT CARDS

PLAINVILLE - Honey Dew Donuts has become the latest fast-food chain to offer
gift cards in time for the holidays.  The Plainville-based chain launched the
program this month and said that it has been embraced by nearly all its

England, is preparing to launch a print and outdoor ad campaign to advertise its
holiday promotions.

2 NEW STATE STREET GLOBAL  FUNDS TRACK JAPANESE STOCKS

BOSTON - State Street Global Advisors has launched its first two international
exchange-traded funds. The Boston-based firm's two funds track Japan-focused
indexes.  One focuses on Japan's 1,000 largest stocks and another focuses on the
smallest 15 percent of firms in Japan.

State Street said it plans to create more ETFs to focus on other overseas
markets. An exchange-traded fund follows the movements of a particular stock
index, and can be traded and repriced throughout the day like a stock.

protection would give Delta's unsecured creditors $4 billion in cash and 78.5
million shares of US Airways stock.

If the deal is completed, the airline would operate under the Delta name and
serve more than 350 destinations across five continents.

GOVERNMENT PENSIONS IN DANGER Many local governments began turning to their
pension funds to help pay for health care for retired public workers in the
1990s. After years of investment losses and double-digit increases in health
care costs, some are now regretting it as their funds for retiree health care
and overall pensions are running out. [Page A1.]



GOVERNOR WARNS OF CRISIS Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that he was
considering a ''serious restructuring'' of pension and health care benefits for
state employees because soaring costs would make it impossible for the state to
keep pace over the next decade. [B5.]

EYES ON THE CORNER OFFICE As early as today, Delta Air Lines will file its plan
to operate after bankruptcy. Delta's argument to remain independent and fend off
an $8.5 billion bid from US Airways will also make the case by extension for
Edward H. Bastian and James M. Whitehurst, the two executives running Delta, to
keep their jobs -- and for one of them, perhaps, to become chief executive.

instead, a person briefed on the companies' plans said. [C1.]

DEAL FOR CLOTHING CHAIN American Apparel, the casual clothing chain whose
socially conscious manufacturing, sexually charged advertising and snug-fitting
T-shirts have generated a cultlike following, will be sold to a little-known
investment firm for $382.5 million, according to people briefed on the matter.

FANNIE MAE SUES ITS EX-CHIEF Fannie Mae's main regulator sued Franklin D.
Raines, its former chairman and chief executive, and two top financial officers
in an effort to exact more than $215 million in bonus payouts and fines over
their roles in a huge accounting scandal. [C1.]

EX-EDITOR SPARS WITH NEWS CORP. Judith Regan's authors are still reeling from
their publisher's abrupt dismissal, and the sparring between the headline-making
Ms. Regan and her former employer, the News Corporation, has grown more intense,
more personal and more specific over accusations that she had made anti-Semitic
comments that prompted her firing. [C1.]

TRANSIT PROJECTS TO GET AID After decades of planning and dreaming by officials,
two major expansions of New York City's mass transit system took important steps
forward, with the federal government promising to pay billions of dollars for a
Long Island Rail Road connection to Grand Central Terminal and for a Second
Avenue subway. [B1.]

OFFER PUTS PRESSURE ON UNIONS A group of private equity firms said that they
were willing to invest up to $3.4 billion in the Delphi Corporation when it
emerges from Chapter 11, but the offer hinges on Delphi's reaching a new labor
agreement with its unions by Jan. 31. [C7.]

SMALL CARS COME UP SHORT Small cars are back in vogue in the wake of high gas
prices, but most fail to provide the same protection that buyers find in bigger
vehicles, according to the results of new tests. [C7.]

MARKETS SLIP DESPITE DEALS Wall Street fell for the first time in four sessions
as concerns about the technology and energy sectors overshadowed some $81
billion in takeover activity. [C10.]

LILLY RAISES OFFER FOR ICOS Eli Lilly raised its offer for the Icos Corporation
by 6 percent, to $34 a share, or $2.3 billion, in advance of a vote on the deal
that two proxy firms were advising against. [C10.]

AOL PLANS FOR THE LONG HAUL Randy Falco, the new chief executive of AOL, made
his first move to demonstrate that the company was not for sale and was making
plans for the long haul. Mr. Falco, left, reorganized the executive suite so
that eight people are reporting directly to him, including AOL's vice chairman,
Ted Leonsis, along with functions like human resources, legal and finance. [C1.]


MINING COMPANY SELLS SHARES The largest gold mining company in Russia, Polyus,

London that the Kremlin had begun a program to nationalize Siberia's gold
fields. [C12.]

Cardinal Health Foundation Provides $1.1 Million in Grant Funding to Improve
Patient Safety at the Point-of-Care

LENGTH: 619  words


New Delhi, July 30 -- The Cardinal Health Foundation today announced 42 grants,
totaling nearly $1.1 million, to help U.S. hospitals, health systems and
community health organizations improve the effectiveness, efficiency and
excellence of patient care.

The Cardinal Health E3 Grant Program awarded funding of up to $30,000 per grant
to health care providers in 25 states. For the third consecutive year, this
competitive grant program specifically encouraged providers to submit funding
requests for programs that seek to improve medication management or operating
room safety. Since the inception of the E3 Grant Program in 2008, the Cardinal
Health Foundation has awarded 189 grants totaling more than $5 million.

As part of this program, the Cardinal Health Foundation also awarded
scholarships to 50 healthcare organizations to underwrite the cost of health
care professionals to attend professional development programs led by the
Institute for Healthcare Improvement. These programs seek to teach health care
professionals how to create a culture of patient safety within their facilities.


"We're pleased to support health care providers that are working to implement
best practices and improve the effectiveness, excellence and efficiency of
patient care," said Shelley Bird, executive vice president of public affairs for
Cardinal Health and chairperson of the Cardinal Health Foundation. "We
congratulate this year's winners and their work to achieve meaningful, long-term
improvements."

Organizations receiving funding from the 2012 Cardinal Health E3 Grant Program
include:

* Austen BioInnovation Institute In Akron (Akron, OH)

* Bayfront Medical Center (St. Petersburg, FL)

* Candler Hospital (Savannah, GA)

* Capital Region Medical Center (Jefferson City, MO)

* Central Maine Medical Center (Lewiston, ME)

* Christus Health Ark-La-Tex (Texarkana, TX)

* Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH)

CHEYENNE

Max Maxfield to announce for re-election as secretary of state

Max Maxfield plans to announce his candidacy for re-election as Wyoming
Secretary of State next Wednesday with appearances in Cheyenne and Casper.

According to a news release sent Thursday by e-mail, Maxfield will be in Casper
at noon that day, then at the Cheyenne Holiday Inn, 204 West Fox Farm Road at
5:30 p.m.

The public is invited to attend the announcement.

Airport to receive federal grant money to rehabilitate taxiways

The Cheyenne Regional Airport will receive almost $700,000 in federal grant
money, Wyoming's congressional delegation announced Thursday.

U.S. Sens. Mike Enzi and John Barrasso and Rep. Cynthia Lummis, all R-Wyo., said
in a news release that 11 Wyoming airports will receive a total of more than
$7.3 million in grant money.

The Cheyenne Regional Airport/Jerry Olson Field will get more than $687,000 to
rehabilitate taxiways A3 and B2.

The Department of Transportation is distributing grants through the Federal
Aviation Administration to airports in Afton, Casper, Cheyenne, Fort Bridger,
Hulett, Jackson, Kemmerer, Newcastle, Riverton, Rock Springs, and Sheridan.

Department of Revenue warns against new credit card scam

A new scam tries to get consumer credit card information by selling an illegal,
and nonexistent, certificate, the Wyoming Department of Revenue is warning.

Dan Noble, administrator of the Excise Tax Division of the department, said in a
news release that the Web site offers to sell fake "Sales Tax Resale Certificate
Numbers" for all 50 states and fraudulent federal tax identification numbers for
$37 each.

"We say this time and time again, but if something sounds too good to be true,
it almost certainly is," Noble said in the release. "You can't buy a certificate
for $37 - or for any price - to avoid paying sales tax."

The division has notified law enforcement about this particular Web sit,e but
there may be others like it. "The Department of Revenue is the only agency that
can assign a license number to do business in Wyoming," Noble said.

If you have bought such a certificate, you should contact your bank or credit
card issuer immediately.

Questions about legitimate Wyoming license numbers can be directed to the
Wyoming Department of Revenue at 777-7961.

CHIP program awarded federal grant money to improve health care

Wyoming has been awarded a federal grant to help improve health-care quality and
delivery systems for children with serious behavioral health disorders who are
enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

The CHIP program is known in Wyoming as Kid Care CHIP; the state's Medicaid
program is known as EqualityCare.

Wyoming partnered with Maryland, Georgia and the Centers for Health Care
Strategies to submit a grant application, which was awarded nearly $11 million.
Wyoming's share will be $450,000 per year for five years, according to the
Wyoming Department of Health.

Wyoming will use the federal grant to implement and evaluate provider
performance measures and use health information technologies such as pediatric
electronic health records. A key planned strategy is the use of a care
management entity to help monitor and administer mental health services provided
to eligible Wyoming children.

Foundation gives $200,000 to Promise Healthcare

BYLINE: Debra Pressey, The News-Gazette, Champaign-Urbana, Ill.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 379 words


Jan. 30--CHAMPAIGN _ Frances Nelson Health Center, which was largely closed to
new patients before last year, added 1,200 new patients in the last half of 2013
and stands ready to take in more.

A $200,000 gift from the Carle Foundation, the second financial gift announced
this week for Frances Nelson's parent organization, Promise Healthcare, is
helping pay for new health care providers who are opening up new appointment
spots at the health center, says Promise Healthcare Executive Director Nancy
Greenwalt.

Greenwalt said there have been three new advanced practice nurses added in the
last year at Frances Nelson, a federally qualified health center in Champaign,
with the latest addition joining the clinic in December and starting to see new
patients last month.

With the newest nurse on board, she said, the health center can add at least
1,200 more new patients this year.

Greenwalt said the goal is to make Frances Nelson the primary medical home for
the medically underserved in Champaign-Urbana, and that includes people who are
uninsured and covered under the state Medicaid program.

New patients need to verify their income eligibility, she said.

However, Greenwalt adds, "The doors are wide open. We're very welcoming."

The Carle gift was designated through the United Way of Champaign County, and
followed a $100,000 award Promise Healthcare said Monday it will receive from
the Delta Dental Foundation of Illinois.

The money from Delta Dental Foundation's Wisdom Tooth Award will be spread over
two years to help SmileHealthy integrate dental care with primary medical care
for children at Frances Nelson. Dental hygienists visiting prenatal and child
wellness clinics will work with families to get them established in dental
health, Greenwalt said.

SmileHealthy will be able to add clinic days for children at the dental center,
and through its mobile program, but appointments for new adult patients through
the dental center remain limited, Greenwalt said.

New adult dental patients can call on Friday mornings for appointments that are
made for the next two weeks, but dental emergencies are seen sooner, she said.

Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation's Together on Diabetes Initiative Marks First
Anniversary by Awarding $18.4 Million in Grants to Help Communities Hardest Hit
by Diabetes, Issuing Annual Report

LENGTH: 1106  words


New Delhi, Nov. 14 -- The Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation today marked World
Diabetes Day and the first anniversary of its Together on Diabetes initiative by
awarding eight grants totaling $18.4 million to help communities and populations
disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes. The grants will help develop
effective, comprehensive solutions that integrate public health, health care
services, community supportive services and the strengths of the communities in
order to improve health outcomes and reduce disease burden.

Together on Diabetes: Communities Uniting to Meet America's Diabetes Challenge
is a five-year, $100 million initiative to improve health outcomes for American
adults living with type 2 diabetes. Together on Diabetes focuses on
strengthening patient self-management and mobilizing community-based supportive
services to help adults disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes,
consistent with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation's mission to reduce global
health disparities.

The eight grants announced today focus on communities or populations with high
prevalence and burden of type 2 diabetes: Native Americans, Appalachia, the
Mississippi Delta region, urban and rural poor, people who are food insecure and
people who suffer from both depression and diabetes.

"Type 2 diabetes is continuing to grow year to year in the U.S. despite
significant prevention and control efforts," says John Damonti, president of the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation. "The creative projects of our partners are
challenging and expanding current thinking and laying important groundwork for
more comprehensive and impactful diabetes control efforts going forward."

The following organizations received Together on Diabetes grants:

* Duke University Medical Center and the Durham County (N.C.) Department of
Health and Human Services will receive $6.25 million over five years to develop,
pilot and implement a series of community-based interventions designed to
improve diabetes self-management, health outcomes and quality of life for
diagnosed and undiagnosed adults with type 2 diabetes in the county.

* Feeding America,in partnership with the Food Bank of Corpus Christi, the
Mid-Ohio Foodbank, and the Redwood Empire Food Bank, will receive $3.1 million
over three years to create and pilot food bank-health center partnerships that
will provide diabetes screening, care coordination, nutrition and disease
education, and healthy foods to adults who are living with type 2 diabetes and
are food insecure.

* The Camden (N.J.) Coalition of Healthcare Providers and the Cooper Foundation
will receive $3.45 million over five years to strengthen community-based
components of its Camden Citywide Diabetes Collaborative care model by focusing
on patient self-management, education and support, care coordination, food
access and physical activity programs, and behavioral health and community
engagement activities in order to bend the curve of the diabetes burden and
health care costs in the city.

* Marshall University Center for Rural Health, in partnership with the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Appalachian Regional
Commission, will receive $2.61 million over five years to build the capacity of
10 community diabetes coalitions to implement evidence-based programs that
support long-term behavior change and improve the health of people living with
type 2 diabetes.

* Mississippi Public Health Institute, in partnership with the Mississippi
Department of Health, University of Mississippi Medical Center and the
Mississippi Division of Medicaid, will receive $504,000 to develop a
coordinated, evidence-based, community approach to systematically lower the
incidence and severity of diabetes in 18 Delta Region counties by integrating
existing medical and non-medical systems of care, supporting the creation of
patient-centered medical homes and developing policies that positively impact
environmental and social determinants of health related to 2 diabetes.

* National Network of Public Health Institutes (NNPHI) will receive $180,144 to
develop and host a two-day summit in the first quarter of 2012 for Together on
Diabetes grantees, support the Learning Collaboratives for the grantees, and
strengthen relationships between Together on Diabetes grantees and the broader
public health practice community.

* Riverview Medical Center Foundation will receive $50,856 to pilot a modified
Wellness Recovery Action Plan model for type 2 diabetes patients who also are
suffering from or at risk of developing depression, a common co-morbidity of
diabetes.

In addition, Together on Diabetes will partner with the Johns Hopkins Center for
American Indian Health to pioneer intergenerational, family- and
community-focused interventions for type 2 diabetes in four tribal communities
in the Southwestern United States. Johns Hopkins will receive $2.25 million over
two years to adapt a family health coach model to address diabetes prevention
and care, screening and diagnosis, healthy lifestyle behavior change, and
patient/family self-management. American Indians and Alaska natives suffer the
highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the nation - as high as one in three in the
Navajo and Apache communities this partnership will target.

"Diabetes, which has become a leading cause of morbidity around the world,
affects Native American populations at disproportionately high rates. There is
an urgent need to investigate innovative, community-driven ways to prevent and
treat diabetes," says Mathuram Santosham, M.D., M.P.H., director of the Center
for American Indian Health and a professor in the departments of international
health and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health in
Baltimore, Maryland. "In the past century, research conducted in collaboration
with Native American populations has led to medical interventions that have
saved millions of lives around the world," adds Dr. Santosham. "I believe that
Native American populations will once again pave the way to groundbreaking
research to tackle the global burden from this dreadful disease."

Together on Diabetes also today issued its first annual report, which profiles
the projects of its national, community, government and academic partners.
Together on Diabetes has awarded 17 grants totaling $32.57 million since its
launch on World Diabetes Day last year.

Reinforcing the Cold War victory myth

SECTION: EDITORIAL; LETTERS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 1001 words



Re: Bush swims against a postwar current, Oct. 5, by Charles Krauthammer,
reinforces the myth that Reagan and Bush won the Cold War. If either of them
had foreseen the demise of the Soviet Union, why didn't they address factory
conversion years ago?

According to a recent New York Times article, only about $ 20-million has  been
spent by the federal government so far for the transition to peacetime
pursuits, and one reason for the delay is a turf war between the Commerce,
Labor and Defense Departments. In the absence of presidential leadership, many
states have their own programs and Mario Cuomo leads the group with  $
10-million, mostly to wean small companies from military work. Seymour  Melman,
author of The Permanent War Economy, and for many years a voice crying  in the
wilderness for conversion, says, "Pentagon contracts are awash in  billions
while the infrastructure that underpins our economy collapses and  human misery
spreads." He warned years ago that building a colossal military  power while
Germany and Japan had low levels of military research but big  civilian R&D,
created a brain drain of engineering and scientific talent and  brought about a
decline in productivity. He cautions that Pentagon top brass  on the premises of
defense giants' plants is not conducive to conversion and  he rebuts
Krauthammer's statement that Bush is an unappreciated wartime leader  by asking
how long we can live on a diet of parades.

The nuclear arms race, which crippled the Soviet Union and handicapped the
United States, continued for 45 years and, according to conservative  scientific
estimates, it will take 250,000 years for the nuclear waste  products to break
down. George Bush's watch was less than happenstance.

Understanding the bed tax

There appears to be some misunderstanding about the origin of the $ 1.50 per
bed per day nursing home tax.

There have been several letters to the Times on the subject and Hotline has  had
numerous telephone calls about the tax.

A news article in the Times last February clearly told the story. The idea  of
the tax did not originate in the Legislature but was a suggestion of the
Florida Health Care Association to the governor as he struggled with the state
budget. The purpose was to generate $ 25-million matching funds to secure  $
35-million funding from the federal Medicaid grants program. I understand the
tax is temporary and will expire next May unless it is renewed by the
Legislature.

It was an effort made by the nursing home industry to make it possible to
increase Medicaid reimbursement to nursing homes during this period of extreme
state budget crunch. Without question, the state does have a responsibility to
provide adequate reimbursement to nursing homes to properly care for Medicaid
residents.

Without this cooperative effort of nursing home administrators, the  governor
and the Legislature, the daily rate for private pay residents could  easily be
much higher - perhaps as much as $ 5 or $ 6 per day more.

You may be interested to know that other states are using a similar  provider
tax system to increase state revenue. For example, the Illinois  assessment is $
6 per day and in Louisiana the proposed tax is $ 10 per bed per  day.

A daily bargain

  Sixteen years ago, I recall the devastating tornado that hit Largo. My
grandparents mailed the complete copy of the St. Petersburg Times to me in New
York during August 1976. When I read over the storm history of the tornadoes  in
Largo (Times, Oct. 8, 1992) I pulled out that old newspaper and, much to my
shock, noticed the price to be 15 cents for a daily issue.

I can truly say that the St. Petersburg Times is the only commodity that  hasn't
more than doubled - if not tripled - in price since 1976.  Congratulations!

Breast cancer awareness

I write to remind your readers that October is National Breast Cancer  Awareness
month and to inform them of the American Cancer Society/WFLA-TV  Greater Tampa
Bay Breast Screening Program from Oct. 27-30.

The program, which will be highlighted by anchorwoman Barbara Callahan's  series
"A Ray of Hope" on WFLA-TV, will offer low-cost mammograms to  eligible women in
the Tampa Bay area.

My wife Priscilla and I are cancer survivors. Because she detected breast
cancer in an early, curable stage, she is still alive. If there is one message
we would tell every woman, it is: Do your self-breast exam, have a regular
mammogram, and see your physician annually as part of a complete breast health
program.

The short time it takes to schedule a mammogram during the American Cancer
Society/WFLA-TV Greater Tampa Bay Breast Screening program may save the life  of
a loved one.

During the program, your readers may call the American Cancer  Society/WFLA-TV
phone bank between 9 a.m. and midnight at 1-800-ACS-2345 to  schedule a
mammogram.

"Statistically weak' comparison

Re: Volkswagen of the skies, Oct. 8.

I enjoyed your article on Southwest Airlines. The people of Southwest  should be
justifiably proud of their earnings record and number one position  in passenger
satisfaction, a position held by Delta for a number of years.

However, a comparison between Southwest and Delta or United, American and
Northwest is statistically weak. Delta and the other airlines are full-service
global airlines with different classes of service, interline ticketing
arrangements, special meal choices, advanced seat selection and multilevel
frequent flyer programs. Southwest flies point to point, all in coach, all
domestically with no meals or advance seat selection.

Both Southwest and the other carriers do what they do well, but they're not
doing the same thing.

Hope in the Wreckage

One morning this spring, Claudia Cox, a registered nurse in Jackson, Miss.,
drove toward the countryside to visit some patients. She often has trouble
finding their homes. ''The rural people are the worst,'' she said. '' 'Come to
the oak tree.' Well, hell, I'm from the city, I don't know what no oak tree is.
I know magnolia. I know pine trees.'' Cox referred to her seven-year-old Ford
Freestyle as her ''office,'' but it had the ambience of an arcade: the
ding-ding-ding from her dashboard signaling an unbuckled seat belt, the whir of
a phone charger in the cigarette lighter, the phone ringing with the opening of
Cheryl Lynn's disco hit ''Got to Be Real.'' Cox, a 45-year-old divorced mother
of three, juggled phone calls and patients' charts and cigarettes like some
serene octopus, always catching the steering wheel just before the vehicle
veered onto the grass. After 20 minutes, she pulled into a pebbly driveway. It
was time to find out why Vonda Wells kept going back to the emergency room.

Cox works for an agency called HealthConnect, whose purpose is to reduce
admissions to the Central Mississippi Medical Center, a Jackson hospital where
people routinely use the emergency room for primary care, sometimes multiple
times in a month.

Wells's large figure filled the door frame of the tiny house. She was jovial
despite the oxygen tube that ran to her nose. She held a baby. ''Is that
yours?'' Cox exclaimed.

''That's my grandbaby!'' Wells said and passed the baby off to a teenager who
disappeared behind a closed door. The two women sat down in a dark living room
cramped with couches.

''All right, Ms. Wells, we come out and check on everybody,'' Cox said. ''You
had pneumonia, right?''

''I went to Florida, and that's where I first got sick, at the Holy Land.''

''O.K.,'' Cox scribbled, and then looked up. ''What's that?''

''It's an amusement park out there, but it has Jerusalem, it has Noah's Ark,
they did the play the Passion . . .''

''Now there's another spot for me and my baby to go!'' Cox said. They laughed.

Cox doesn't know oak trees, but she knows how to talk to people. She knows when
to ask if someone cannot afford insulin, or is not taking insulin, or is not
keeping the insulin cold, or cannot keep the insulin cold because there is no
electricity or refrigerator. Not having health insurance is a huge problem in
Mississippi, but it isn't the only one. ''So you good with doing your
medicines?'' Wells made a guilty face. ''You oxygen-dependent?'' She was.

Wells worked at a Jackson hospital as a certified nursing assistant for five
years before she started getting sick with asthma-related illnesses. No one
wanted a nurse who needed an oxygen tank, she said, so now she was trying to
work a handful of hours a week at a Christian community center. ''I stayed in
Illinois for 25 years,'' she said. ''I didn't really have asthma symptoms till I
came down here.''

''There's something in the house that's triggering it,'' Cox said. ''I bet you
need to get tested for mold.'' She made a note. The house was old, the rug
thick, the air damp. ''And I'm putting a little check mark down here that you
got the basic light, gas and water. Your major problem is the asthma.''

''And congestive heart failure.''

Cox tilted her head. ''Have you been taught how to manage your congestive heart
failure? Because you should have a scale.'' She looked around the house gamely,
as if she believed a scale might pop out from behind the TV.

''I need a scale?''

''You need a scale, and you need to do a weight every morning. Because if you
get on a scale and there's a three-pound difference from one day to the next,
you're starting to retain fluid. I see that your legs are already swollen.''

Cox explained why people retain fluid. She then asked whether Wells had checked
her blood pressure; her emergency-room chart indicated it had been 212 over 100,
which is stroke level. Concerned about Wells's sodium intake, she asked her how
many sodas she was drinking, and told her that some juice has a lot of sodium in
it too. ''Knowledge is power, O.K.?'' Cox said gently. ''Cause you're 40, and
you're oxygen-dependent. We don't want you goin' on a date with an oxygen
tank!'' Wells laughed again.

Cox said she would try to find a company that would test the house for toxins,
and she made an appointment for Wells to visit a medical clinic that
HealthConnect operates. Wells got up, the oxygen tube dragging behind her, and
walked Cox to the door. Cox paused at one of the photographs on the wall. ''You
got a beautiful family!'' Cox said. She focused on a slim woman. ''Now, is that
Mama?''

''That's Grandma,'' Wells said. ''She was 95 when she passed. I moved down here
to help her out.''

One of the people responsible for HealthConnect's holistic, intensely personal
approach is Dr. Aaron Shirley, who three years ago found inspiration for health
care reform in an unlikely place: the primary health care system created in the
1980s in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main issue in Iran back then was
''disparities in health between its urban and rural populations,'' he told me
recently. ''In the U.S., these disparities exist. The Iranian model eliminated
the geographic disparities, so why couldn't this same approach be used for
racial and geographic disparities in the U.S.?''

Shirley created HealthConnect in 2010 because -- and, in part, to prove to
others that -- poor people in Mississippi still have health problems, even if
they have Medicaid or health insurance, even if there are clinics in their
communities, even if they get home health services. They don't get better, and
the diseases born of poverty and obesity are not prevented; thousands of people
frequent emergency rooms for illnesses that could have been tackled by primary
care. They need something more.

Shirley is a civil rights-era hero who for a long time was the only black
pediatrician in the state, the type of activist who, he says, wasn't necessarily
of the ''nonviolent persuasion'' and who, upon hearing that the local Klan was
headed to his home, would warn the Police Department that both his boys knew how
to shoot. He was the first black resident at the University of Mississippi
Medical Center and, in the 1960s, worked at the state's first community health
center, in the Mississippi Delta. He did things that don't end up in history
books, too, like build wells for poor blacks when they didn't have clean
drinking water and travel through the countryside treating malnourished babies.
In 1993, the MacArthur Foundation identified him as a ''health care leader''
when it gave him one of its ''genius'' awards.

Shirley, now 79, spends his days at the Jackson Medical Mall. For decades, the
site was an actual mall, with a JC Penney and a Gayfers, but the area around it
began to decline in the 1980s as middle-class families fled to suburbs nearby.
Historic downtown Jackson emptied out altogether, and today Capitol Street, the
bustling shopping avenue that Medgar Evers boycotted in 1962, looks shuttered
and ghostly. The mall, just five minutes from downtown, was well on its way to
the same fate, so in the mid-1990s Shirley and others created the Jackson
Medical Mall Foundation to buy it and turn it into a center offering various
health services for the poor.

Since then, Shirley has observed up close what so many Mississippians point out:
millions of dollars pour into the state every year -- both public and private
funds -- but the lives of Mississippians do not improve. ''I've been coming here
for 40 years,'' he told me recently, referring to the Mississippi Delta, ''and
nothing has changed.''

In 2008, Shirley was introduced to a consultant named James Miller by a public
health professor at Jackson State University, Mohammad Shahbazi. Miller and his
wife live in Oxford, Miss., where they and other family members run a consulting
firm and other businesses. In 2004, Miller learned about Iran's primary-care
health system during a meeting in Germany with a delegation from the Iranian
government. But it wasn't until 2007, when a struggling hospital hired Miller's
firm to conduct an assessment of its operations, that Miller fully grasped the
extent of Mississippi's health care crisis -- and recognized how much it
resembled prerevolutionary Iran.

''When the Iranian system was developed in the 1980s, there were no doctors in
rural Iran,'' Miller says. ''And this is similar to the problem in the delta
today.''

The Iranian reforms were relatively inexpensive to implement there. It was the
early '80s, just after the Ayatollah Khomeini's return and the Iranian
revolution, which had promised the country's rural villagers the kind of social
justice that had been lacking under the shah. At the time, more than half the
population lived outside major cities, in or around more than 60,000 villages.
The Iranians built ''health houses'' to minister to 1,500 people who lived
within at most an hour's walking distance. Each house is a 1,000-square-foot hut
equipped with examination rooms and sleeping quarters and staffed by community
health workers -- one man and one or more women who have been given basic
training in preventive health care. They advise on nutrition and family
planning, take blood pressure, keep track of who needs prenatal care, provide
immunization and monitor environmental conditions like water quality. Crucially,
in order to gain trust, the health workers come from the villages they serve.

People who become very sick, or require surgical procedures, are referred up
through a single, multitiered system: from health house to rural health center
to district hospital. The integrated nature of the system is what makes it
unique. Today, 17,000 health houses serve 23 million rural Iranians. Health
disparities between rural and urban Iranians have narrowed; the Iranians have
reduced rural infant mortality by 75 percent and lowered the birthrate. Iran's
reforms won praise from the World Health Organization, which has long advocated
preventive, primary care.

To Miller, the model's great appeal was its simplicity. He approached several
academic institutions in Mississippi and told them what he'd learned. Most
people looked at him as if he were nuts. The United States and Iran haven't been
on good terms since the hostage crisis in 1979. It is not a country Americans
tend to think of collaborating with. But Miller, who loves Persian history and
doesn't disguise his desire to see the United States and Iran mend their fences,
spoke to Gail Harrison, a public-health professor at U.C.L.A. She suggested he
call a former student of hers: Mohammad Shahbazi, who was not only Iranian but
also a professor at Jackson State University, a historically black college right
in Mississippi.

Shahbazi moved to the United States in the 1980s for graduate work in cultural
anthropology and became fascinated by its health care problems. He recognized
the similarities between the conditions in Mississippi and those in Iran, where
he grew up as a member of a nomadic tribe, the Qashqai, that was discriminated
against under the shah. ''We were considered the wild, smelly nomads,'' he says.
He decided that Mississippi offered the best opportunity for his work on social
determinants of health, and settled into a between-worlds existence in Jackson,
where he is neither black nor white but privy to racial slights and resentments
from both sides. ''I consider myself bleached black,'' he says.

After joining Jackson State's public health program, he often wanted to discuss
Iran's health care reforms in wider policy circles, but feared doing so in the
post-9/11 climate. Shahbazi, who is animated and friendly and tends to make
jokes like ''we don't have pharmacologists, we have harm/acologists,'' was once
pulled aside by a federal agent at an airport because he thought Shahbazi was on
a most-wanted terrorist list. When the agent showed Shahbazi the list, Shahbazi
exclaimed, ''But I am not Shabaz Mohammad of Pakistan, I am Mohammad Shahbazi of
Iran!''

Shahbazi suggested that he and Miller approach Shirley. He arranged for the two
men to visit Shiraz, Iran, and meet some of the people responsible for creating
and administering the country's health houses. The two groups decided to
establish an official academic partnership between Shiraz University and Jackson
State, and Shirley returned to Mississippi a convert. Later that year, several
Iranian doctors and administrators and their wives made their own trip to
Mississippi. They were surprised by what they saw: ''This is America?'' they
asked. In 2010, the Iranians returned for a month, calculating how many health
houses Mississippi would need, as they had done in Iran. Shahbazi began work on
a program at Jackson State for the training of community health workers. Using
resources from the Medical Mall Foundation, Shirley started HealthConnect to
show how interventionist, door-to-door community health workers might save
hospitals money and began the process of putting health houses in Jackson
schools. Eventually they hope to build the Mississippi Community Health House
Network, a pilot version of their project, in the Mississippi Delta.

''We are not saying just trust us,'' Shahbazi says. ''We are saying give us $10
to $20 million and three years; we'll implement 15 health houses in the delta,
and we will prove two things: We will show you that we are changing the health
outcomes, and we will show we can reduce the cost of health care in the state.''

Mississippi has some of the worst health statistics in the country. A
Mississippi black man's life expectancy is lower than the average American's
life expectancy was in 1960. Sixty-nine percent of adult Mississippians are
obese or overweight, and a quarter of the state's households don't have access
to decent, healthful food. Adequate grocery stores can be 30 miles away. In one
of the country's most fertile regions, people sometimes have to shop for their
groceries at the gas station. Consequently, Mississippians are dying from
diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure and asthma. Shirley points out
that in the 1960s people starved, and today they die from food.

The state has the highest rate of teen births in the nation. Currently there is
one abortion clinic in Mississippi, and Gov. Phil Bryant, a former deputy
sheriff, is working hard to render it inoperable. Until this year, schools
taught abstinence. In the United States, the black infant mortality rate is more
than twice that of white infants, so Mississippi, which is 37 percent black, has
huge neonatal intensive care units. Caring for the thousands of premature babies
(weighing between one and four pounds) costs millions of dollars. According to
Dr. Glen Graves of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, these tiny,
deprived babies grow up to be plagued with chronic illnesses.

Human Rights Watch calls the Deep South ''the epicenter of the H.I.V. epidemic
in the United States, with more people living and dying of AIDS than in any
region in the country.'' Blacks in Mississippi are dying from AIDS at a rate 64
percent higher than the nation's average. In the delta, which stretches north
and west of Jackson and is home to 560,000 people, H.I.V./AIDS is an immense but
silent crisis. The state Department of Health estimates that half of
H.I.V.-positive Mississippians currently don't receive treatment.

Many delta hospitals complain that their emergency rooms are overrun with
nonpaying patients. Dr. James Keeton, the vice chancellor for health affairs at
the University of Mississippi Medical Center, says that 14 percent of the
center's patients are uninsured, or ''self-pay,'' and the hospital recovers only
a small part of what they owe. ''Now, I say to you as a businessperson: How
would you like to work at an auto company and give away . . . cars before even
opening your doors?''

Of the state's population of nearly three million, 550,000 are uninsured. At the
moment, Governor Bryant is claiming that the state might not accept federal
money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But even if it does,
there won't be enough doctors to see all the Mississippians who need them; the
state has 176 doctors per 100,000 people, the lowest such number in the country.

Sixty years ago, Mississippi, the country's poorest and most racially divided
state, was ''the standard by which this nation's commitment to social justice
would be measured,'' the historian John Dittmer wrote. Talk to those in
Mississippi's health care community, and they all whisper the same thing: It's
not rocket science; we all know what needs to be done. In short, as one
Mississippian put it to me, ''hand-to-hand combat'' -- hiring folks whose sole
job is to ameliorate the problems in poor people's lives -- and a tremendous
amount of money could change the situation. But the political will does not
exist. So the status quo endures: generations of people who can't afford fresh
tomatoes, and who don't understand that when a doctor says take this pill three
times a day, he doesn't mean all at once.

In May, Shirley, Shahbazi and a black pediatrician named Eva Henderson-Camara
piled into Shahbazi's car and headed to the delta to talk to two nurses at a
small hospital in Belzoni, more than an hour north of Jackson. The first thing
you notice on entering the delta, especially when you're expecting to find
poverty, is that you don't see many people. The farms are vast and empty. So
much of the area is bucolic and sun-dappled that it doesn't seem poor. When I
said as much to Claudia Cox about Mississippi in general, she replied sternly:
''That's because poverty in America doesn't look like what y'all think. It used
to be bare feet, now it's Nikes. If I miss two months of work because I get
sick, well, guess what? I'm in poverty. This is the new poverty.'' Yet in delta
towns like Louise and Midnight, the poverty is impossible to miss: desolate
commercial streets in the shadow of a rotting mill, shotgun houses wilting on
one side of railroad tracks, houses almost buried under possessions on the porch
and in the yard.

Henderson-Camara, now 60, grew up on the plantation her grandfather owned.
Children at the time worked much of the school year as part of the sharecropper
system, which lasted until the '70s, as corporations bought and mechanized the
farms. (''Imagine waking up every morning and this is all you see,''
Henderson-Camara said, looking out the window at the flat fields stretching to
the sky. ''And you think, Should I shoot myself now or later?'') Thousands of
displaced workers found jobs at the Jockey factory, or the Schwinn plant, or on
catfish farms, but those shut down in the early '90s. Henderson-Camara got out
by winning a scholarship for a fifth year of high school at Yale. Today she
lives in Jackson and works in HealthConnect's medical clinic.

In Belzoni, everyone sat down at a rectangular table, and the director of
nursing, Dee Ann Brown, recounted the hospital's troubles: emergency-room
readmissions, obesity, inadequate insurance. Shirley then explained the role of
community health workers and asked Brown if she thought that service might be
helpful.

''What you are describing is home health, isn't it?'' Brown said.

Home-health agencies dispatch nurses to do clinical work in patients' homes. But
they are not obligated to take your phone calls at midnight or steer you away
from eating fried food -- and you have to have insurance to get their care.
Often for-profit services, they are also the hedge funds of the health care
community: potentially lucrative, largely unregulated, producing bad results as
often as good. Sanjay Basu, a physician and policy expert at the University of
California, San Francisco, says that while he has seen some remarkable and
devoted home-health agencies, ''if you're in it for a buck, you could have a
terrible home agency and make a ton of money.'' Many towns in the delta have
them -- yet the delta's problems persist. Why? Shirley offered that the
hospitals need a third party trained to discern what exactly will help a
patient, and that party must come from the patient's world: talk the same, share
similar fears and frustrations and life experiences.

''Most home-health nurses build great relationships with their patients,'' Brown
said.

''But there's a lot of distrust,'' Henderson-Camara said, leaning forward. ''We
don't trust people who don't look like us. Having grown up in a very segregated
community, I know this for a fact. You may think that you're in with that
patient, but when you walk out that door, they will laugh and say, 'I just told
her that so she'll stop asking me questions.' But if you live in that community
and sister Edna tells you something, you say, 'Now, Edna,' and she will say,
'O.K., you got me.' And she'll tell you the truth. People do not trust people
who do not look like them.''

''I don't feel that's a problem here,'' said Brown, who happens to be white. ''I
may be way smoozed.''

''I think you're smoozed.''

The friction between them highlighted a problem beyond a distrust of outsiders:
the fractured nature of American health care. It was easy to dismiss, or
misconstrue, the health-house network as just another addition to a market
glutted with for-profit businesses and nonprofit services looking to patch up
the holes in -- or take advantage of -- the health care system. What Shirley and
his colleagues saw the need for was something holistic and aggressive that would
take root in the community, get into homes and alter the course of future
generations, before obesity, say, or diabetes sets in. The Iranian system they
admire is a preventive health care system. American health care is not
preventive, and it's not a system.

The practice of community health workers going door to door has been applied
everywhere from China to Mexico. According to Carl H. Rush of the University of
Texas Institute of Health Policy, in the United States, community health workers
have been used on a small scale for decades. More recently, he says, hospitals
around the country are realizing the potential for community health workers to
lower their costs.

The Iranian health houses, too, resemble the original mission of America's
community health centers. When Dr. H. Jack Geiger founded the country's first
federally qualified health center in 1967 in Mound Bayou, a small town in the
delta, the goal was to confront the many aspects of people's lives that were
contributing to their ill health. ''We built wells and privies and housing and
started a 500-acre vegetable farm,'' says Geiger, whose work was inspired by
what he saw in South Africa in the late '50s, ''and that probably had a bigger
impact on the health of the population than what we were doing as doctors. The
indigenous people we trained were among the most useful people on staff.''

Today there are 8,300 centers serving 20 million people throughout the country.
Over the years, however, community health centers, needing to compete in the
marketplace, have evolved into more conventional medical businesses, focused on
the delivery of personal health services rather than the social and
environmental determinants of overall health.

To help them return to the original mission, the Affordable Care Act will give
$11 billion to community health centers, a sum that will double the numbers and
capacity of centers nationwide. ''It would be effective if community health
centers were given the budget to return to the interventions that characterized
almost all of the first health centers of the 1960s and 1970s,'' Geiger says.
''Every health care provider in this country is under pressure, because of the
incentives in the system, to churn out patients as fast as you can, because you
get paid for visits. That just doesn't work for people with the kind of complex
problems you probably saw in Mississippi. You can't fix these problems in 10
minutes.''

Shirley says he believes that the problems of the American poor -- living
conditions, deficient education, harmful behaviors and the lack of family
support and access to healthful lifestyles -- demand house calls. This approach
was used by groups in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J., profiled by Atul Gawande
in The New Yorker last year, which identified the worst offenders of
emergency-room readmission and deployed social workers and nurses to figure out
the myriad sources of ill health. What was clear above all else from Gawande's
account is that what these people needed was constant attention. Because one
stumble -- an unpaid electricity bill, for example -- can lead to cascading
health setbacks.

The Iranian model goes a step further by making the community health workers
responsible for their villagers' well-being from birth. It's an approach very
much at odds with the American ethos of self-reliance. But in Iran, the seeming
intrusiveness is required, according to Dr. Kamel Shadpour, one of the
architects of the Iranian system. ''If you go to one of these community health
workers and ask him or her how many people they cover, they won't tell you
around 2,000,'' Shadpour says. ''They will tell you exactly 1,829 people. If you
take out the family file with the No. 62, he or she will know which family that
is, and she will tell you that the father is this old, and they have five
children, their ages, their vaccinations, how they were doing family planning,
everything.''

The Iranian model also differs from many others because of its integrated
delivery network: the way a patient is referred up through a chain of hospitals
according to their needs. ''The overall system is the key,'' says Miller, the
Oxford consultant, ''not just community health workers.''

The American government has been moving toward more comprehensive solutions. The
Affordable Care Act has created ''accountable care organizations'' that include
doctors, social workers, nurses and pharmacists working together to serve
patients. Since May, also as part of health care reform, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services announced more than 100 multimillion-dollar
grants to organizations that proposed new ways to prevent illness and save
money. Its Innovation Center awarded grants to a large number of experimental
programs that involve community health workers.

''There's a renewed interest in them, in part because of the nation's increased
focus on prevention,'' says Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, the director of the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. ''Eighty-four percent of our health care
dollar is spent on managing people with chronic conditions. . . . We know
preventing obesity can help prevent other illnesses such as diabetes,
hypertension and kidney disease -- so how can we prevent these conditions from
occurring in the first place? Likely not with more procedures and X-rays. Some
of the winners' programs harken back to the way health care was delivered long
ago. The things we learn by going into someone's home tell us so much about the
patient's life and how they manage their own diseases.''

One morning last spring, Shirley took me to see one of his new health-house
facilities at Blackburn Middle School, which is on the edge of Jackson State
University's campus and across the street from where Shirley grew up. Walking
with him through the neighborhood, or stopping in with him at the Penguin, a
nice restaurant on the Jackson State campus, is like being with the mayor. Over
lunch, the people who came to shake his hand included the state's new director
of Medicaid and the president of the Mississippi NAACP.

Shirley reasoned that opening health houses in the schools was a natural way to
gain access to families. Many public schools in Mississippi don't have full-time
nurses, and Blackburn Middle School is attended almost entirely by students who
live in poverty, so it welcomed the chance to have health care on the premises.

One community health worker on the staff at Blackburn was Tiara, a single mother
on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families I first met almost nine months
earlier. A not-so-obvious benefit of training community health workers is that
doing so creates jobs for unemployed people; advanced degrees are unnecessary.
In our first interview, Tiara told me how much she loved her job. At Blackburn,
she seemed quieter as we talked about how she counseled young girls about sex.
''As someone who had a child at 17, I am so against it,'' she told us. (She is
now 22.) ''You have so much potential.''

As a HealthConnect employee, Tiara also made house calls before being
transferred to work in the school. Her life is a kind of full-time HealthConnect
anyway. ''I had'' -- she said, counting -- ''six people in my apartment last
night. Because they don't have electricity. And one was a real bad diabetic who
can't see how to pull her insulin, can't see anything.''

These are the sorts of stories you hear repeatedly in Mississippi. During five
days driving around with Cox, I saw what health workers were up against, and
what they were capable of. Cox comes from a middle-class family, the product of
a stable home. She went to college, became a funeral director and then decided
to go to nursing school, using public assistance to make her way through it. Cox
had worked as a nurse for 20 years -- Shirley and the Central Mississippi
Medical Center decided to use licensed nurses at HealthConnect until their
community health workers are trained -- and she could intuit that a patient's
life might be crumbling in surprising ways.

There was Regina Huggins, who had been in the hospital 20 times in eight months
since her heart attack. She was a smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who lacked energy and had lost 50 pounds. One of the reasons she kept
calling ambulances to go to the E.R. seemed to be that she had no
transportation; she couldn't even afford a taxi. She did not qualify for
Medicaid. Without insurance, she couldn't get an oxygen tank or inhalers or fill
her prescriptions. She had $300,000 in medical bills.

There was Mamie Marshall, who was dying of bone cancer in the back room of her
house. None of her doctors had put her in hospice care, and she said she had
been told that no one could do anything for her. She was a licensed beautician
and had worked for Packard Electric, a subsidiary of General Motors, and as a
public-school bus driver and as a nanny. ''I worked,'' she said.

And there were Carolyn Brewster and Melvin McGee, 29-year-olds whose baby,
Justin, was born prematurely, most likely because Brewster had high blood
pressure and pre-eclampsia. Both Brewster and McGee have learning disabilities,
but they had jobs and had earnestly embraced parenthood, paying $450 a month for
a two-room apartment in a motel-like apartment complex where everyone seemed to
be under 30. When we called on them, Cox decided to take Brewster's blood
pressure and discovered that it was 149 over 100. Brewster wasn't doing anything
to reduce it except taking vinegar, a common home remedy. Cox made an
appointment for her at the medical clinic later that day, told her how to catch
the bus and which pharmacy to go to and emphasized that she needed to go right
away. ''You are only 29, and you are going to end up on dialysis,'' she said.

On our way out, Cox said she wanted to stop by to see Tiara, who lives in the
same apartment complex. She had just had her second child.

Shirley, Shahbazi and Miller haven't had an easy time getting large-scale
financing for their health-house network. They enlisted a Mississippi
congressman, Bennie Thompson, to write a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, the
secretary of Health and Human Services. They applied for (but did not receive)
one of those grants awarded by the Innovation Center; Jack Geiger wrote the
recommendation letter. They talked it up in Mississippi.

The three men -- and many Mississippians I spoke to -- complain that a lot of
federal and grant money goes to research, not actual services. ''The delta
people have been studied to death,'' Shirley says. Also, as they point out,
funding rarely goes to entire systems. But the group is hoping that the idea of
Iranian-style health houses in the United States might inspire good will between
the two countries.

''If they can get the resources, then why not give it a try?'' said Shadpour,
the architect of the Iranian system, when I called him in Tehran. ''The
situation is not worse than Iran. To the contrary, it is much better in many
ways. The infrastructure is there.''

Until someone finances the pilot for 15 health houses, Shirley will establish
them in 11 schools -- where there are already rooms, electricity, water. To keep
the houses running, Shirley says, they are staffed with certified nurse
practitioners whose services can be billed to Medicaid. ''So the revenue that
the nurse generates will go to paying her and the community health workers, too.
We say, 'O.K., how much money is already out there?'

''The only outside money that we've gotten to contribute to our project has been
$75,000 from United Healthcare, the insurance company, because they see the
potential to save them money,'' he continued.

His methods are scrappy and scattershot, but Shirley is used to working around
the system. After 60 years, perhaps the main reason he's turning to an Iranian
model is because, unlike everything else in Mississippi, it worked. In one year,
HealthConnect cut the rate of readmissions to the Central Mississippi Medical
Center by 15 percent.

Meanwhile, Miller is trying to find yet another way to generate money. With
support from Jackson State doctors and advice from their counterparts at Shiraz
University, he has begun discussing the idea of Americans and Iranians working
together to implement the Iranian model in other needy countries. He hopes that
a major international aid project might be a way to get financing for
Mississippi.

A few weeks after her first visit, Claudia Cox returned to Vonda Wells's house.
Wells, who is now 41, hadn't returned to the emergency room, but she seemed
sadder. She hadn't been paid the $5 a day she was supposed to get for working at
the Christian community center, but despite doing all her paperwork and leaving
messages for her caseworker, she had not heard back.

And because Medicaid limits the number of doctor visits in a year, she couldn't
see one now.

''How you going to follow up with your pulmonologist and cardiologist?'' Cox
asked.

''I had to cancel,'' Wells said. ''I already have a bill in there for $240 I
have to pay.''

She couldn't keep up with her medicines. ''Medicaid can't pay for it, and I
can't pay for the medicines, not at $90 a pop,'' she said. ''I try to wean
myself off of medicine. If I feel good, I don't take them.''

But Wells spoke of positive things. Her 19-year-old daughter, who played in the
next room with Wells's grandchild, was talented enough to be a fashion designer,
she said. Her youngest daughter, 16, wanted to join the military ''to see the
world.'' Her mother helped out with the bills at times. And her uncle had
offered to come by and do some repairs, rip up the carpet, fix the kitchen. In
many ways, Wells was rare among Cox's patients: she still had family.

In fact, the house had been her grandmother's, and she had spent some of her
childhood there. She was lucky to have a rent-free home full of so many
memories. But Wells would have to wait to learn whether that house was giving
her asthma problems.

''We couldn't find anybody to examine the house'' that was affordable, Cox said.
''It was $1,300 for one day -- just to test. Just to come out here and pull a
couple of pieces from the attic.''

'Integrated Delta' is not welcomed by all

BYLINE: Chloe Lai

The word "integration" has rarely been far from the lips of Guangdong officials
as they seek to shape the future of the Pearl River Delta. The theory is quite
simple: if the nine major cities share services, infrastructure and people,
development will be more even and focused. But what that  means in reality is
far from clear.

There are many places being integrated beyond the broader meshing of Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Dongguan, Zhongshan, Huizhou and Zhaoqing .

Shenzhen's blueprint sets out its complementary role to Hong Kong, albeit as the
mainland city transforms into a "global centre for trade, logistics, innovation
and cultural industries".

The most advanced integration is between Guangzhou and Foshan, where efforts are
so far along that the mega-city has a name, Guangfo.

With an urban population of a little more than 1.1 million people, Foshan has
long been overshadowed by its larger neighbour   15 kilometres away. As both
cities have sprawled, Foshan has begun to resemble a suburb of Guangzhou. This
year, officials from the  cities unveiled 52 projects that would bind them
closer together. They range  from massive infrastructure projects to eliminating
phone roaming charges.

In recent months a new expressway opened connecting Foshan to Guangzhou's Baiyun
airport, cutting journey time from more than an hour to around 30 minutes. Next
comes the Guangfo Metro line - a 33 kilometre branch with 21  stops due  for
completion in phases between next year and 2012.

In health care, medical records will be shared and insurance will be
co-ordinated. Foshan residents will be able to receive Guangzhou's local
television channels and vice versa, while public security bureaus will share
information on migrant worker populations.

The most original plan is for improved shopping, with Guangzhou's   shopping
centres selling  wares in Foshan.

The backing for this type of integration comes  from the top. Guangdong party
chief Wang Yang hailed it as a cornerstone in transforming the Delta into a
"mega-city". The idea of making the Delta a "world class metropolis" received
Beijing's blessing in January.

On the ground in Guangzhou, however, there is a marked indifference to the
plans.

"It is a government thing, I don't see how it is related to us," said college
student Terrence He, 22. "I don't usually go to Foshan. If I go, it is to eat
there and come back."

He had visited Hong Kong at least 20 times - far more times than he has been to
Foshan. "I would  be more excited if they worked on Guangzhou-Hong Kong
integration," he said.

But among residents of Foshan  there is more enthusiasm for the plans, which
they believe will grant them improved access to Guangzhou's superior facilities.

"I know most of the Guangzhou people are not keen on the integration but the
people of Foshan think differently," said Elaine Wu, a  professional who lives
in Guangzhou during the week and Foshan at the weekend.

"[Foshan residents] always visit Guangzhou, not only to meet relatives but also
to shop and for fun. We welcome any efforts  that will make our journey easier.

"It is important for us because Guangzhou has more resources than Foshan. If we
can share Guangzhou's resources, it will enhance our quality of life."

Qiu Shan, an economist  at Guangdong's Academy of Social Sciences, said the
government would have to do more promotion if it wanted to sell the idea of
broader Pearl River Delta integration. "It is natural that the people of
Guangzhou aren't too excited by it all. It is because they don't see how they
will benefit," he said.

Brace for tax hikes, mayors warn: Triggered by municipal cuts, the inaugural
speeches of Lower Mainland mayors were laced with condemnation of the NDP.

BYLINE: VANCOUVER SUN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 1347 words


In inaugural speeches around the region Monday, many Greater Vancouver mayors
warned residents to brace for service cuts and tax increases as municipalities
try to absorb millions in provincial government cutbacks.

The speeches of mayors from Vancouver to Langley, following the swearing in of
newly elected councils, were laced with condemnation of the New Democratic Party
government in Victoria.

Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen said that because the province cut the city's grants
last week by $ 17.2 million, there will have to be tax hikes. Council will be
unable to keep property taxes below the inflation rate as it has for the past 10
years, he warned.

But he said there will be extensive consultation with the public on how to
manage the loss -- whether it should be mostly a tax increase, mostly a service
cut or some combination of the two. Owen pointed out that the lost grants are
equivalent to 60 per cent of the library budget or 180 police officers.

Beside dealing with revenue cuts, the city is creating a new licensing
commission that will deal with problem businesses in the city, particularly
those on the Downtown Eastside, which has had increasing difficulties with bars,
pawnshops, massage parlors and establishments that are havens for drug-dealing.

The city will also be replacing the traffic commission with a new transportation
and traffic committee, to be headed by Councillor Gordon Price, a passionate
advocate of better public transit and bikeways in the city.

Owen also announced he will hold regular council sessions outside city hall. He
didn't specifically say the meetings were to ensure the public can stay in touch
with a council consisting entirely of Non-Partisan Association councillors, but
he did refer to council's responsibility to be "fully representative" and "more
inclusive."

In Surrey, Mayor Doug McCallum said provincial cuts and the offloading of
responsibility for maintaining certain highways on to city taxpayers will be
costly. But in his first term as mayor, he plans to go ahead with the three-year
tax freeze he promised during last month's civic election campaign.

"Surrey city hall -- like the thousands of families in Surrey -- must learn to
live within its means," he said. "That means learning to do more with less."

McCallum spoke of his vision for King George Highway, now a ribbon of neon signs
and shopping malls, as a beautiful boulevard -- a gateway to the city.

And armed with a council majority, he promised a more cooperative mood in
council chambers than in recent years.

"We will not always agree in decision making -- indeed we may frequently
disagree -- and that is healthy debate," he said of the new Surrey Electors
Team-dominated council. "But we must do so without personal attacks, keeping in
mind that our common goal is the betterment of Surrey -- hard on issues and soft
on the people."

Richmond Mayor Greg Halsey-Brandt said the greatest challenge facing the city
are the "financial constraints and cutbacks being forced upon us by
cash-strapped higher levels of government."

Cuts in provincial grants have cost Richmond $ 3.7 million this year and the
mayor said council and staff must find ways to make up the shortfall without
burdening taxpayers with additional taxes.

Also, the provincial government's recent decision to amalgamate a number of
health districts is cause for concern to Richmond.

Effective today, Richmond's boundary was extended westward, enclosing the Iona
Island jetty, the Steveston jetty and 8,900 hectares of foreshore lying between
the north and south arms of the Fraser River.

The change reduces the size of the University of B.C. Endowment Lands.
Halsey-Brandt said the move was the logical way to control land use and the
provision of services to the area.

Delta Mayor Beth Johnson used her inaugural address to promote a public campaign
to convince the provincial government to complete Nordel Way.

The government had promised to finish Nordel Way in order to link Highway 91 and
the Alex Fraser Bridge with Scott Road, but the road runs only partway there.

"We as a community, government, business and private citizenry must launch a
major campaign to persuade the provincial government to live up to its
commitments," she said.

Johnson made only a brief direct reference to the often-bitter dispute between
the municipality and the Tsawwassen First Nation concerning the development of
band property for housing.

"We will ask citizens for guidance in regards to negotiations with the
Tsawwassen First Nation."

New Westminster Mayor Helen Sparkes said cuts to municipal grants combined with
new responsibilities for provincial highways and recent legislative changes that
exempt railways from municipal taxation make the next three years extremely
challenging.

"All of these changes by the province certainly will affect and impact on our
finances and our ability to provide quality services to our citizens," Sparkes
said.

Coquitlam Mayor Lou Sekora said his city must look at sharing more services with
surrounding municipalities to soften the blow of provincial cuts.

Sekora, who begins his seventh term as mayor, said he hopes to be able to keep
next year's property tax increase to a "reasonable level."

He bemoaned the province's reluctance to deliver a promised light-rapid transit
line to Coquitlam, a frequent complaint of his over the years.

"I believe we should slow the rate of growth until we get some real commitments
from Victoria," he said.

White Rock Mayor Hardy Staub described last week's cuts to municipal grants as
"an act of fiscal piracy" that could lead to the elimination of city programs.
"With fewer dollars, we may not be able to continue to provide everything we do
now, and the quality of our service to the public will inevitably suffer," he
said.

Staub joked that now that the Nov. 16 civic elections are over, "we can return
to watching senior levels of government do what they do best, creating problems
and emergencies for us to solve."

Staub appointed an economic development committee Monday night to work to
revitalize a depressed town centre. The committee will develop a marketing plan
for the city.

North Vancouver city Mayor Jack Loucks said the next three years will be the
most important in the city's history.

He cited plans to develop three major sites--Lower Lonsdale, Versatile Shipyards
and the Fullerton lands.

He said the city will try not to increase taxes as a result of the province's
reduction in grants. He said he has told staff to develop options for dealing
with the cuts.

"This does not mean that every department, board and agency can continue to
expect the same level of funding, nor that capital programs will not be
deferred.

"I have every confidence, however, that we can develop revenues from other
sources and will re-examine all non-essential items."

QUOTES FROM THE INAUGURAL SPEECHES OF LOWER MAINLAND MAYORS

"I propose to put our financial dilemmas squarely before Vancouver residents."

Philip Owen

Vancouver

"I intend to ensure that consensus -- not conflict -- become the new yardstick
by which our council is measured."

Doug McCallum

Surrey

"Our residents have enjoyed one of the lowest tax rates in the region, but
recent cuts in government grants and rising costs present a real challenge..."

Lou Sekora

Coquitlam

"Several hotels are slated for construction in the next few years. Hotel guests
spent $ 80 million in Richmond last year."

Greg Halsey-brandt

Richmond

"The challenges ahead are clear ... traffic continues to top the list and Nordel
Way completion is the number one priority."

Beth Johnson

Delta

"If we don't have enough money to meet expenses, then, just as in a family
budget or in a business enterprise, we must reduce our expectations."

Hardy Staub

White Rock

"Municipal governments are, unfortunately, an attractive target for senior
levels of government, as we have enviable and solvent balance sheets."

Clara Oshiomhole Sunset on a Comrade's Backbone [analysis]

BYLINE: Patrick Ochoga

LENGTH: 1037  words

DATELINE: Benin City


Dark cloud enveloped Edo State on December 7, 2010 at exactly 10: 53pm when the
shocking news of the death of Mrs Clara Oshiomhole was announced by the state
government. The entire state capital was thrown into morning as activities
around Osadebey Avenue, the seat of power came to a halt. Sympathisers besieged
Comrade Adams Oshiomhole's official residence to commiserate with the Labour
hero.

Mrs Oshiomhole may not have the crowd pulling charisma of her husband, the pace
setting executive governor of Edo State, but on her own the first lady was a
force to reckon with.

Born June 18, 1956 to the Akharaggbon family of Idumu-Agbo, Okaigben, in Esan
South-East Local Government Area of Edo State, Clara never had the privilege of
acquiring early education like her mates. That, however, did not affect her
determination to acquire a professional academic relevance after which she took
up appointment as a staff of the National Institute of Public Information, an
agency of the Federal Ministry of Information, Kaduna.

She was a secretariat staff of the institute until her husband won a popular
victory to become the third democratically elected governor of Edo State.

Quiet, admirable but forceful, Mrs Oshiomhole was until her demise, the strong
tower behind her husband's uncanny doggedness and fight for the welfare of
Nigerian workers. Her contribution to the success of her husband's numerous
struggles also played a great impact to his emergence as the people's governor
and indeed, his quest to emancipate the state frm the grip of imposed
underdevelopment.

A major outcome of that fight is her setting up of the Health Foundation for
Maternal and Child Care (HEFMAC) an NGO for bringing qualitative health care to
the indigent in the state. With her NGO, she has successfully taken the free
health care programme to the three senatorial districts of the state.

As part of her determination to end the travail of women and children,
particularly the girl-child, Mrs Oshiomhole has not only given out millions of
naira in payment of hospital bills, she has equally given out scholarships to
indigent but brilliant young girls to cover tuition and books frm secondary to
tertiary institutions of learning. The girls were selected frm the three
senatorial zones of the state.

As flags were flown in half mast in all government establishments across the
state, condolences continued to pour in frm prominent dignitries, both frm
within and outside the state capital. Among early callers were Alhaji Rauf
Aregbesola, Osun State governor, Babatunde Fashola of Lagos State, Dr Chris
Ngige, former governor of Anambra State, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor
Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Bisi Akande, former governor
of Delta State , Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and the acting governor of Delta State,
Sam Obi.

Reacting to the sudden death of Mrs. Oshiomhole, the Edo State chairman of the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih described the death as a big
loss. "It is a big loss to the state and the nation, especially at this critical
time that her motherly love and support for the husband and the state is most
required. On behalf of the entire members of the PDP, Edo State, I hereby wish
to express our heartfelt condolence to the governor, his family and the good
people of Edo State.

"We pray God almighty to give her gentle soul eternal rest. We also pray God to
grant the governor the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss."

Besides, the Esogban of Benin Kingdom, David Edibiri described Mrs. Oshiomhole's
death as very sad, saying, "It pleased God to call her home when her services to
the state are most needed. She had been a very strong backbone to the governor
of the state all through his trials and travails. Now that the governor is set
to reposition and transform the state, his better half is no longer there.

"We pray that God almighty would give her a resting place in his heavenly
kingdom. I wish the comrade-governor and the entire family the courage and
fortitude to bear the irreparable loss."

In his reaction, the Edo State chairman of the Action Congress of Nigeria, Tony
Omoaghae , described her death as a shock, adding that she was a caring and
supportive mother.

An Action Congress of Nigeria House of Representatives hopeful for Oredo federal
constituency, Hon Osaretin Edosomwan in a statement, described her as a pillar
and woman that stood behind her husband in his struggle days.

While Chief John Oyegun, former governor of the state said Clara Oshiomhole's
death was a great tragedy to her husband and the state in general, he added that
she was very supportive, quiet, unassuming and courageous, saying, "We are sad
at what has happened. We all pray that God will give her husband, her children
and family the courage to bear the loss."

Edo State chapter of the ACN, yesterday described the untimely death of Mrs.
Oshiomhole as a big loss to Edo people and the country in general.

A statement by the state chairman of the Local Organising Committee, Alhaji
AbdulMalik Afegbua said, "The news of the death of Mrs. Oshiomhole is very sad
and painful. We received the news at the party secretariat with rude shock.
Death is completely unfair to Oshiomhole's wife. It's an embarrassment and
undemocratic."

Afegbua, who described her as "a simple, humble and God-fearing woman." said,
"She will certainly be missed! She was indeed a caring and loving mother and a
great source of inspiration to the governor and many of us. Those who had ever
felt the loss of a dear one will understand the sense of void and loss Comrade
Oshiomhole feels now."

Continuing, he said, "Oshiomhole has fought several battles, confronted the evil
of a stolen mandate and presently conquering the stigma of under-development in
our dear state, just as his dear wife was an able lieutenant who stood beside
him during those struggles.

"Can we question God? It is God that gives and it is God that takes. Blessed be
the name of the Lord. I pray may the Almighty Allah forgive her sins and grant
her eternal rest. Besides, may the Almighty God grant Governor Adams Oshiomhole
the fortitude to bear the loss. This is a great lesson for all of us that are
still living-one day we are going to die.

Nasr signs 4 agreements with AFD worth [#x20ac]259m

BYLINE: Hisham Salah

LENGTH: 522 words


Minister of Investment and International Cooperation Sahar Nasr signed 4
agreements with the director of operations of the Agence Française de
Développement (AFD), Laurence Breton-Moyet, which provide support for the
sectors of energy, sanitation, and healthcare--worth a total value of
[#x20ac]259m. The French ambassador to Egypt, André Parant, witnessed the
signing.

Nasr said that the finances are divided into loans and grants, explaining that
the first loan from the AFD is worth [#x20ac]175m for supporting the budget of
the energy sector.

Nasr added that the money of the loan will be received by the Ministry of
Finance, yet the electricity sector would be supported by an additional
[#x20ac]3m as a grant that would be provided to the Ministry of Electricity and
Renewable Energy to finance a technical programme.

The AFD will provide a financing package worth [#x20ac]31m for a project to
support the quality of primary healthcare service in Egypt, which is the first
of its kind by the AFD in the health and social sectors in Egypt. However, Nasr
signed an agreement that provides a [#x20ac]50m loan to support the expansion of
the East Alexandria wastewater treatment plant.

The energy loan is part of the international society's attempts to support
Egypt's budget deficit. It also represents the second support from France
announced by the French minister of finance. It will be financing the sector's
strategy until 2035, which aims at developing the energy sector (gas and
petroleum), rationalising energy consumption, diversifying the energy mix, and
guaranteeing a sustainable energy service.

The financing package of the healthcare programme is divided into a [#x20ac]30m
loan and a [#x20ac]1m grant, which was designed to improve the quality of
service for more than 700 families in the Delta and Canal regions, by providing
rehabilitation, equipment, and training.

According to the AFD, UNICEF has been requested to support the implementation of
the community mobilisation activities in order to increase health awareness and
use of primary healthcare services in the targeted areas.

Furthermore, the project of the wastewater treatment plant in Alexandria will
entail the construction of a "sludge digestion unit" connected to the existing
water treatment plant, which is the largest one in Alexandria, treating 800,000
cubic metres per day. The project is expected to start in the second half of
2017 after all contracts are finalised.

Nasr said that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the countries that
promised to support Egypt's budget deficit, explaining that the government has
already signed the deal with the UK, has now signed with France, and will be
signing with Germany soon. Additionally, Nasr is set to visit Germany on Friday
to discuss German support for Egypt.

From a different perspective, Minister of Health and Population Ahmed Emad
El-Din Rady stated that the finances would be used to develop the health units
in the Suez Canal area.

Moreover, Breton-Moyet stated that the AFD has been helping Egypt in financing
lots of projects--worth a total value of [#x20ac]341.4m, in addition to
[#x20ac]103m provided by the European Union and organised by the AFD.

CARE celebrates decade in Atlanta

BYLINE: MONI BASU

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: News; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 917 words


Villagers in remote areas of eastern India don't necessarily know the full name
of the United States of America. But some, at least, know Atlanta.

That's where the agency that saved their lives is located, people in the state
of Orissa said when massive storms washed away their meager livelihood five
years ago. In the aftermath of the Indian cyclones, CARE played a key role in
providing emergency relief to devastated areas.

Weary residents had heard of Atlanta because it is home to CARE, one of the
largest private relief and development agencies in the world.

Putting the city on the global map was an aspiration that Atlanta's architects
of internationalization hoped CARE would help fulfill. City leaders embraced the
agency's relocation here in 1993.

Then-Gov. Zell Miller said CARE would be a feather in an Olympic city's cap and
that it would "add substantially to the international prestige we enjoy."

Today, as the humanitarian agency celebrates a decade in its headquarters
downtown on Ellis Street, CARE, with its programs in 69 distant lands, may not
yet be a local household name. But Atlantans whose lives and jobs intersect with
CARE said Miller's forecast proved correct.

"It's a great credit to Atlanta that CARE calls this city home," said Charles H.
"Pete" McTier, president of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, which awarded a
grant to CARE in 1997 for work in public health. "CARE's leadership has become
part of the community fabric."

Professional visitors to Atlanta are often drawn to the city by what George
Brown, president of the Georgia Council for Visitors, calls the six C's --- CNN,
Coke, the Carter Center, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
civil rights movement and, most recently, CARE.

Stephen Blount, director of the CDC's Office of Global Health, said CARE's
presence has been "positive and profound."

"Because of their global focus, they have helped Atlanta grow up as a city,"
Blount said.

As a cost-cutting measure, CARE USA, the largest and oldest of 11 CARE national
organizations in an international confederation, moved its headquarters from New
York, where it was founded in 1945 to provide food assistance to post-World War
II Europe.

Philip Johnston, who was president of CARE in 1993, said soaring real estate
costs in New York interfered with the agency's staffing rotation and drained too
many dollars from overseas programs. Johnston said the move proved beneficial to
both his agency and its new hometown.

"The idea of a community made up of different folks with different strokes and
all of that was enhanced by CARE's presence here and the interaction of our
staff with Atlantans all the time," Johnston said. "If we had to do it all over
again, 100 percent we would."

CARE's current president and CEO, Peter Bell, said his agency had benefited from
a number of uniquely Atlanta affiliations. In accepting the Phoenix Award for
community service from Mayor Shirley Franklin recently, Bell acknowledged
relations with a long list of hometown companies and institutions that included
Delta Air Lines, the CDC, Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health,
Morehouse College, the Woodruff Foundation, SunTrust Banks and Georgia Power.

Bell said his agency had also gained visibility from being close to CNN's
studios, where CARE staffers have frequently been interviewed on a variety of
global issues.

Since 1998, Delta Air Lines, also headquartered here, has donated more than $1
million of in-kind and cash support to CARE. Paul Matsen, senior vice president
for the airline's international and alliances division, said CARE has been able
to take advantage of its location in a Delta hub, making travel easier for the
300 or so staff members based here and the field workers who visit headquarters.

Last year, Matsen, who serves on CARE's board, visited a CARE girls' education
project in rural Guatemala that Delta supports financially. He said the agency
had helped shed a different kind of light on the city.

"We tend to focus on trade and commercial and tourism opportunities," he said.
"CARE reminds us that we need to give back. It shows us that you can really make
a difference."

Matsen said Delta supports a number of charities but that CARE is a "signature"
partner mostly because it shares a hometown.

Proximity also brought CARE and the CDC together. Both agencies benefited from a
$5.1 million grant from the Woodruff Foundation, which paid for nine
collaborative health projects in Africa and Latin America that dealt with safe
drinking water, control of infectious diseases and nutritional needs of mothers
and infants.

Patricia Riley, director of the CARE-CDC Health Initiative, said getting the two
large agencies in sync wasn't easy at first and that the relationship might have
floundered if CARE's offices weren't easily accessible.

Now, long after the grant money has gone, many of the programs are continuing
with other donors, including the World Health Organization.

Bell said he hopes more Atlantans will find a way to plug into CARE in the
future. So does Leanne Rubenstein, a social services manager from Decatur, who
said volunteering with CARE was a life-changing experience.

Rubenstein taught English, worked in an orphanage and helped implement a
microcredit lending program in Ayacucho, Peru.

"They had great appreciation for the smallest things," she said. "It really
brought home to me how much we take things for granted."

Sen. Cochran, R-Mississippi, withholding support of 2012 Farm Bill

BYLINE: MBJ Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 461  words


Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) says he is disappointed with the 2012 Farm Bill
approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee and is withholding his support for
the measure due to inadequate coverage for important crops produced in
Mississippi.

Cochran, who serves on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee
and is a former chairman of the panel, was among five senators who voted against
adopting the 2012 Farm Bill, preferring to allow the committee to resolve
problematic provisions that would adversely affect cotton, rice, peanuts and
other crops. The bill passed on a 16-5 vote.

"It is difficult for me to withhold support for a Farm Bill, but I cannot
support this bill," Cochran said. "I think we have much more work to do before
we reach a consensus on a farm support bill that can be approved by a majority
of the Senate. I hope we have an opportunity to offer amendments that have a
chance of strengthening the bill, particularly as it relates to Southern
interests. Specifically, cotton, rice and peanuts need more of a break than what
they have received in this bill. "

Cochran said the chairman's mark approved by the committee is problematic
because it would repeal all current commodity support programs and institute a
single revenue program that does not provide equal coverage for all crops. For
example, baseline funding for rice production is decreased by roughly 70
percent, a significantly disproportionate reduction compared to many other
commodities. Rice and peanut production would effectively be left without a
reasonable form of price protections.

Cochran noted that the 2012 Farm Bill includes his amendment to reauthorize a
competitive rural health care services grant program for the Mississippi River
Delta. Initially created in the 2008 Farm Bill, the program is designed to
address health needs by supporting health care services, education, job training
and public health-related facilities. The Cochran amendment would authorize an
annual $3.0 million appropriation for FY2013 through FY2017.

The senator also supported inclusion of a crop insurance provision authorizing
research and development of a policy to insure freshwater catfish producers
against reductions in the margin between the market value of catfish and
selected costs incurred in production.

The overall measure is a five-year reauthorization of federal agriculture and
nutrition programs regarding crop insurance, commodities, conservation, trade,
research, forestry, energy, rural development, horticulture, nutrition and
livestock. The 2012 Farm Bill would reduce spending by roughly $24 billion over
the next 10 years, according to a preliminary review by the Congressional Budget
Office.

The bill is now available for consideration by the full Senate.

At Va. Tech, Turning Russian Science Into Russian Sales

Kathleen Day, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FINANCIAL; Pg. D01; BIZ: TECHNOLOGY

LENGTH: 926 words

DATELINE: BLACKSBURG, Va.


Americans and Russians share a post-Cold War problem: How do you convert defense
technology into useful products on store shelves?

Scientists from Russia think they've found the answer here in the foothills of
Appalachia at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, better known as Virginia Tech, a
land grant university with research strengths in agriculture, computer
technology, transportation, materials science and the environment.

The Russians chose Virginia Tech's business incubator program after looking at
similar programs at several U.S. universities. These programs are designed to
create businesses that convert academic research into marketable products, that
convert military know-how into plowshares.

"Forty percent of the world's scientists are in the former Soviet Union," says
Alistair Brett, Virginia Tech's project director of what has become a
Moscow-based program called the International Business and Technology Incubator.
"There's tremendous potential."

Most of the Russian scientists work in institutes that were owned by the
government and are now in some stage of becoming private or semi-private
entities. Nearly all of the work at these institutes was defense-related, making
them similar to the dozens of national laboratories in this country that were
created during or in the wake of World War II for military-related scientific
research.

The goal of the program, started a year ago with a $ 2 million grant from the
U.S. Agency for International Development, is to help the Russian economy by
creating technology-based companies.

Program staffers have sifted through 200 applications to select 11 that will get
seed money to begin organizing. Electronic publishing, medical imaging, water
purification, new materials for medicine and computer software are among the
products and services the 11 businesses hope to sell, Brett said.

The program is the brainchild of Leonid Kelner and Miron Yamploski, Russians who
emigrated to America, became citizens and founded Atlas Group Inc. in Reston
four years ago to export computers, medical equipment and other items to Russia.
The company is a liaison between Virginia Tech and the Moscow program office,
which employs a dozen Russians.

Virginia Tech's business park was formally launched in 1988, when the first
building for the 120-acre corporate research center was built next to the
university's main campus.

Today, half a dozen red-brick buildings are home to 44 companies developing
products in the areas of agricultural biotechnology, materials, transportation
and electronics.

The program provides key services for start-up firms, including office space,
copying machines, secretaries and telephones the companies can share. But it
differs from similar programs because companies don't have to leave once they're
up and running and making money.

"They can stay forever," says Joe W. Meredith, president of the Virginia Tech
Corporate Research Center. "We hope they do."

IMAGINE A TOBACCO PLANT that helped cure cancer instead of causing it.

CropTech Development Corp., one of the 44 companies headquartered in Virginia
Tech's industrial park, is tinkering with the genetic code of plants.

Its goal is to create plant strains that in effect become living factories
producing proteins that scientists hope can be used as vaccines or other drugs
to treat a range of diseases that, besides cancer, include diabetes and kidney
and heart disease.

The company was founded in late 1992 by plant cell geneticist David Radin and
molecular biologist Carole Cramer, both faculty members at Virginia Tech at the
time. (Radin now works full time at the company. Cramer continues to teach,
though she is a company vice president and consultant.)

The company has received $ 900,000 from the National Institutes of Health, based
in Bethesda, in the form of small business research grants.

And the company just signed a contract for $ 99,500 from the Army's Medical
Research Acquisition Activity unit in Frederick, to try to develop tobacco and
corn that could produce a vaccine against plague.

Calling tobacco the "white rat" of plant genetics research, Rabin said the plant
is extremely hardy, fast-growing and easy to work with.

He said it will be eight to 10 years, at the earliest, before the company has a
drug for humans on the market. But he said the company hopes within three years
to bring to market several animal drugs, including a vaccine against a common
poultry disease.

ANOTHER OF THE INDUSTRIAL park companies here is Delta Power Electronics Lab
Inc. It employs only three engineers and a secretary, but the company packs a
bigger market punch than a first glance suggests.

It was started in 1989 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Products Corp. of
Fremont, Calif., which is the North American sales arm of Delta Electronics Inc.
of Taiwan, one of the world's largest providers of power supplies.

"We're their advanced research and development lab," said engineer David Crow.
"They located here because of the advanced work being done at Virginia Tech."

A key area of focus is the miniaturization of power sources for laptop
computers. The idea is to pack more power in ever-smaller units, whether a power
pack that has to be recharged or a plug-in power source.

Four years ago, Crow said, laptop wall chargers typically measured about
3-by-4-by-2 inches. Today, they are down to 1.5-by-3-by-1 inches.

The power density of the old chargers was two to three watts per cubic inch, he
said. Nowadays, it's about 10.

Senator Coons urges holistic approach to addressing domestic violence

LENGTH: 443  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Senator Chris Coons, U.S Government has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and
co-chair of the Senate Law Enforcement Caucus, spoke Tuesday at the Delaware
Coalition Against Domestic Violence's THRIVE Delaware Conference about recent
progress to expand support for victims of domestic violence and the challenges
that remain to prevent abuse and eliminate associated health disparities.

"Intimate partner violence is more than just a criminal justice or moral issue,
it's a health issue," Senator Coons said. "Women are five times more likely to
be abused by a partner and experience higher levels of disease and disability
throughout their lifetimes as a result. We've made great inroads against abuse
in large part because of the Violence Against Women Act, and this year's
reauthorization will ensure local agencies have the resources they need to
support victims, prosecute abusers, and prevent violence. We must continue
working together to educate the public, empower victims, punish offenders, and
break the cycle of abuse in our communities."

THRIVE Delaware is a multi-sector collaborative partnership that promotes
healthy relationships, individuals, and violence-free environments. The
initiative brings together health care providers, policymakers, survivors,
advocates, and prevention practitioners across an array of disciplines to
address domestic violence as a public health issue.

The Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence (DCADV) launched the THRIVE
initiative with the support of two federal grants: a $375,000 Project Connect
grant from the U.S. Office of Women's Health and Futures Without Violence and a
$1.7 million Delta Focus grant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's (CDC) Division of Violence Prevention. Funding from the grants,
awarded in January and March 2013, helped the DCADV organize its first THRIVE
Delaware conference to explore the health care response to domestic violence, as
well as prevention strategies to narrow gender health disparities. Senator Coons
wrote a letter to the CDC in October expressing his strong support for the
THRIVE initiative and urging approval of the DCADV's grant application.

The DCADV, founded in 1994, is a statewide, nonprofit organization of domestic
violence agencies, allied organizations, and supportive individuals. Over the
past 18 years, the DCADV has led efforts to increase public awareness and
enhance the services, legal remedies, and resources available to assist victims
of domestic violence in Delaware.

top story Delta Airlines saying goodbye to Dubuque A little more than a year
after arriving, Delta Airlines is ditching Dubuque. The airline that arrived as
Northwest before merging with Delta last October informed Dubuque Regional
Airport officials that it will stop serving the Dubuque market at the end of
August. A memo to the airport cited the global recession, rising oil prices and
the spread of the H1N1 virus for the airline's decision to discontinue service.

June 2008, five years after the airline pulled out of Dubuque.

services Officials with the embattled Dubuque Retirement Community have told
tenants the facility has voluntarily terminated its state certification for
assisted-living services. The organization will operate as an independent-living
facility instead. State regulators say: Not so fast. "We have grave concerns
they are not being forthcoming with their tenants," said Iowa Department of
Inspections and Appeals spokesman David Werning. Located at 2700 Matthew John
Drive, Dubuque Retirement Community, which is home to 116 residents, accrued
$6,500 in fines in a complaint investigation case earlier this year, with the
major violations stemming from an incident involving a resident who fell. In
Iowa, assisted-living facilities must provide "24 hours per day response staff
to meet scheduled and unscheduled or unpredictable needs," according to the
state's Department of Elder Affairs. Independent-living facilities do not face
similar state requirements. (After concerns from and talks with state lawmakers
and state agencies, the facility decertified in October.) other notable stories

New cardio lab one of the most advanced

BYLINE: By Maris Bennett Columnist

SECTION: MY TOWN; Eastern Contra Costa; Contra Costa; News; Local

LENGTH: 473 words


Sutter Delta Medical Center in Antioch contacted me recently with some exciting
news. Sutter is now home to a cardiovascular intervention lab, one of the most
advanced in the Bay Area.

Jeff Retherford, assistant manager of the lab, gave me a close-up tour of the
lab, which performs angioplasty.

What is unique about this lab being located at Sutter Delta is that no bypass
surgeries are performed here. According to Retherford, 80 percent fewer such
surgeries are performed today than 15 years ago. Less-invasive treatment has
become the norm.

However, the hospital sees about eight people a month suffering heart attacks.
Soon, they won't have to travel to Summit Medical (Oakland), Kaiser Permanente
or John Muir in Walnut Creek, or Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo to be
treated. Only urgent or "emergent" cases will be seen.

According to a news release, the equipment installed is a "100 percent digital
imaging system providing live, high-definition images of the entire body's
vascular systems." Before the unit is up and running, Retherford wants to
perform two drills   critiques, in his words   to make sure everything is in
perfect order. He also has contacted the state, which will send staff members to
inspect the lab and, eventually, grant permission for operation.

Once that has occurred, Retherford will approach Contra Costa County Emergency
Services so that the facility is included among those qualified to treat cardio
patients.

Many longtime Antioch residents likely can recall when Sutter Delta was not the
facility it is today: long waits in the emergency room, having to make your way
through a jumble of corridors (even portables) to end up at the correct
destination. Thankfully, those days are gone and, frankly, it is becoming
difficult to remember that the medical center resembled anything other than its
present self.

Retherford expressed pride that the multimillion dollar lab exists here; with
the building boom of the 1980s and a ballooning in the local population, he
firmly believes that a critical need has existed for a facility of this kind.

Just imagine suffering from chest pains   what a huge relief, and increased
chance of successful treatment, to be taken to a nearby unit, rather than
transported by helicopter or ambulance miles away.

Retherford said that Sutter Delta has made a "huge financial commitment" to the
cardiovascular intervention lab   not only is the technology state-of-the-art,
but he offered high praise for the medical team that will implement the
procedures.

After he served as consultant during the lab's construction, Retherford stayed
on to manage it.

I hope you won't have a need for these services.

If you do, they are now located right here in our own backyard.

Dental clinic opening caps local effort

BYLINE: JEFF MONTGOMERY jeff.montgomery@thmedia.com

SECTION: A; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 386 words


Local officials believe a first-of-its-kind dental clinic at Stonehill
Franciscan Services in Dubuque will immediately benefit local residents and
potentially pave the way for similar efforts in other communities.

Crescent Community Health Center Executive Director Julie Woodyard said this is
the first time a Federally Qualified Health Center dental clinic will be housed
in a long-term care facility. She believes the marriage makes perfect sense.

"The population of people who live here (at Stonehill) often have barriers when
it comes to getting access to oral health care. They have trouble with mobility,
they have transportation issues. We felt that by having a dental clinic here, we
can get everybody's health care needs met."

More than 20 people gathered Friday afternoon to celebrate a ceremonial "floss
cutting" at the clinic, which will serve as a satellite facility for Crescent
Community Health Center.

Iowa Senate President Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, was among the group assembled.

"We are truly trailblazers when it comes to opening this dental clinic here at
Stonehill," she said. "I think it goes back to the commitment that so many
people in this area had that, regardless of one's station in life, you should
have access to quality health care and health care you can afford. This is a
feather in Dubuque's cap."

Woodyard noted that residents at Stonehill, as well as older adults who live
near the facility, would stand to benefit from the new dental care services.

She noted that it took many years and "multiple iterations of business plans" to
bring the unique concept to fruition.

The clinic received a critical boost in the form of a $104,958 grant from Delta
Dental of Iowa Foundation. The foundation's executive director, Suzanne
Heckenlaible, attended the floss cutting and gave credit to Crescent Community
Health Center for spearheading the idea.

"This has been two-plus years in the making," she said. "It was all spearheaded
by those folks at Crescent who saw a need for providing this care to older
adults in this area."

The clinic will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Patients can schedule an appointment by calling 563-690-2852.

Heckenlaible sees the potential for growth.

"We do believe it will generate a full-time clinic and more staff will be
needed," she said.

GROWING AREAS LURE HEALTH CARE;
SHORTAGES HAVE EXPERTS WONDERING WHO WILL WORK AT THE FACILITIES IN EASTERN
CONTRA COSTA, ALAMEDA

BYLINE: GUY ASHLEY TIMES STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 1489 words


A host of health care projects planned on the eastern fringes of Alameda and
Contra Costa counties in the coming years bucks a statewide trend that has many
hospitals slashing services or closing up completely.

Experts say the contradiction is easy to explain: Families filling subdivisions
from the Delta to the Altamont hills are just the patients health care companies
are willing to bank on in precarious times marked by low insurance
reimbursements and cutthroat competition.

"These are fairly well-to-do suburban communities where the majority of people
have health insurance," said Jan Emerson, spokeswoman for the California
Healthcare Association. "Even in these tough times, hospitals can still do
fairly well where people are insured. These communities are clearly seen as a
business opportunity."

Residents are sure to be pleased by the expansion of health care options these
projects represent. But the boom in health care facilities will come with its
share of resistance and uncertainty.

Some critics wonder if the expansion into areas like Brentwood will come at the
expense of older, more established communities.

Already, Concord city officials have fought plans by the John Muir/Mt. Diablo
Health System to build a cluster of new medical offices in Brentwood that could
become a full-fledged hospital within a decade.

Several miles to the south, an expansion plan by ValleyCare Health System to
renovate an aging hospital in Livermore is facing a legal challenge by a local
tennis club. A lawsuit that targets a publicly subsidized exercise center that
is part of the plan could jeopardize the project's groundbreaking, scheduled for
later this month.

The projects also raise questions about who will staff the new facilities.
California is now gripped by a nursing shortage that is particularly bad in the
Bay Area. A survey released by the California Medical Association on Friday says
the personnel shortage has hit the ranks of doctors as well.

In east Contra Costa, where a flurry of new health care construction is
expected, a chronic shortage of both primary care doctors and specialists
exists. The director of the state Office of Statewide Health Planning, Dr. David
Carlisle, said Antioch and Pittsburg have regular places on a federal list of
physician shortage areas.

Primary care doctors are in especially short supply, Carlisle said. But
specialists are pretty tough to find, too. Despite its burgeoning population,
for instance, east Contra Costa does not have a full-time ear, nose and throat
doctor.

The chief physician recruiter at the area's only acute-care hospital said he's
finding it tougher each day to bring doctors to the region.

"We're building up our hospital to make sure we have the capacity to serve the
growing needs of this community," said Ken Harman, director of planning and
support services at Sutter-Delta Medical Center in Antioch, which is planning a
$23 million expansion next year.

"But while we do so, we have to make sure there are enough physicians in the
specific towns that the hospital serves."

Harman and others cite the high cost of living and traffic congestion as major
obstacles in physician recruitment. The also say the area's strong HMO-based
patient population means more restrictions and limitations for doctors in terms
of fees, services and the operation of their practices.

The California Medical Association report said a survey of doctors around the
state showed that 75 percent are becoming less satisfied with their work, 57
percent are having difficulty attracting new physicians to their practice or
medical group, and 43 percent are planning on either leaving California,
retiring early or changing professions.

While Muir/Diablo recently brought three new physicians to its Brentwood medical
offices, its east Contra Costa expansion plans have been dogged by controversy.

Plans for the Brentwood project were approved last week, just as the smoke was
clearing from the health system's announcement that it would be closing the
obstetrics and pediatrics wards at Mt. Diablo Medical Center in Concord.

Reacting to the Brentwood approval, Concord Mayor Laura Hoffmeister said she
feared the health system was "cutting costs and closing programs in order to
build new buildings out in Brentwood."

"We know they have no money for Mt. Diablo but they can spend millions in
Brentwood," Hoffmeister said. "Where is that money coming from?"

Hoffmeister is one of a host of critics who say the unit closures are likely a
first step toward closing Mt. Diablo altogether.

The Muir/Diablo plans, approved by the Brentwood City Council on July 6, call
for a 15,000-square-foot medical office complex on what was a walnut orchard
near the planned Highway 4 bypass.

The new offices would be about two miles from the health system's existing
Brentwood clinic, and will include doctors' offices, exam rooms, X-ray
facilities and labs.

Health system officials say the project could evolve into a small community
hospital with about 100 beds, but that such expansion is contingent on the
accuracy of future growth projections that indicate east Contra Costa will be
home to 300,000 people by the end of the decade.

The project is but one in a host of ambitious health care upgrades planned for
eastern Alameda and Contra Costa counties.

Others include:

A new 40,000-square-foot wing at Sutter-Delta Medical Center in Antioch,
currently the only acute-care hospital in east Contra Costa. The $23 million
project will house women's and children's health services and is slated to open
in 2004, said Christine Caughlin, a Sutter-Delta spokeswoman.

Kaiser-Permanente's plans to build a 54,000-square-foot outpatient medical
center in southeast Antioch. The project will sit on about 5 acres of a 73-acre
parcel Kaiser owns near Lone Tree Way and Deer Valley Road, which leaves plenty
of room for future expansion. Randy Wittorp, a Kaiser spokesman, said the
company will consider opening a full-fledged hospital on the site, but that will
depend on whether Kaiser's membership grows significantly beyond the 90,000
members it currently has in east Contra Costa.

A possible new Kaiser medical complex in Livermore. Wittorp said Kaiser is
looking for property in which to bring outpatient services into Livermore to
complement its medical complex in Pleasanton. Wittorp said doctors at the two
facilities would likely refer patients to Kaiser's hospital in Walnut Creek, or
to a new hospital in Fremont it plans to open later this year.

Expansion plans by the ValleyCare Health System at the site of Valley Memorial
Hospital in Livermore. The $30 million project planned for Stanley Boulevard
will have several components, including doctors' offices and a wellness and
rehabilitation center. It is that latter component that is being challenged in a
lawsuit filed by a local tennis club that objects to the creation of a "private
membership fitness club" that will be subsidized with public money.

"We are supposed to break ground on the project at the end of the month, but the
lawsuit may force us to push back our plans," said Tom Vargas, a Livermore City
Council member and member of the ValleyCare board of directors.

Contra Costa Supervisor Donna Gerber, whose district will soon include Brentwood
as part of a countywide redistricting plan, said she's pleased some of her
constituents will soon have improved access to health care.

But Gerber said market forces clearly are driving the push for new health care
facilities in east Contra Costa and she warns that means communities deemed less
attractive to health care concerns will likely find their choices dwindling.

"The reason everybody's all of a sudden interested in Brentwood is that's where
the younger families are moving," she said. "You can go out there and provide
health care that is less expensive to provide and make more profits."

That wouldn't be so bad, she said, "if it meant that then these companies would
take the extra money and apply it to communities that are older and have more
chronic disease."

Gerber said Muir/Diablo's move to Brentwood while closing services in Concord
illustrates a profit-over-patients trend.

But J. Kendall Anderson, president and chief executive office of the Muir/Diablo
health system, said success in Brentwood will only mean good things for the
system's patients throughout Contra Costa.

"Brentwood is going to have a health care facility whether we're there or not,"
Anderson said. "And that means Mt. Diablo is going to be vulnerable, because
somebody is going to be taking its East County patients. So strategically, it
makes more sense for us to try to get in and get a slice of that market. Then,
we'll be able to refer some of those patients to facilities like Mt. Diablo."

Airlines

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 680 words


UNITED WARMS TO MERGER: United Airlines parent UAL Corp. is in "very good
position" to pair up with another carrier despite a money-losing fourth quarter,
CEO Glenn Tilton said Tuesday.

Tilton wouldn't tip his hand about the status of talks widely reported to be
under way with Delta Air Lines Inc., which is looking at potential combinations
with either United or Northwest Airlines Corp.

But he did nothing to dampen speculation that the nation's second-biggest
airline is pushing hard to team up with Delta or, if those talks fail, another
carrier, such as Continental Airlines Inc.

Bonds

HUGE LOSS FOR AMBAC: Ambac Financial Group Inc. booked a massive loss Tuesday as
mortgage-related troubles spread, but the bond insurer assured investors that it
remains a viable company even as its business slows.

The fallout from the company's foray into bonds backed by risky mortgages led to
a $3.26 billion fourth-quarter loss.

Ambac seeks to maintain its "AAA" credit rating with two agencies and regain it
after being downgraded by a third.

Medical

UNITEDHEALTH PROFIT RISES: UnitedHealth is still working to stop customer
defections from its core health coverage business, but other offerings, such as
its Medicaid plans, gave it a 3 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit.

Its profits matched Wall Street expectations, but it said it would lose more
health insurance customers than expected in the first quarter. UnitedHealth
shares dropped $3.18, or 5.9 percent, to $51.22 Tuesday. During the past year,
they have traded at $45.82 to $59.46.

JOHNSON & JOHNSON PROFIT UP: Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson's
profit rose almost 10 percent in the fourth quarter as revenues jumped by double
digits, despite sales drops for two key product lines.

The New Brunswick, N.J.-based maker of prescription drugs, medical devices,
contact lenses and baby care items on Tuesday reported net income of $2.37
billion, or 82 cents per share, up from $2.17 billion, or 74 cents per share, a
year earlier. Excluding one-time items, net income would have been 88 cents per
share.

Courts

SUPREME COURT REJECTS ENRON SUIT: The Supreme Court dealt a probable fatal blow
Tuesday to Enron Corp. investors' efforts to recover $40 billion from Wall
Street banks in the 2001 collapse of the Texas energy company.

Without comment, the justices refused to hear arguments in the Enron case.
Attorneys for shareholders immediately vowed to return to federal court in
Houston in an attempt to prove that the investment banks misled the public and
helped conceal Enron's true financial condition.

Earnings

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS' PROFIT ROBUST: Texas Instruments Inc., the largest maker of
chips for mobile phones, said Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 13
percent and sales reversed a yearlong decline.

The company posted net income of $756 million, or 54 cents per share, including
a penny per share from a tax gain. That compared with $668 million, or 45 cents
per share, a year earlier.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 52 cents per
share.

Revenue was $3.56 billion, down 3 percent from the third quarter and $20 million
less than analysts had predicted. But sales grew 3 percent from the same quarter
in 2006, which analysts consider a better yardstick.

Compensation

NEWEST ORACLE DIRECTOR GETS OPTIONS: Business software maker Oracle Corp. has
awarded 60,000 stock options to its newest director to supplement a $52,500
annual retainer, according to documents filed Tuesday.

George Conrades, executive chairman of Akamai Technologies Inc., automatically
received the grant Jan. 15, the day Oracle appointed him to its board of
directors. The options will become fully vested in four years.

Redwood Shores-based Oracle also plans to grant Conrades an additional 45,000
stock options annually beginning in May 2009.

Besides his annual retainer, Conrades also will receive $3,000 for each
regularly scheduled board meeting and $2,000 for each special meeting he
attends.

Oracle's board met 10 times, including six special sessions, during the fiscal
year ended in May.

'Uduaghan's Legacies Difficult to Rubbish' [interview]

LENGTH: 1535 words


Comrade

is a native of Eku, Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State. He is the
chairman the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Eku branch, Iggue; in
this interview with SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

, he assesses activities in the state, and thumbs up the Emmanuel Uduaghan-led
administration for positive turnaround, among other issues.

Excerpts:

Our amiable governor is an excellent performer and this has shown clearly across
the state in the past months and l must say this that we may not know the
developmental project of the administration of Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan until after
he has left office, only then might we appreciate his good work. If you have
left Warri for the past few months, you would not believe what your eyes when
you see the facelift the governor has given to Warri and other cities across the
state. The terrible congestion we had been experiencing in the twin cities of
Warri/Effurun will soon be a thing of the past going by the free drive people
now enjoy as a result of the road network in and around Warri area. And this is
the beginning of his good work and I am not surprised given his administration's
slogan of his finishing strong everywhere. You can also attest to the fact that
our amiable governor is the only one that has embarked on free maternal health
care from zero to five age without collecting a kobo. Till date he still
consistent, paying for such treatment from government purse.

Aside free health care, the government of Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan also went into
enrolment of students in the Senior Secondary Schools, Scholarship Scheme and
which till date, he still maintains and other skill acquisition programme that
some of Delta indigenes are today enjoying. On Infrastructure and Human Capital
Development, the state government has done well, mostly on the road network
across the state both rural and urban roads that have put up a new face and all
these were achieved through the effort of the state government. Most roads in
the most cities of Delta State have been maintained through the effort of the
state government. If you have been to Enerhen Junction recently you will see for
yourself that the governor has plans for the state. We are not talking about the
dualization of the Ughelli Asaba road, Eku Asaba dualization, the Asaba airport
and a lot of road maintainers work that are being carried out by the Direct
Labour Agency. Issues of micro credit scheme to women to start one business or
the other were among the empowerment programme of the state government. All
these are aside the road construction in the state and all these are to mention
but few and to tell you that the government of Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan is on
course and working and there is every need to rally round the government. We
should equally think of what we can do to move the state forward and not only
what we will gain from the government.

To be candid, anybody who follows up his appointment as the council chairman of
Ethiope East local government area will agree with me that he is a brave and
intelligent young man who in his assumption of office was faced with serious
security challenges. But with the help of the state governor, Dr. Emmanuel
Uduaghan, Nigeria Police, State Security Service, Nigeria Army and the local
Vigilante groups, he was able to overcome it. He has reduced the menace of
kidnapping and related vices to its barest minimum. And while he was faced with
this security challenge, he never lost track of his responsibility as a council
chairman but rather he remained focused on how to move his local government to
the next level of development. All these were his show of commitment in ensuring
that he serves his people diligently; today by the grace of God, there is
relative peace in the area.

The much I know on the decision to ban Okada riding is that it was not his
making but that of the Delta State governor. If you followed the trend, the rate
of crime in the local government then was high. But today, crime rate has
dropped drastically; all these were due to his relentless effort in ensuring
that peace reigns in his domain. Also, he distributed tricycles (KEKE Napep) to
some of these commercial motorcyclists through the support of the state
government. And one thing that baffles a lot of people was his fair distribution
of these tricycles to all irrespective of the political party one belongs.

I read in the newspaper how his administration bought over 40 tricycles and gave
out at a subsidized cost of N305,000 instead of the market price of between
N400,000 and N450,000. This brought him a lot of commendation from people of the
area. And to further identify with his administration for the good work, the
leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ethiope East chapter, in their wisdom,
having seen the marvelous work he was doing, passed a confidence vote on him, a
confirmation of his good administration and as best working council chairman. He
deserves fresh tenure in Ethiope East Local Government Area.

Again as a student of the Delta State University then, I know before he assumed
office, the varsity community was having serious water problem, as almost every
home was into selling of water with over one hundred boreholes scattered
everywhere for drinking and domestic use. Today the issue of water in Abraka has
become a thing of the past after he has put in place boreholes that have the
capacity of 24,000 liters of water in every strategic corner of Abraka to
alleviate that problem of water.

The council chairman didn't stop there, other communities that were also having
similar problem of drinking water, that were mainly depending on stream water as
the water scheme given to them by state government was already bad, also called
for the services of engineers to put it in order. He also provided for them a
standby generating set, and today they are enjoying good water. The council
chairman also embarked on grading of farm roads to enable his people access
their farmland to get farm produce to the market. This I know he has done in
almost all parts of the local government area.

How do you see his flag-off of the Subsidy Reinvestment Empowerment Programme
(SURE-P) because the exercise was visited with serious complaints across the
state? I would say SURE-P flag-off in Ethiope East was excellent, perhaps the
best in the state. I personally watched the programme on Channels TV and it was
marvelous. Many other people testified to it as one of the best if not the best
because of the transparency. It was in Ethiope East that I saw that names of
beneficiaries were published in the newspaper, an indication to show that the
level of transparency was high. He also went to the extent of publishing and
announcing what Ethiope East received, which he said was the sum of
N70,670,280.06 being the share of Ethiope East Subsidy proceeds for May 2012 to
January 2013. How many council chairmen could be as transparent as that of
Ethiope East with a committee he set up to oversee the exercise? He did the flag
off with a strong emphases on what he gave out for record purpose, such as two
18-seater buses for mass transit, 30 tricycles and 10 pickup tricycles, BP
monitor for 200 beneficiaries, 200 women traders got N50,000 each to enhance
their trade. Also 100 clippers and generating sets were given out, 200 tailors
got sewing machines, 100 dryers and generating sets also given out to enhance
beneficiaries' trade. Mind you, none of these are to be paid back. His
administration also embarked on the training of 60 persons to make soap, air
freshener, insecticide and other skills. At the end of the training, they were
given starter packs to start their businesses. The empowerment is not just for
PDP alone as it cuts across every political party and non- politicians.

I join these groups in urging him to contest, though they have not spelt out
what position they want him to run for. But, I want to join the good people of
Ethiope East on this clarion call on him to come and contest the local
government election coming up soon. We have tested him and have seen him
credible to continue in order to enhance on his good work for the people of the
area. I am not just saying this because of the things he has done but for the
fact that among the council chairmen l have worked under in Ethiope East as a
unionist, he happens to be the best because of his open door policy. And most
importantly, his youth empowerment has increased the numerical strength of the
youths in the party in Ethiope East. So, when you see people coming out to say
they want him, it shows that there is something they have seen in him and which
they love in him. That is why they are calling on him to run. So, different
groups calling on him to indicate interest for an elective position is a welcome
development. In my case, I want to urge him to re-contest for the chairmanship
of Ethiope East council in the coming local government election on October 25,
2014.

My advice is that they should rally round Hon. Sunday Eromedoghene Onoriode, so
that he can as well finish strong. They should not be pushed to work for who
cannot deliver but somebody that is tested and capable to more dividends of
democracy on our doorstep.

WellSpan, York County Community Foundation form fund to give grants to EMS
companies

BYLINE: By MOLLIE DURKIN 505-5432/@ydhealth

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 505 words


Just about one year ago, WellSpan Health announced it would pull out of
emergency medical services.

Since then, the health care system discontinued its advanced life support
services and the leasing of paramedics and emergency medical technicians to
local ambulance companies.

But it hasn't pulled out of the field completely, said Keith Noll, senior vice
president of WellSpan and president of York Hospital.

WellSpan has taken on a partnership role: It's starting a medical director
program, which will provide physician services to area ambulance clubs, and has
partnered with Harrisburg Area Community College for its EMS training program,
Noll said.

And on Wednesday, WellSpan announced the creation of a large fund to support
regionalization of EMS in York County.

Grants: WellSpan established a $500,000 fund through the York County Community
Foundation and will match additional contributions, up to $250,000, Noll said.
The organization hopes to grow the fund to $1 million.

WellSpan encourages regionalization because the county has a very high
concentration of EMS providers in central York but not in rural areas, Noll
said. EMS providers that regionalize can give care geographically based on need,
rather than resources, he said.

York County EMS providers are eligible to apply for grants through the fund,
said Jane Conover, chief operating officer for the foundation.

The grant money will provide financial support that allows EMS providers to come
together and give structure to the system in York County, she said. Some
regionalization expenses covered under the grants include legal services,
equipment replacement, technology and rebranding programs.

There is no maximum grant size at this point, and the foundation hopes to give a
grant by the end of the year, Conover said.

She anticipates it will give out the full amount of the fund over the next few
years.

Coming together: Ambulance companies are on a limited budget, so it helps to
collaborate and share resources, said Rod Drawbaugh, chairman of West York
Ambulance's board of directors. The company works with York Regional EMS.

He said he's openly invited other companies to join in on the effort because, in
the end, it's all about giving patients the right care in an efficient, timely
way.

"We hope that we can make this regionalization approach really work," Drawbaugh
said.

York Regional EMS changed its name last fall from Yoe Ambulance Service, said
EMS Chief Ted Hake.

"We've been York Regional in spirit all along," he said.

About 30 individual EMS companies serve York County, but not many partnerships
have formed in the past year, Hake said. Delta and Fawn Grove's fire departments
are an example of a regionalization success, and other companies are in
discussions about working together, he said.

Now, having the opportunity for funding "eliminates significant hurdles" and
will help companies pay for the costs of consolidation, Hake said.

"This is an unprecedented opportunity. This is a new era," he said.

Delta Dental Plan of Oklahoma has received approval from the Oklahoma Board of
Dentistry to provide Oklahoma's dentists, dental hygienists, and dental
assistants with online continuing dental education.

Approved for one-hour of continuing dental education credit, the Prevent Abuse
and Neglect through Dental Awareness program was developed to help dentists and
their dental staff to recognize some of the signs and symptoms of child abuse
and neglect. The program also addresses the reporting process involved when
cases of child abuse and neglect are detected.

"To help prevent the growing number of child abuse cases, every state has passed
legislation to increase the reporting of suspected abuse and neglect, said Tad
Mabry, with W.W. Hastings Indian Hospital in Tahlequah, and author of the
program. "As mandated reporters of abuse, dentists are required to report any
child suspected of being abused or neglected. We are very grateful to Delta
Dental Plan of Oklahoma for making this important educational program available
on their Web site and hope it will not only make it easy for dental
practitioners to garner continuing dental education credit -- but more
importantly -- to use this information to help stem the tide of abuse in
Oklahoma."

Located at www.deltadentalok.org in the "Dentists" section, the program consists
of an "Introduction" section, a 112-slide presentation and a test. Individuals
passing the test will receive a certificate of completion and the appropriate
form for submission to the Board of Dentistry to receive their continuing dental
education credit.

More information is available from Tom Searls, corporate communications manager
for Delta Dental Plan, at 607-2178.

OU Medical Center featured

The University of Oklahoma Medical Center will be featured on The Discovery
Health Channel's The Critical Hour.

The first of four one-hour shows was televised Sunday. OU Medical Center was the
first hospital to be featured on the new show. The second show featuring the
hospital will run at 7 p.m. Sunday.

The first episode of the show featuring the OU Medical Center included two
accidents occurring late at night in Oklahoma City.

The second episode features the story of a 17-year-old boy shot in the chest
during a fight. Open-heart surgery reveals that the bullet has caused a spinal
cord injury. Paramedics are later called to the home of an infant who has just
had a frightening seizure. Medics must get her to the hospital so doctors can
prevent another seizure and investigate the cause.

Dental facility opens

Michael K. Kirk has opened a new dental facility at 1057 NW Grand Blvd.

Grand Dental Studio is the new name for Kirk's dental practice.

"The name emphasizes that science and artistry are blended when it comes to
providing patients with the highest levels of aesthetic dentistry," Kirk said.

"Grand Dental Studio is a welcome addition to the Western Avenue area where
there are three miles of Oklahoma City's best restaurants, clubs, shops, and
galleries," said Richard Duncan, vice president of MidFirst Bank and leader of
the Western Avenue Association.

Grand Dental Studio provides general, cosmetic, and implant dental care.

Kirk has practiced dentistry since 1993. He is a graduate of the University of
Oklahoma College of Dentistry. Kirk received additional post-graduate training
in dental implantology at the University of Texas.

Smallpox vaccination training

The Oklahoma State Health Department has scheduled smallpox vaccination training
for nurses from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Thursday at the University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center Student Center, 1106 N. Stonewall in Oklahoma City.

The training is part of Oklahoma's plan for vaccinating frontline health care
workers who would investigate or treat cases of smallpox resulting from a
bioterrorism event. The smallpox vaccine is given using a special bifurcated
needle. Since smallpox vaccinations were discontinued in the United States in
1972, very few of today's nurses have had experience in giving this vaccine.

Participants will include nurses from the city-county health departments in
Oklahoma City and Tulsa, the Indian Health Services, and the Veterans
Administration Medical Center.

MDA awards grants

The Muscular Dystrophy Association has awarded a $240,000 research grant to
Sanjay Bidichandani, at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City to examine
what causes the genetic defects underlying Friedrichs' ataxia.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma's PPO and HMO networks have received
Health Plan accreditation by URAC. Its major PPO health plans, BlueChoice and
BluePreferred, have also received Health Network and Health Utilization
Management accreditation.

URAC is a nonprofit organization that has issued more than 2,000 accreditation
certificates to more than 500 managed care organizations in all 50 states and
Canada.

This is the first time BlueLincs HMO has applied for and received accreditation.
BlueLincs serves more than 31,000 Oklahomans.

BluePreferred was one of the first health plans in the nation to receive URAC
accreditation in 1996. BlueChoice first applied for and received accreditation
in 1999. Combined, the two plan networks serve more than 425,000 Oklahomans.

OU Physicians

Timothy J. Lyons has been named chief of endocrinology, diabetes and
hypertension at OU Physicians.

Lyons been involved in diabetes treatment and drug research and is a lecturer
and author on the subject.

Lyons previously practiced at Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston.

Marvin D. Peyton of Cushing, has been named chief of cardiothoracic surgery for
OU Physicians. Peyton is involved in discovering improved treatment methods for
patients experiencing inflammation during cardiac surgery. Peyton was formerly a
partner with Oklahoma Cardiovascular Surgery Associates. Peyton received his
medical education from the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine.

Ivan Wayne, a facial plastic surgeon, has established his practice with OU
Physicians. Wayne comes to Oklahoma from the University of Miami School of
Medicine, where he completed a fellowship in facial plastic and reconstructive
surgery. He completed his residency at the University of Rochester Medical
Center, New York, and received his medical degree from the University of Iowa
College of Medicine, Iowa City.

Susan M. Edwards has been named medical director of radiology at OU Physicians.
She specializes in administering, supervising and interpreting X-ray, ultrasound
and other types of imaging studies.

Edwards is responsible for development of radiology services and the
standardization of body imaging protocols. She was a partner with Oklahoma
Radiology Group and medical director of MRI and Body Imaging and LakePointe
Imaging Center.

Edwards is a Fellow of the American College of Radiology. She completed a
diagnostic imaging fellowship from the University of Oklahoma College of

Agenda light for council: Fair Housing resolution requested

BYLINE: Ron Booth, The Duncan Banner, Okla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 506 words


Mar. 23--The agenda won't be as full Tuesday night during the regular meeting of
the Duncan City Council, but the council will have several important items to
discuss.

First item up for approval will be making April Fair Housing Month, which will
tie in with a request to approve the Fair Housing resolution.

The council will then consider making an application to the Oklahoma Housing
Finance Agency for an Owner Occupied Rehabilitation grant for $250,000. If the
grant is approved, the City of Duncan would contract with Delta Community
Foundation Inc. to write the grant application for the city and provide
professional grant administrator services if the funding is awarded. A $10,000
administration fee is to be paid from the HOME OOR grant funds, if awarded. That
would be approved under the fifth agenda item.

The city would also have to come up with a 25 percent match that can be reduced
to $16,250 through the state mortgage revenue bond program. The remaining
$46,250 can be met through local donations of time and services, such as fee
waivers, trash services, demolition, removal and disposal of existing
structures.

The first item up for discussion and approval is the consent agenda which
contains the following items:

--Purchase Order list of claims.

--Issuance of April blanket purchase orders as required by OS 62, Section 310.8.

--WW Builders Pay Request No. 4 in the total amount of $116,198.30 for services
rendered on the Road Improvements 2008 Project.

--T & G Construction Pay Request No. 13 in the total amount of $286,564.08 for
services rendered on the Revenue Bond Road Improvements 2007 Project.

--EST Inc. Pay Request No. 19 in the amount of $50,145.80 for professional
services rendered in conjunction with the Revenue Bond Street Improvements
Project.

--Purchase of water service materials for the Water Distribution Department from
Pioneer Supply in the amount of $4,654.

--Purchase of U.S. Phantom Patrol Radar from U.S. Radar Inc. for a 2008
Chevrolet Lake Patrol Vehicle.

--Send a letter of recommendation to District Judge Joe Enos to appoint Tom
Daughtrey to the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District board of directors.
Daughtrey will join Barry Duren and Eric Davis as board members.

The council will also consider a request from Duncan Regional Hospital for a
health care facility permit for the DRH's west wing expansion project.

The list item up is considering approval of professional services with Crafton,
Tull, Sparks & Associates for engineering services for the pump station
improvement project.

The contract would not exceed $40,000 and authorize the mayor to execute the
contract.

An Interventionist Agency Handicapped By Low Funding [opinion]

BYLINE: Jack Kalio

LENGTH: 1773 words


The problems of uncompleted projects seem to have cast a long shadow on the
image the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Sadly, this seems to have
been a recurring decimal as one board hands over to another over the years since
the commission was established by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration in
December 2,000. This hangover, which has remained a big drag on the commission's
performance, runs counter to the main objective of setting up the agency as a
veritable change agent.

The effects of the unfortunate phenomenon have impacted negatively on its
mandate to transform the Niger Delta region that produces over 90 per cent of
the country's oil wealth. This, perhaps, informed the directive from the
Presidency to the recently dissolved board of the NDDC to "complete all on-going
projects handled by the previous boards before embarking on new ones." However,
no matter the directives handed down by successive governments, efforts of
successive boards have always been constrained by several factors, including
inadequate funding. Perhaps, the last board headed by Senator Bassey Ewa-Henshaw
was the worst hit in this regard. Worried by the situation, the Ewa-Henshaw-led
board took the message of poor funding to the governors of Edo, Bayelsa, Abia
and Cross River states. The then chairman of the NDDC board lamented that over
N800 billion due to the interventionist agency was being withheld over the
years. In addition, he said, the N45 billion accruing from the ecological funds
was also outstanding.

Ewa-Henshaw explained that the withheld funds arose from non-compliance with the
Act establishing the commission. According to him, the Act establishing the NDDC
states clearly how the commission shall be funded. Section 14[2] provides that
"there shall be paid and credited to the fund established pursuant to subsection
[1] of this section; [a] from the Federal Government the equivalent of 15 per
cent of the total monthly allocation due to the member states of the commission
from the federation account, this being the contribution of the Federal
Government to the commission; [b] three per cent of the total annual budget of
any oil-producing company operating onshore and offshore in the Niger Delta
area, including gas processing companies; [c] 50 per cent of monies due to
member states of the commission from the ecological fund..." and other sources
such as grants and loans.

The former board chairman stated that the NDDC had since inception been getting
10 per cent instead of the statutory 15 per cent from the Federal Government. He
appealed to the governors of the states covered by the NDDC to push for the
proper funding of the commission by the central government and the oil
companies.

He regretted that major legacy projects that would have given the economy of the
region a boost have suffered because of inadequate funding; and that the board
he headed inherited about 7,000 projects and a liability in excess of one
trillion naira, including Interim Payment Certificates (IPC's) that were not
paid. "Funding remains a major challenge and obstacle to the progress that we
could have made. For example, since 2001, funds held back by the Federal
Government is now in excess of N800 billion," he said.

Apart from the Federal Government which did not comply with the provisions of
the Act, especially during the Obasanjo years, some of the oil companies have
also not been paying the three per cent of their annual budget as required by
law. Records show that they would first deduct the charges before calculating
the three per cent from the balance.

The reactions of the governors to the lamentations of the NDDC were captured by
the views of the Bayelsa State Governor, Chief Seriake Dickson, who urged the
Federal Government to give special attention to states in the Niger Delta, given
the challenging terrain of the various communities, which requires huge funds
and efforts to develop.

He said: "The Niger Delta is an endangered region, even the colonial masters
before they granted independence to Nigeria, recognized the existence of this
region as a special area and designated it so. And they were aware that the
developmental challenges of this area are more than that of the challenges of
most other parts of the country.

According to the governor, the Niger Delta challenges were ecological and
environmental and that realization should affect the release of funds by the
federal authorities. "The purpose of establishing the NDDC will be defeated if
it is not in a position to undertake critical development projects in the Niger
Delta; its purpose will be meaningless, if it will only award contracts for
construction of classroom blocks and other jobs that may not have the capacity
to impact the development of the area," he said.

Faced with the daunting challenges, the NDDC management says it has spared no
effort in ensuring that it delivered on its mandate. Managing Director, Bassey
Dan-Abia, says the commission has completed over 1,500 projects spread across
the region. The projects, he said, cover diverse areas such as roads, bridges,
electricity, education infrastructure, water supply, canalization, erosion
control, shore protection and land reclamation, among others. Of course, human
capacity development also got a fair share of attention.

For instance, the NDDC management started by handing over a 522-bed space modern
hostel to the authorities of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO)
in Imo State, on February 5, 2014. The students were over the moon with joy and
excitement. The hostel at the Imo State University, Owerri, had earlier blazed
the trail. The Vice Chancellor of FUTO, Professor Chigozie Asiabaka, stated that
the NDDC had largely fulfilled its mandate of facilitating the rapid, even and
sustainable development of the Niger Delta region by providing projects that
significantly affect the lives of the people.

Meanwhile, the NDDC's provision of the right environment for learning in
tertiary institutions in the region is not limited to FUTO. The commission has
also built 18 other hostels in universities and polytechnics across the Niger
Delta. On March 19, 2014, it was the turn of the University of Benin, UNIBEN, to
celebrate NDDC's gesture. The UNIBEN modern hostel built by the commission was
commissioned by Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, the then Governor of Delta State. Eight
months later, precisely November 13, Dr. Uduaghan was called upon again to
commission another NDDC hostel. This time, students of the Delta State
University, Abraka, were the ones dancing in jubilation. The university
authorities were not left out in the fanfare. The Deputy Vice Chancellor of the
university, Prof. Chukwuemeka Aloamaka, commended the NDDC "for coming to the
aid of the university by building and furnishing this hall of residence. The
imperative of accommodation for students remains a big challenge and the NDDC
has done noble in helping us."

Last month, the commission again handed over a similar 630 bed-space
ultra-modern hostel to the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike in
Abia State and that of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital in Akwa Ibom
State.

The contributions of the NDDC to the education sector are not limited to
infrastructure. According to Dan-Abia, the interventionist agency had in recent
times provided "science equipment to our secondary schools; retrained 500
science teachers and 225 principals and vice principals, for capacity
enhancement in schools management and administration. It has also provided 3,600
sets of computers to all the polytechnics in the region and awarded 1,021
overseas scholarships for Master degrees and PhD programmes in engineering and
sciences, including medicine to children of the nine NDDC states, in the best
universities across the world." Mindful of the contributions of youths to the
development process, the NDDC has initiated different programmes to build their
capacity in the Niger Delta. On Tuesday, March 18, 2014, it organized the First
Niger Delta Regional Youth Conference on Ethics and Value Re-Orientation where
it articulated a 3-point agenda of capacity building, wealth creation and
employment generation for the youths of the region.

The NDDC Managing Director said: "It is my belief that when we develop and
empower young people, we are bound to reduce crime and violence in the region,
as well as the concomitance of kidnappings and vandalism of public
infrastructure, especially oil installations, which is negatively affecting our
economy today." Another key aspect of NDDC youth development scheme focuses on
training the youths to gain useful skills which would fetch them gainful
employment. The fruits of this strategy are beginning to manifest as statistics
made available by the commission indicate that a total of 5,765 youths across
the Niger Delta Region have so far benefited from these skill programmes.

In the area of agriculture, the commission says it has distributed over 100
tractors to ministries of agriculture in the nine Niger Delta states to boost
food production. It also mentioned 27 tractors to the Oil Producers Trade
Section (OPTS) group, for delivery to farmer cooperatives in their respective
host communities. The commission's Director of Agriculture and Fisheries, Dr.
Godspower Amadi, said mechanized agriculture was a sure way to increase food
production and employment generation for the youths. He said that the commission
had been running agricultural training programmes in conjunction with Songhai
Delta, a capacity building and youth empowerment centre based in Amukpe, Delta
State. There is a claim that NDDC has trained over 6,500 youths in various
aspects of agriculture in the centre. Of all the development projects which the
NDDC has undertaken in the Niger Delta, the one that seems to have brought
tremendous relief and makes immediate impact on the lives of the rural people is
the free Health Care Programme from which 5,000 patients are said to have
benefited since the coming of the new management. The free Health Care Missions
have been taken to virtually all corners of the Niger Delta.

Findings showed that the commission is building three specialist hospitals in
Bayelsa State (orthopedic), Akwa Ibom State (cardio-vascular) and Rivers State
(cardio-vascular) in partnership with private sector service providers. Perhaps,
just perhaps, with better funding and less scandal, the commission would have
been able to turn around the muddy terrains of the Niger Delta so that the
people who have sat in darkness for so long can see light at last. -

LENGTH: 420 words


Oct. 12--The Greeley Stampede put more than $980,000 back into the community
after the 95th annual event.

The donations from the 2016 event are nearly 10 times that of previous years,
according to a news release from the Stampede.

The Stampede annually partners with community organizations to help with
fundraising and awareness campaigns. Donors are assigned event tasks in exchange
for the donations, which go to help with community outreach and to make capital

to Wear Pink," which benefits the North Colorado Medical Center's Breast Center.
Events such as the Western Art Show, golf tournament and Big Buckle Ball benefit
the Stampede Foundation, which in turn offers education-based scholarships to
local youth. The Weld Food Bank also partnered with the Stampede to offer the
CanSculpture Challenge. During the event, a discount on the carnival wristband
in exchange for canned foods helped collect more than 500 pounds of food.

"We appreciate the support we receive from the community during our event and we
want to continually find ways to support our community," Justin Watada, Stampede
general manager said in the release.

The community organizations benefiting from the donations include A Women's
Place, Boy Scout Troop 53, Boy & Girls Clubs, CEEN Head Start, Celebration

Work continues toward bringing health care clinic to Oakley

BYLINE: By Roni Gehlke For the Contra Costa Times

SECTION: MY TOWN; Eastern Contra Costa; Contra Costa; News; Local

LENGTH: 588 words


OAKLEY -- For 25 years, Maria Juanita Fernandez has lived with diabetes, which
she said requires significant care that is difficult to afford without
insurance.

"Diabetes is like cancer. It starts damaging parts of your body a little bit at
a time," Fernandez told a standing-room-only audience Sept. 15 to discuss plans
to bring a health care clinic to the city.

Three years ago, Fernandez said she had a wound on her foot because of
complications from diabetes. Because she could not afford the treatment, she
didn't immediately seek medical attention for the injury, and had to have her
toe amputated.

With no insurance, Fernandez was given a $34,000 bill for her treatment. She was
able to pay $6,000 before she had to stop working because of health reasons.

Only six months later, she had another lesion on her toe that would not heal.
This time, she went to Mexico and was charged $100 for treatment. Three months
ago, she had another toe amputated.

"We need a clinic here in Oakley," she said through a translator. "Many of the
people my age can't drive and can't get to other clinics out of town. We deserve
to have preventive care in this situation."

Stories like Fernandez's inspired a group at St. Anthony Church to look into why
the city, home to more than 36,000 residents, does not have a doctor's office,
much less a clinic to help the uninsured.

Over the past five years, Contra Costa Interfaith Supporting Community
Organization (CCISCO) has worked with city leaders and several local legislators
to open a clinic in Oakley with the help of an Oakland-based organization, La
Clinica. La Clinica is preparing to sign a lease on a space in Cypress Square
Plaza off Main Street by Big Break Road.

At last week's forum, CCISCO representatives honored several contributors and
volunteers for their effort to bring the clinic to Oakley. They also said they
are $163,562 from reaching their fundraising goal.

"We have received many generous donations," CCISCO co-chairwoman Iris Gomez
said.

So far, the group has racked up $915,000 through several large contributors,
including John Muir Health Foundations ($450,000), Sutter Delta Medical Center
($200,000) and Kaiser Permanente ($40,000).

Gomez said the group is waiting for Kaiser's national board of directors to sign
off on an additional $500,000 grant that will not only help the clinic open its
doors but also provide the needed funds to sustain the operation for the next
three years.

"Kaiser is the key," Oakley City Manager Bryan Montgomery said.

He said that if the grant comes through, the clinic could open its doors early
next year.

Additional funding would be necessary for the clinic to stay open. One option
for funding could be the federal health care bill signed into law in March.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allows for money to support
clinics in communities throughout the nation. Supporters of the Oakley clinic
hope that their community will be one of them. The federal grants will not be
decided until next summer.

Help from local leaders would be needed to obtain the funding, Montgomery said.
Gomez encouraged residents to continue writing letters to let legislators know
of the need for a clinic in Oakley.

The clinic will offer an array of medical services, including prenatal care and
referrals to specialists. Most important to organizers here, La Clinica will
make special efforts to accommodate low-income residents. The clinic will help
new patients access state and federal health care funds, and offer services on a
sliding-fee scale.

ATLANTA TECH: More Israeli firms find Atlanta a happy home

BYLINE: Mark Clothier, Staff

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Business; Pg. 9D

LENGTH: 937 words

Four years ago, an Israeli firm decided to test American waters.

Jacada, then known as Client/Server Technologies, sent an employee to Chicago to
try to land a customer for its software that could justify the setting up of a
U.S. office.

The company signed Mapics, an Atlanta-based resource planning software company.
The contract was big enough that the company considered Atlanta as a potential
office site, to be close enough to support its software.

From there, Jacada's decision became more subjective. And the factors its
executives considered were similar to ones many Israeli firms now consider when
deciding where to set up U.S. offices:

High-tech firms everywhere are having a tough time finding trained employees.
But some companies are finding it easier to recruit workers to Atlanta than to
ask them to move to Northern cities, said David Holmes, Jacada's senior vice
president of marketing.

Depending on the time of year, Israel is six or seven hours ahead of the East
Coast of the United States. Setting up offices in a city in the Eastern time
zone extends the business day of an Israeli firm by at least one hour, three
hours more than a West Coast city. "The guys in Israel are already working long
hours to keep up with us as it is," Holmes said. "The nine or 10 hours on the
West Coast would make it nearly impossible."

Delta Air Lines' transportation hub makes it easier to fly directly to any major
U.S. city and meet with customers or prospects. Also, the 12-hour flight from
Atlanta to Tel Aviv is at least five hours shorter than a flight from the West
Coast to Israel.

These decisions are being made more and more. Israel has more high- technology
start-up firms and more publicly traded companies on Wall Street than any
countries except the United States and Canada. But with a population of less
than 6 million, Israel has a small market for those companies to sell to.

The United States, home to 273 million, represents one of the larger markets.

An Israeli company is setting up a regional office or a U.S. headquarters in
Atlanta every four to six weeks, said Tom Glaser, president of the Southeastern
branch of the America-Israel Chamber of Commerce.

More than 30 Israeli firms have either an office or a U.S. headquarters in
Atlanta, according to the Government of Israel Economic Mission.

Jacada established its U.S. base in Atlanta in 1995. Giddeon Hollander, Jacada's
chief executive and co-founder, moved to Atlanta in March. The company raised $
49 million with an initial public offering of its stock in October. The
company's research, development and manufacturing base remains in Israel.

Israel invests money --- with strings attached --- in the research and
development programs of high-technology companies based there.

The companies then pay to the government a small percentage of the money made
from products developed in state-funded programs. Companies such as Jacada that
take the money also agree to make the state-developed products in Israel even
after the grants are repaid, according to Jacada's Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. A firm can be granted an exception on the manufacturing rule
but would pay higher royalties.

So Atlanta is home to Jacada's sales, marketing and customer support
departments, Holmes said.

Intacta Technologies moved its U.S. headquarters from Silicon Valley to Atlanta
earlier this month.

The Israeli firm moved because of the cost of living and the time difference,
but also for more practical reasons: It hired Noel Bambrough as executive vice
president, and Bambrough lived in Atlanta.

"They found they were having a tough time attracting and keeping trained people
in Silicon Valley," he said. "Companies in Atlanta don't have the same problem
to that extent."

Intacta develops software that compresses, encrypts, codes and sends data. The
product is used to allow hand-held computing devices to communicate with PCs and
PC networks, Bambrough said. The company employs six in downtown Atlanta offices
and 15 in Israel. Bambrough expects to hire more in Atlanta soon.

The amount of business being conducted by Georgia firms is increasing. Georgia
companies exported $ 148 million worth of goods and products to Israel last
year, a 37 percent increase from 1997. That amount puts Georgia eighth on the
list of states that export to Israel; second in the Southeast, behind Louisiana.

"I doubt anyone's really quantified the exact amount for Atlanta-area firms, but
it's a lot," Glaser said. "It's not more than New York or Boston. But it's
bigger than any other city on the East Coast. New York, to the Israeli, is the
center of the universe on the East Coast. And Boston has a lot of technology
companies and a lot of venture capital."

Glaser leads attempts to recruit Israeli companies to either establish U.S.
headquarters in Atlanta or at least regional offices. Gov. Roy Barnes is leading
a group of Georgia business people on a trip to Israel in May. Part of the trip
is designed to attract Israeli high-tech firms to Atlanta. Florida Gov. Jeb Bush
led a similar trip earlier this month.

American venture capital firms are noticing Israel's blossoming high-tech
community. They invested $ 620 million in Israeli firms in the first nine months
of 1999; $ 261 million came in the third quarter. That take is comparable to
firms in New Jersey ($ 263 million) and Northern Virginia, home to America
Online. Venture firms invested $ 269 million in Virginia companies in the third
quarter. Georgia firms attracted $ 168 million in venture capital over the same
three months.

Bridge to somewhere: Eastern Arkansas town plots a path to prosperity

BYLINE: Vaughn Stewart III, The Anniston Star, Ala.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 2492 words


Aug. 14--Editor's Note: This is the first in a three-part series on community
development efforts in Helena-West Helena, Ark., that may be instructive for
Anniston.

HELENA-WEST HELENA, Ark. -- Sporting an emerald polo shirt and a sable mustache,
the bank executive reclines in his desk chair until it creaks. His right leg,
bent at a 90-degree angle, rests on his left. His head is cocked back, supported
by interlocked palms.

Joe Black is relaxing, and rightfully so. Over the past few years, he has pulled
his town back from the abyss.

The population of Helena-West Helena -- formerly two towns that consolidated in
2006 -- is 15,000, down 40 percent since 1965 and 20 percent since 2000. With
almost 40 percent of residents below the poverty line, Helena (pronounced
Helen-uh, not Hel-lee-nuh, as locals will quickly point out) is one of the
poorest towns in one of the poorest counties in Arkansas. Its public schools
have twice been taken over by state authorities.

Yet, Helena is now on the verge of a renaissance, community leaders say. Locals
have renewed hope in the town.

And Black thinks the story of its innovation could echo east and west of the
nearby Mississippi River.

'A symbiotic relationship with their community'

During the post-war boom, Helena bustled with the sounds of blues musicians and
rowdy saloons. Older locals still remember walking sideways down Cherry Street,
downtown's main artery, to weave through the hordes of pedestrians. Today, you'd
probably have the sidewalk mostly to yourself.

Helena's downfall was precipitated by the usual suspects of small-town decay:
manufacturing job loss and agricultural mechanization. Black blamed "lack of
foresighted leadership" for Helena's problems.

"Didn't you know the mine was eventually going to go dry?" he thundered. "Didn't
you see people building tractors eventually? And once they started building
them, making them larger and more efficient?"

Black is the president of Southern Bancorp Capital Partners, the nonprofit wing
of Southern Bancorp Inc., the largest and most profitable rural development bank
in the country. Unlike the average bank, Southern has goals like reducing the
poverty and unemployment rates written into its mission statement.

"Southern Bancorp recognizes that banks have a symbiotic relationship with their
community," Black reasoned. "If the community grows and prospers, the bank grows
and prospers. If the community dies or loses population, the bank usually goes
down, too."

Through the 1980s, Helena's entire economy was structured to entice businesses
with cheap labor, Black said. He said free-trade deals shipped those jobs
overseas, leaving the town with an underdeveloped workforce and a devalued
school system.

Mohawk Rubber Co., plagued with labor and production problems, shuttered in
1979. The area's largest employer, Mohawk counted 675 workers in its prime.

Two decades of deterioration followed before the town finally hit bottom. The
indictment of West Helena city councilmen for stealing public money represented
a final indignity.

"No one could pretend anymore. All of our stores closed downtown. It was
literally boarded up," Black recalled.

First, the bank hoped that providing access to capital to county residents would
lead to innovation and recovery. Loans alone, though, did nothing to rid Helena
of its more systematic afflictions.

"We realized that lending by itself just won't do it in rural markets. Too many
things are out of place and need fixin'," Black lamented.

300 residents, 500 meetings, 18 months

Backs against the wall, Black and his colleagues first commissioned a baseline
study to evaluate past development efforts. The national consultant group found
several instances of well-meaning reformers parachuting into the Delta region
periodically, promising to "save you people" before packing up their tents after
a short stay.

"You don't fight endemic poverty with a two- to three-year program. You fight it
with a long-term, sustainable, multi-generational program," Black opined. "It
took decades to get into this situation and, well, it might take a few decades
to get out of this."

Ultimately, Southern created the "Delta Bridge Project" in 2005 to serve as a
private-public umbrella organization that coordinates redevelopment activity in
the county. The Delta Bridge Project focuses on what it calls the six pillars of
the community: economic development, tourism, health care, housing, education
and leadership.

The Walton Family foundation -- the family behind Wal-Mart and a ubiquitous
benefactor for all things Arkansas -- heavily funded the project. In return, the
Delta Bridge Project became the foundation's grant-making intermediary in the
region.

The next step was to develop a comprehensive strategy to transform Helena into a
dynamic economic center. In doing so, Southern listened to ideas from the entire
community. A detailed five-year plan was conceived after 300 residents
participated in 500 meetings over 18 months. City officials endorsed the plan;
residents, including potential investors, had reason to believe in Helena again.

In 2009, the Delta Bridge Project upgraded the plan to span 2010-2020.

In 2008 the project was one of 45 small-town improvement strategies profiled by
a University of North Carolina study titled Small Towns, Big Ideas. The study's
authors cited Delta Bridge's inclusive planning and implementation process as a
reason for its success and a lesson for other communities.

"The value of a community or strategic plan or vision document depends entirely
on the extent to which a truly representative sample of the community is
involved in creating the plan," the study's authors wrote. "Plans that are
created by a subset of any community are destined to affect only the subset
involved in its creation."

Eliminating the 'us versus them' mindset

Tim Schuringa describes the two objectives of the Delta Bridge Project as
"aligning existing resources and providing access to funding" for local
initiatives.

Schuringa first arrived in Helena as a Teach For America corps member and stayed
after his two-year commitment to aid in Helena's redevelopment efforts. Teach
For America is a national nonprofit organization that recruits bright college
graduates and places them in low-income school districts. He and his colleague,
Julia Nordsieck, herself a former TFA educator in New York, are both now
community development officers for Southern. They perform much of the
organization's behind-the-scenes work, including researching and writing grants.

"It's not about creating something out of nothing. It's not about Tim or Julia
or Joe or somebody from Southern magically making something happen," Schuringa
said. "It's about serving as a catalyst for the ingredients that you already
have."

The Delta Bridge Project has whipped up an entire menu of successes in seven
short years.

Initially, the program focused on short-term, visible projects that could
inspire hope and erode cynicism in the community. For one, it engineered a
massive demolition of more than 300 dilapidated properties in the area.

The necessity of shared resources during the 2005 cleanup likely catalyzed the
consolidation of Helena and West Helena the next year. While Helena boasts an
historic downtown comparable to Anniston's Noble Street, West Helena could be
characterized as a smaller Oxford, with an array of big-box retailers and fast
food chains.

"The consolidation kept two hands from reaching for one piece of pie. It also
helped us begin to eliminate an 'us versus them' mindset," Black said.

That same year, the Delta Area Health Education Center opened its doors with the
help of a $1 million low-interest loan from the Delta Bridge Project. The
organization has also offered low-interest loans to private investors willing to
purchase one of Helena's many historic homes.

Delta AHEC features an exercise center and educates the community on issues like
obesity, drug use and hypertension. Through a federal grant, it provides car
seats to soon-to-be mothers. Using technology straight out of The Jetsons,
patients can walk into the Delta AHEC in Helena and have a video consultation
with doctors in Little Rock or Fayetteville.

In 2006, an old lumber store was converted into a Boys & Girls Club and the
Delta Bridge Project pitched in $240,000. In a typical example of leaders
wearing multiple hats, several of those who spearheaded the project were also
affiliated with Southern Bancorp and the Delta Bridge Project.

Nearly 200 children visit the club every day, where they can play basketball and
tennis, participate in science projects and receive homework help.

The Delta Bridge Project's fingerprints are also on 20 high-quality units of
low-income housing, a harvest of burgeoning tourist sites and a successful new
charter school downtown.

"Without us being part of the process, I don't think this project would've been
done yet," Schuringa said.

Schuringa was referencing the Delta Bridge Project's efforts on behalf of a new
public library, but could have been referring to a plethora of other initiatives
across the county, including the revival of a popular blues festival, the
construction of charter school buildings and the creation of a biodiesel plant.

'Our numbers are growing'

In a town full of innovation, Terrance Clark and Will Staley pilot perhaps
Helena's most pioneering venture. Clark and Staley run Thrive, a creative
consulting firm that conducts marketing campaigns for local businesses at
below-market rates.

Clark and Staley met at art school. It shows. The walls of their downtown office
are plastered with canvases. They then attended graduate school together at New
York's prestigious Pratt Institute. One night, while talking on the phone in
Brooklyn, they hatched a plan to take their skills to Helena after graduation.
Staley grew up in Little Rock and was familiar with the town.

"In New York City, I was a pebble in a Japanese water foundation," Clark said.
"Here, I can call the mayor up and say I want to sit down and talk to you today.
The closest I ever got to the mayor in New York was selling fruit to him at a
farmer's market. There is an opportunity to do more here."

Using profit generated from their ad campaigns, Thrive operates two nonprofit
initiatives in partnerships with organizations like the local community college,
the Chamber of Commerce and Southern Bancorp. It received a $186,000 grant from
the Delta Bridge Project.

The Helena Entrepreneurial Center, an idea dreamt up in the original Delta
Bridge master plan, is a one-year program for budding entrepreneurs that helps
them get their business off the ground. It includes 12 weeks of business
classes, marketing materials and help on creating a business plan. At the end of
the curriculum, the aspiring capitalists present their ideas to the community.

Secondly, Clark and Staley shepherd Helena Second Saturdays, a downtown
revitalization effort featuring art and music displays on the second Saturday of
every month. The inaugural event in June attracted 15 local artists and
craftsmen and 300 residents.

"We're declaring this, on our own, an arts and entertainment district," Clark
said.

Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, chronicled his short stay in Helena
in Life on the Mississippi. After describing the deteriorated state of the town
following a flood, the classic American author wrote that residents were
"upholstered in bright new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cut -- a
glaring and hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive puddles."

Twain's observation could apply to modern-day luminaries like Staley and Clark,
whose eloquent enunciation and pressed slacks contrast with the derelict
buildings and neglected lots right outside their door.

"Our numbers are growing. Will and I have always said that if two of us exist,
there has got to be 2,000 more people like us out there," Clark said. "We've
always had this mantra: Move to Helena."

Leadership is 'make-or-break thing'

Both Anniston and Helena-West Helena have histories of racial divisions, active
downtown districts and dysfunctional city governments. Earlier this summer,
Helena was several months overdue on its budget after the mayor vetoed several
versions.

Still, Helena-West Helena and Anniston are far from twins. For one, Helena is
significantly poorer, with a median family income of $23,274, compared to
Anniston's $36,067. Helena is also less populated and more isolated, lacking
nearby access to a major interstate.

And the Delta Bridge Project hasn't solved all the city's problems. Unemployment
in Phillips County stood at 11.5 percent in June, well above the state rate of
8.1 percent and up from 9 percent a year ago, according to the Arkansas
Department of Workforce Services. Even at the height of the pre-recession
economy, the lowest annual unemployment rate for Phillips County was 6.9
percent, though that came after four straight years of increasing employment.

Nevertheless, the town's revitalization may prove instructive for the Model
City. In many ways, it seems to be doing more with less.

Perhaps no one is more responsible for Helena's success than Doug Friedlander.
Friedlander, like Schuringa, first arrived in Helena as part of Teach for
America. Within two years, he had helped lead the effort to create the Boys and
Girls Club. He now serves as executive director of the county's Chamber of
Commerce.

"The make-or-break thing for the whole plan was leadership. You need good
leadership to design the plan, but also to execute it," Friedlander said,
adjusting his wire-rimmed glasses. "Health care is going to go nowhere,
education is going to go nowhere, economic development is going to go nowhere
without the right leadership."

With optimism and vigor, Friedlander commands a presence in the room. In between
trumpeting the value of leadership, he managed to both praise the waitress for a
good first day on the job and crack a few jokes about the soap opera projecting
from a nearby television.

The tale of Helena's renaissance involves people with competence, integrity and
vision getting off the sidelines and taking their responsibility as residents
seriously, he said.

Black acknowledged that Helena still has a long road ahead.

"This is still a poor community," he said. "The poverty rate is still 37
percent. We've reversed historical trends in certain program areas, but there's
still business as usual in others."

Friedlander noted that while the first step toward recovery may be the most
difficult, it is never too late to turn a town's fortunes around.

"You can keep mourning or start doing some CPR," he said. "It's not dead yet."

Health centers get oral health expertise

BYLINE: ERIK HOGSTROM TH staff writer ehogstrom@wcinet.com

SECTION: A; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 352 words


An oral health manager is bringing increased expertise to Iowa's community
health centers - including Crescent Community Health Center in Dubuque. Nancy
Adrianse's position is funded through a three-year grant from the Delta Dental
of Iowa Foundation to the Iowa Primary Care Association. "She is a support
person for all of the community health centers in Iowa," said Julie Woodyard,
Crescent's executive director.

"She's there to improve our practice in dental health. She will look at our
processes and see how we can do better - to help our quality." Adrianse
previously provided dental hygiene services at Primary Health Care Inc., a
community health center with clinic locations in Des Moines and Marshalltown.
She also helped to develop an oral health collaborative to raise awareness of
the importance of children receiving early dental visits. Adrianse also worked
for The Des Moines Health Center, a safety net dental clinic, where she helped
to develop and provide oral health education, screening, sealant and fluoride
varnish programs for children in Polk County schools. In her new role, Adrianse
can impart to the health centers the latest information from national resources
on oral health. "It's very good for us because we're delivering care to patients
and have little time to get ahead on the best practice stuff," Woodyard said.
Adrianse comes to the health centers courtesy of a $168,750 grant to the Iowa
Primary Care Association for its Community Health Center Capacity Building
Initiative for Oral Health. The number of dental patients in Iowa's 11 federally
qualified community health centers rose 42 percent from 2008 to 2010, to 48,942

El Paso County Family Youth Services Center ready to open doors

BYLINE: By Cindy Ramirez \ El Paso Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 657 words


After years of changing plans, budget cuts and construction hurdles, the
county's Family Youth Services Center is ready to open its doors to troubled and
emotionally disturbed residents and their families.

The $4.6 million, 21,110-square-foot center on Delta Drive near Ascarate Park
will hold its grand opening Tuesday, and will become the first of its kind in El
Paso County and one of the few statewide, officials said.

"This is a reflection of the community's commitment to provide care to our
families, especially in the mental health field," said Rita Ruelas, director of
the El Paso County Department of Mental Health Support Services.

The agency is one of many that will be housed at the center. Others include the
Juvenile Probation Department, University Medical Center, Emergence Health
Network, and satellite offices of the Domestic Relations Office, the 65th
District Family Drug Court Program and the County Attorney's Office. The
center's assessment hub will house psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists,
licensed social workers and chemical dependency counselors.

The Family Youth Services Center will treat children and adults and provide
prevention services, all aimed at keeping families together without duplication
of work among agencies.

"The concept is that you treat the entire family," Ruelas said. "You may have an
identified client -- maybe a young child having trouble in day care, an
adjudicated youth or a recently incarcerated parent who is being reintroduced
into the community -- but you treat the entire family and ensure the well-being
for everyone involved."

The center will work under a philosophy called "Systems of Care Wrap-Around," a
holistic approach where multiple agencies are housed in one place to better
serve families.

"Everybody is collaborating to provide services under one roof," Ruelas said.
"It's easier to access services, which is more convenient to the family. But
it's also more efficient for those who are providing the services because the
avenues for communication are increased."

The county has long struggled to stabilize its mental health programs,
restructuring and renaming its departments and programs in the past few years.

The Mental Health Support Services Department was formerly the Border Children's
Mental Health Collaborative, which started with a $9 million, seven-year federal
grant in 2002. When the grant ran out, the county stepped in to continue
offering mental health services to the community, but the collaborative soon
found itself embroiled in the public corruption investigation under its previous
leadership.

The department now serves about 1,000 people a year, including children who have
been identified as having behavioral problems, their siblings and parents.

Emergence Health Network was previously known as Mental Health and Mental
Retardation, which was renamed after federal law required that state agencies
replace the term "mental retardation" to "intellectual disability."

The name change also came when the organization was under scrutiny for lavish
travel spending by its former chief operating officer at a time when the agency
was financially strapped.

Emergence Health Network serves two distinct groups of individuals -- those with
a mental health diagnosis and those with intellectual disabilities.

El Paso's Emergence Health Network serves about 8,000 people a year.

The opening of the Family Youth Services Center, Ruelas said, is the next step
in improving mental health care countywide and overcoming the negative stigma
the county's mental health services had lived under.

"It's really exciting to be at this stage, finally," Ruelas said. "We will be
able to make such a difference in the lives of the families we serve."

WHO NEEDS TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE ANYWAY?

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. B-6

LENGTH: 1080 words


I want to express my enthusiasm for the mayor's current efforts to protect us
("City Wants More Cameras on Streets," April 2). It's good to know that we're
being monitored 24/7 by those who want to help.

I watch local TV and I read the Post-Gazette regularly, so I know that Western
Pennsylvania is a dangerous and scary place. My main concern is that 220 new
cameras don't seem to be nearly enough. Why not 3,000 new cameras, all hooked up
and centralized like those mentioned in the article? You can't be too safe!

My basement is not always illuminated and there are dark shadows in portions of
my stairwell to the second floor. I'd like to have electronic eyes installed by
the state to monitor these locations and also the inside of my car, where they
might stop a carjacking someday. We need to be protected from criminals and
terrorists.

Also, I'd like to praise Carnegie Mellon University for aiding police in their
efforts to fight crime. What I admire about CMU is its eager embrace of all
technology without wasting much time fretting over messy ethical issues like
privacy and individual American liberties. The more surveillance the better!
This is the sort of thing that more American universities should be doing.

Charter difference

The Pittsburgh Public Schools should be commended for many notable achievements
these past few years. The Pittsburgh Promise, the possibilities of the Gates
grant and new high school programs are a few of their positive accomplishments.

However, it is distressing that the Pittsburgh school system has been somewhat
negligent in one critical area. Despite the nationwide call for providing more
choice for students, the Pittsburgh schools have done everything possible to
prevent any type of real reform or any alternative for school choice other than
the choices that the district offers itself through magnet and open enrollment
programs. President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan have
expressed strong support for an expansion of charter schools and other choice
programs.

The Community Service Leadership Development Charter School ("Schools Chief
Criticizes Plan for Hazelwood Charter School," April 3) proposes an innovative
program in which student learning will be reinforced through ongoing leadership
development and community service projects. What an exciting way to make
learning relevant and meaningful to children! Formal instruction will be
provided in gender-based classrooms where attention is paid to the unique needs
of male and female students. Nowhere within the Pittsburgh Public Schools will
one find a program that attempts to reach students in this manner.

I urge interested citizens to write letters to school board members and to
testify at the next public hearing tomorrow to express their support for this
proposal and for charter schools in general. Let's work together to do whatever
it takes to best educate the children of Pittsburgh.

Altmire action

I continue to read letters about U.S. Rep. Jason Altmire's "no" vote on the
health care bill. In many, the writer encourages the reader to "remember this
act in November." What will you gain by voting Mr. Altmire out in November --
another Republican like Melissa Hart or, even worse, Mary Beth Buchanan?

If you're unhappy with Mr. Altmire, something must be done in the primaries in
May. November is too late. Is anyone out there considering a write-in campaign?

Delta to Paris

Regarding "Delta's Flight to Paris Not Taking Off Financially" (March 13): I was
initially thrilled when Delta announced nonstop service from Pittsburgh to
Paris, as I travel to Europe monthly. However, this good news quickly faded.

Delta consistently prices this flight at a premium, compared to not only other
carriers, but also to its own connection flights via Atlanta. I just compared
Delta's own fares online; it is $749 extra to take the nonstop!

Delta is using an older Boeing 757 narrow body jet on this route (as compared to
the wide-body aircraft that are more comfortable).

Charles de Gaulle in Paris is a more difficult airport to utilize compared with
other airports. Frequent travelers to Europe know this.

Delta recently completed its takeover of Northwest. They subsequently have
changed their routes and fares to encourage travel via the Atlanta hub.

One conclusion might be that Delta has no incentive to price the direct service
competitively, since the taxpayer will have to pay a guaranteed subsidy. A
logical question is whether Delta was guaranteed load, or was also guaranteed
profits.

Second, it is clear that other events have occurred since the original
agreement. The financial meltdown in America has forced various sectors to
renegotiate contracts. Has the airport authority reopened negotiations with
Delta yet?

I welcome nonstop service, but it must be a competitive product at a competitive
price.

Nonstop service, aggressively promoted to more than just the local market,
really will be good for Pittsburgh, our fellow taxpayers and the local economy.

Tiger's return

We all know about Tiger Woods' infidelity; he betrayed his wife not once but
many times over. If he hadn't been caught, he probably would be continuing his
infidelity.

His being welcomed back on the golf course by adoring fans -- as if nothing
happened -- reflects the values of our society today: that sports trump honor.

Get them out

Our nation seems to be on the verge of bankruptcy, but Democrats and Republicans
both spend more money than we have, and we keep re-electing them. Doesn't owing
$12.5 trillion matter? How can we spend $4 billion more each day than we take
in? How can we promise people benefits we can't possibly afford? It doesn't work
that way in my home or at the office; why should government be different?

Get Out of Our House (GOOOH) is an organization that is working to send 435
citizen representatives to Washington instead of career politicians, which
sounds like a great idea to me. It's time to really clean up the mess in
Washington once and for all.

The only way to do that is to replace all the politicians with one-term,
patriotic Americans who care about the future of our great nation and the
futures of our children.

$67 Million Awarded to Groups Helping With Health Law

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 605 words


WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Thursday awarded $67 million to 105
groups around the country that will serve as ''navigators'' to help the
uninsured understand their options under the new health care law and sign up for
coverage.

The administration had initially planned to spend less -- $54 million -- on
navigators in the 34 states where the federal government will run all or part of
new insurance markets created under the law. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, an official
with the Department of Health and Human Services, said the additional $13
million had come from a fund set up under the health law to pay for public
health and preventive care initiatives.

The administration has transferred several hundred million dollars from the fund
to pay for aspects of the law, drawing criticism from some members of Congress.

Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has said that she
had no choice but to tap the prevention fund because Congress refused to provide
money for outreach and education activities. The fund, originally $15 billion
over 10 years, is supposed to support wellness and disease-prevention programs
around the country.

Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who has championed the fund, said in May
that it was ''ill advised and shortsighted to raid the prevention fund, which is
making absolutely critical investments in preventing disease, saving lives, and
keeping women and their families healthy.''

The stakes are high for the navigator effort, because for the law to succeed,
millions of people, particularly the young and healthy, need to buy insurance
through the new markets. Many will qualify for federal subsidies to help with
the cost. But there will be wide discrepancies from state to state in spending
on navigators, and in how many people they can reach.

States building their own insurance markets will generally spend much more on
the effort than states that ceded the job to the federal government.

The 105 groups that were awarded navigator grants on Thursday include
universities, health clinics, hospital systems, church groups and health
advocacy groups. The grants range from $20,750 for Catholic Social Services, a
group in Mobile, Ala., to $5,889,181 for United Way of Tarrant County, which
serves the Fort Worth region in Texas but will help with enrollment around the
state.

Eight groups in Texas received a total of about $10.9 million, more than any
other state. Texas has one of the largest uninsured populations in the country,
about 27 percent of its residents, or six million people.

In Mississippi, Oak Hill Missionary Baptist Church Ministries will dispatch
clergy members as navigators in the state's Delta region. And in Maine, Fishing
Partnership Health Plan, which provides subsidized coverage to commercial
fishermen, will work with the Maine Lobstermen's Association to get the word out
about the new insurance market.

The groups will spend the coming weeks hiring and training navigators who will
then fan out across the 34 states, spreading the word about the new insurance
markets and, starting Oct. 1, helping the uninsured shop and sign up for
coverage. Navigators will be required to get at least 20 hours of training, then
pass a certification test.

''Navigators will be among the many resources available to help consumers
understand their coverage options in the marketplace,'' Ms. Sebelius said. ''A
network of volunteers on the ground in every state -- health care providers,
business leaders, faith leaders, community groups, advocates and local elected
officials -- can help spread the word and encourage their neighbors to get
enrolled.''

Get moving on cross-border integration

BYLINE: Kitty Poon

More than 480,000 Hongkongers are living in, or spending substantial periods of
time visiting, the mainland, according to a survey conducted by the Central
Policy Unit. Nearly 70 per cent of them are male, 59 per cent are between 30 and
59 years old - and many continue to enjoy Hong Kong's medical and welfare
services.

This implies that the city is on the verge of a brain drain and the depletion of
tax revenue without being able to reduce its welfare and health-care burdens.
This is a clear signal to policymakers that an immediate, and complete, revamp
is needed in their approach to Hong Kong's integration with the mainland.

True, 480,000 people is only a fraction of Hong Kong's total population of 6.8
million.  But it represents an exponential increase from the 61,000 and 41,000
people counted in similar surveys by the Planning Department last year and in
2001, respectively. Hong Kong's social integration with the mainland has been
unfolding at an astonishing speed, fuelled by the city's economic restructuring
and the region's increased economic co-operation.  This trend will pick up
momentum if, as expected, 160,000 Hongkongers move their home base across the
Lowu border in the next decade.

Despite this alarming pace of northward movement, the Hong Kong government holds
to its wait-and-see mode of thinking.  Cross-border issues were cited in only
two out of 30 public-policy topics proposed in a recent round of invitations for
research funding by the Research Grants Council.  Different research groups were
to be commissioned to study the issues of Hongkongers living on the mainland and
economic integration; while both those studies were treated as unrelated to
local issues of health-care financing, social security reform and manpower
needs.  Keeping such research separate suggests that the government has yet to
fully grasp the wide ramifications of the population movement.

The city's institutional framework is also ill-prepared for the foreseeable
social integration.  In his maiden policy address, Chief Executive Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen vowed to set up a Mainland Affairs Liaison Office overseeing all
mainland-related offices and units - including two that will be established in
Shanghai and Chengdu . But adding more liaison offices does not automatically
make the government more effective.

The existing economic and trade offices on the mainland, like their counterparts
overseas, primarily aim to promote Hong Kong's trade and commerce. However, this
has already become an obsolete mission on the mainland.

With the deepening of co-operation in the Pearl River Delta region, what is most
wanted from the government is effort to relieve the pain resulting from economic
integration - difficulties encountered by those who move north, and losses
incurred in the local community.

For example, could the government help to establish clinics for Hongkongers, or
enable them to use high-quality medical facilities, in their new locations?
Could it ensure Hongkongers' access to social security benefits in the future,
easing any difficulties of paying into the scheme while they work on the
mainland?  Such efforts require co-ordination and co-regulation with provincial
and city authorities in the mainland.

It is time to adopt an integrated approach to Hong Kong's social integration
with the mainland, and to think about developing intergovernmental relations
horizontally. It would serve Hongkongers' interests if governments in the delta
region acted together to manage the population movement within the region.

From Paul Osuyi, Asaba

On May 21, 2013, Favour Okiemute was not so favoured. She gave up the ghost
after a three-year battle with tuberculosis. The disease had reduced her to mere
vegetable, as efforts by medics to rescue the 25-year old lady from the pangs of
death failed.

Prior to contracting the disease in 2010, the graduate of Microbiology from the
University of Lagos was the envy of all in her hometown of Sapele, Delta State.
After graduation in 2011, Favour had her youth service in Benin City where she
was diagnosed of tuberculosis.

The disease affected her drastically. Medical personnel battled to rescue her by
applying all known medications and referred her to several centres. But the
efforts to save her life did not yield any good result until she passed on.

Favour is not the first patient to have died of the ravaging disease, and would
probably not be the last, particularly in rural communities where access to
medical facilities is a major challenge in Nigeria. The case of Mercy Ojonogo, a
fresh Linguistic graduate from the University of Benin, readily comes to mind.

Narrating how the ailment started, Mercy, who is awaiting mobilisation for the
mandatory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) said: "I was working on some
projects and conducting research when I took ill. School wasn't in session and I
wanted to make some extra preparations for the next semester before I discovered
the disease. That was in May 2014 when I was in my final year.

"I had been to the Central Hospital, Warri. Then I was referred to one closer to
my home. I also went for some private checks to double-check what the government
hospitals were saying; just to be sure. In all these movements, the experiences
were not interesting."

She, however, expressed optimism that she would get back to her feet soon. She
commended doctors at the Eku Referral Hospital, saying "the workers are
committed to their work. They have listening ears and are ready to help out as
much as they can."

John Osioni, a 21-year student of Delta School of Health Technology, Ughelli,
discovered he had tuberculosis between 2012 and 2013 when he was in Senior
Secondary School III. According to him, it started with coughing and fever, but
he was treating malaria.

"We later discovered and started treating the tuberculosis. Where I was
receiving treatment, the lady observed that the sickness was not going and,
therefore, recommended that I go for tuberculosis test and it was positive. And
so, for the past five years, we have been on it.

"Ever since, it has been weighing me down. I have chest pain, back pain and pain
in all the joints. Everywhere is hurting me. I have stopped schooling. I
deferred the admission because of the pains. We were about to resume Year Two
when the thing weighed me down and I couldn't continue. And so, last year in
July, I had to stop school to concentrate on the treatment. And by the grace of
God, I am getting better," he said.

But 40-year old Donald Ebie from Agbarho has more bitter tales. Although he
appears hopeless, following his narrative, he seems not to be aware of the
situation, surrounding his health. Ebie, who works as an accountant in a finance
company, is depending on the grace of God to survive the trauma. He discovered
the disease in 2012 and had visited several hospitals both in Delta and Edo
States. But respite appears far away from him.

"I have been to Central Hospital, Sapele, twice for treatment. When it couldn't
work, I left for Edo State where I was admitted at Ogan Hospital and I stayed
there for almost four months.

"After certifying me okay, I was still coughing but the doctor said I was okay
and that they had done all they could for me. I said I was not sure going by the
way I was feeling. It was then they referred me to Eku to continue with the
treatment.

"My experiences have been terrible. I could not walk a long distance; even to
take my bath was a problem for me. I coughed a lot and yellow sputum was coming
out of my mouth," he explained.

He said the doctors at the Eku Referral Centre told him that he had received all
the treatment he needed to receive but was only asked to wait for a class of
experts to see what could be done for him, as his case was not improving.

Eku, a semi-urban community in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State
is host to the state government-owned Tuberculosis and leprosy referral centre.
Confirmed cases of the two diseases are referred to the isolated environment for
treatment.

However, Mr. Chiedozie Onyeukwu, Executive Director of Krucial Aid Nigeria, a
non-governmental organisation, working with foreign donors to alleviate the
pains of tuberculosis patients, said as the disease repelled people, so is the
road to the centre repellent, nauseating and disgusting.

Mr. Onyeukwu, under whose organisation - the Global Fund - is assisting the
tuberculosis patients in the state, said his organisation had battled to ensure
that the disease is eradicated from communities in the state.

At a sensitisation workshop in Eku for over 40 drug resistant tuberculosis
(DR-TB) patients and their treatment supporters, with the aim of treating,
preventing and controlling tuberculosis, Onyeukwu explained that the fight had
been both successful and challenging.

He said his organisation had experienced certain challenges, which ranged from
treatment default and absconding, drug side effects (loss of hearing), treatment
failure, while most complicated cases have led to death among patients even
after fortunes from donor agencies.

"We have continuously ensured that patients do not stop the treatment before it
is completed, allowing the bacteria to mutate and move from the ordinary
susceptible stage to the drug resistant stage.

"We have tried to monitor them so that they do not default and go down with more
severe tuberculosis which is more difficult to treat, requiring, on the average,
two years of medication. We call on Nigerians to join in the fight to eliminate
tuberculosis," Onyeukwu said.

He further explained that Krucial Aid Nigeria, a sub-sub recipient and Health
Alive Foundation (HAF), another sub recipient of the Global Fund Round 9
Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) Grant, which assists Nigeria to
strengthen multi drug resistance tuberculosis prevention and control in Nigeria,
has the objective of promoting behavioural change about tuberculosis in
communities and strengthen tuberculosis prevention and control in Nigeria.

Deputy Control Officer of the State Tuberculosis Programme and Medical Director,
Tuberculosis and Leprosy Referral Centre, Dr. Alexander Akpodiete, said no fewer
than 500,000 people are affected by tuberculosis every year in Nigeria with only
100,000 infected persons finding access to health care facilities.

He said in Delta, there are estimated cases of 15,000 patients per year, noting
that only between 2,500 and 3000 are available for treatment annually.

Akpodiete noted that Nigeria ranks 10th among the 22 high burden tuberculosis
countries globally, adding that though the World Health Organization (WHO) has
declared the disease a global emergency, it has remained one of the world's
major cause of ill-health and death.

Senior Programme Officer of Community Medicine Department of the Institute of
Human Virology Nigeria (IHVN) Mrs. Meg Ike, said tuberculosis could actually be
cured within six months.

She said the poor attitude of Nigerians to health management leads to
tuberculosis patients graduating from the initial susceptible stage to the drug
resistant stage which might lead to another stage where the disease remains
absolutely incurable.

SORORITY LEADERS SHARE A SCHOOL

DATELINE: TAMPA



HIGHLIGHT: The vice presidents of two women's groups hope to use their influence
throughout the area.


With more than 400,000 members between them, Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma
Theta are two of the biggest, most influential organizations for
African-American women.

Their rosters read like a global who's who: first lady Michelle Obama, Liberian
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm and former
U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun.

Now, for the first time either sorority can think of, the top lieutenants who
help set the agendas of these century-old service groups are based in Tampa and
have ties to the University of South Florida.

And today, they will be feted during a scholarship benefit and luncheon at USF.

"One city and one university have two of the highest-ranking women in the two
largest sororities in the world - not just the country, but the world," said
former state Sen. Les Miller, USF's director of community relations and one of
the luncheon's organizers. "We just thought that was history-making."

Carolyn House Stewart, AKA's first vice president, lives in Thonotosassa and is
a 1974 USF alumna.

Her Delta counterpart, Paulette Walker, lives in Valrico and is the College of
Education's director of undergraduate programs and internship.

"Of all the places that this could have happened," asked Walker, a native of
Detroit, "how and why was it Tampa?"

Stewart, a shareholder in the law firm of Macfarlane Ferguson & McMullen,
recalls when there were fewer than 400 African-American students on campus and
even fewer professors of color.

Walker, who moved to Tampa in 1990, remembers when women and minorities were
denied tenured faculty positions at USF.

The demographics of the university and the city are changing and are growing the
harvest of untapped future black leaders, they said.

"Perhaps with Paulette's role and my role, we will open up to the world that
Tampa is a city of opportunity, a city that supports excellence and a city that
nurtures and encourages leadership of those who have the capacity for
compassion, caring and uplifting the world community," said Stewart, who will be
installed as AKA's international president in 2010.

While both women said they are focused on their current roles, Walker said she
hopes they can collaborate on some initiatives.

"Imagine a think tank or a symposium on health care," she said. "Just imagine
the impact we would have."

Electronic records coming to Mississippi

BYLINE: Lynn Lofton

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 777  words


Electronic medical records will be required for health care providers under
federal healthcare reform. Mississippi, however, has a head start because the
State Health Information Exchange was established for that purpose by Gov. Haley
Barbour after Hurricane Katrina. This task force established electronic
healthcare records in the six coastal counties so that important medical records
would not again be lost in storms.

Dr. James S. McIlwain serves as co-chair of the Mississippi Healthcare
Information Technology Infrastructure Task Force and feels the state is ready to
move forward with this federal mandate.

"We want to try to enhance the quality of care in our state, and this is one way
to do it. With electronic records, our physicians can make better decisions and
we're champions of this. With the exchange on the Coast, we got ahead of the
rest of the county. The coastal exchange has been so successful. We get rave
reviews on it and will use it as a platform," he said.

The state received $10.3 million in federal funds, with the Governor's Office in
charge of running the strategy part of the exchange. Once federal approval is
received, McIlwain said the program will start statewide.

He says Coast providers are big supporters of the electronic records system.
"We all remember the horror of seeing Coast doctors trying to dry out wet
medical records by spreading them out in their driveways after Katrina,"
McIlwain said. "We do not ever want that to happen again. "

As for the expenses to individual healthcare providers, he says federal funding
will help with the initial connections, but won't be a tremendous help to
everyone. "But it's like paying for utilities," he added. "Those who use it will
pay for it. With the funding we have, we'll be able to connect everybody; that
is physicians, hospitals and nurse practitioners. We're trying to keep it as
cheap as possible. "

He estimates the cost to a small medical clinic will be from $20,000 to $25,000
and notes some clinics are merging to further allay costs. In addition to funds
received by the state for implementing the program, McIlwain points out that
other incentive funds are available through Medicaid and Medicare.

The Delta Health Alliance was awarded a grant of $14.4 million, which will pay
for a number of primary care physicians in that area to be connected to the
exchange over three years.

"There are a lot of vendors selling these systems, and we have about 30 in
Mississippi," he said. "The task force is trying to help our healthcare
providers understand the systems. "

Medical clinics, he points out, will not need full-time IT employees or
expensive equipment to be part of the system. "Most of the work is done by
vendors, and the new technology is very easy to use. Hospitals are more
complicated and most of them have their own IT people anyway," he added.

A Louisiana company, eQHealth, was selected by the federal government to assist
primary care physicians in Mississippi with implementing this new technology at
little or no cost. Additionally, incentives between $44,000 and $64,000 are
available to be paid in increments over five years to providers in small primary
care practices.

This company serves as a Regional Extension Center for Health Information
Technology in Mississippi. With this designation, eQHealth will provide
technical consultants to work with individual providers who are ready to add an
electronic health record system to their practice. The company's consultants can
also assist physicians and hospitals with meeting the criteria necessary to
qualify for federal funding.

"Our staff will help doctors and clinics implement an electronic health record
system the right way," said Randy Bordelon, project manager of the Regional
Extension Center. "The assistance is designed to make sure the system works for
each practice with as little disruption as possible. We help the staffs of
clinics and small hospitals through each step so the new tool is adopted as
easily and efficiently as possible. "

McIlwain says younger physicians are coming out of training with knowledge about
electronic records and embrace it. Although there may be some resistance from
older practitioners, he feels they will accept the new technology.

"They know it's coming and are concerned, but they definitely want it," he said.
"Just like the physicians on the Coast who've gotten used to it and love it,
others will, too. It really increases productivity and makes healthcare better.
"

With a laugh, he predicts that very few physicians will retire because they
don't want to implement electronic medical records. "That won't happen. Doctors
and preachers don't retire. "

Aug. 24--Pueblo Community Health Center has been awarded a $50,000 grant from
the Caring for Colorado Foundation for pediatric dental services through the
foundation's Cavity Free by Three program.

The program is a three-year, statewide effort to prevent oral disease in young
children, according to foundation spokeswoman Linda Reiner.

PCHC will receive a $10,000 cash award and technical assistance valued at
$40,000.

The cash can be used for any purpose related to providing dental care to babies
and education to their parents.

The technical assistance package includes: On-site training of PCHC staff about
prenatal and infant oral care protocols. The training will be conducted by Dr.
John Westfall, a family physician and the associate dean of rural health at the
University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Annie Gibbs, a registered dental
hygienist who works at High Plains Community Health Center in Lamar.

Patient education materials.

Physician and dentist materials, including risk assessment forms and clinical
guidelines.

Infant oral care kits that contain all of the supplies needed to conduct an
infant oral-care exam.

The health center is one of 10 recipients totaling $100,000 in cash and $500,000
in technical assistance.

Caring for Colorado Foundation, The Colorado Health Foundation, The Colorado
Trust, Delta Dental of Colorado Foundation, Kaiser Permanente and Rose Community
Foundation are jointly funding Cavity Free at Three.

Dental disease is the number one disease of childhood, but it is preventable.

The aim of Cavity Free at Three is to make dental disease in children rare
instead of inevitable.

The project primarily aims to:

Provide training for health care providers about how to incorporate an oral
health risk assessment, parent education and fluoride applications for young
children into their services.

Work to ensure that all children have a regular source of dental care starting
at age 1.

Address the oral health needs of pregnant women and provide them with extra
education about how to care for their infant's teeth.

SPDC Trains 300 Midwives in Niger Delta

BYLINE: Chioma Obinna

LENGTH: 405 words


Healthcare delivery in six Niger Delta states looks set for the upswing with the
training of 300 midwives that will support government's effort in getting more
skilled health workers to rural communities.

The 18-month midwifery certification training which commenced in 2014 aims to
produce skilled and motivated change agents in the hinterland, where statistics
show that 45 percent of women are delivered of their babies with the help of
unskilled birth attendants, thereby increasing the risk of maternal and infant
mortality in such areas.

The initiative is sponsored by the Shell Petroleum Development of Nigeria Ltd.,
SPDC, Joint Venture in collaboration with the governments of Rivers, Bayelsa,
Delta, Imo, Abia and Akwa Ibom states and New Partnership for Africa
Development, NEPAD. "This is a unique intervention that invests not only in the
individual beneficiaries but also in the people hoping to benefit from their
newly acquired skills," SPDC's acting Regional Community Health Manager, Dr.
Akinwumi Fajola, said at a cheque-presentation ceremony in Port Harcourt.

"The training is in line with SPDC's commitment to improving healthcare in rural
areas and will make the much-needed difference in hard-to-reach locations in the
Delta."

SPDC's acting HoD, Partnership and Collaboration, Dr. Dennis Oyakhire, said, "In
2014, the beneficiaries received the first instalment of the scholarship fund
and today we are happy to be presenting the second (and final) cheques to them.
We are all looking forward to enjoying the benefits of this initiative." The
Director of Nursing Services, Abia State Ministry of Health, Pastor Ekeagba
Promise acknowleged the training of the midwives.

As part of the programme, the 300 trainees are studying in accredited state
schools of midwifery and also sent on clinical attachments in community
hospitals, in preparation for the final qualifying examination of the Nigerian
Nursing and Midwifery Council. SPDC has provided them with modern laptops to
facilitate research and documentation.

Faith Emerho, one of the beneficiaries from the Delta State School of Nursing,
Sapele, said, "I was struggling through school; combining school with work until
SPDC provided finances that enabled me resume my studies. I promise to be an
agent of change in my community." Faith and the other midwives are expected to
graduate this year and return to their communities to provide professional
medical care.

Oakley hopes to develop youth programs;
City invites teens to join group that will help decide best way to implement
grant of $150,000

BYLINE: Paula King, STAFF WRITER

Recognizing that youths are Oakley's single largest population group, making up
at least 20 percent of residents, the city is working toward providing more
recreational and social programs for them.

Armed with a $150,000 grant from the Vesper Society, recreation leaders are
partnering with local adolescents to create an Oakley Youth Master Plan that
would map out future teen services and programs. Recreation program coordinator
Denis Nishihara said they are calling it a youth empowerment program because it
is designed to support and empower local young people.

The programs likely will focus on sharpening their skills and fostering
self-respect, integrity and honesty, according to Nishihara. It also will build
on young people's relationships with their schools, parents and community.

"We are showing them that the city of Oakley actually values them as people,"
Nishihara said. "If you are willing to invest into your community, your
community is willing to invest into you."

The city has hired senior recreation leader Regan Hoffner to focus on youth
development programs and help the Oakley Youth Advisory Council with drafting
the master plan. Right now, Hoffner is trying to fill the council and survey
local middle and high school students on what types of programs they would like
to see in Oakley.

In the meantime, the city is trying to offer more youth-oriented programs such
as movies and concerts in the park. Hoffner said the city would like to sponsor
a youth conference or retreat for Oakley kids.

From a recreation center to classes, Hoffner said the plan will narrow down the
types of programs that youths appreciate. The plan will focus on young people
ages 12-18, according to Hoffner.

"It is all about what Oakley needs and wants," Hoffner said. "We are trying to
create our mission statement. We are doing research on different cities to see
what they have, from more art classes to teen classes with parents. It is a huge
array and we are trying to narrow it down."

According to Nishihara, other cities that have youth master plans include Los
Angeles, Vacaville and Pleasanton.

With resources such as the Delta, open space, trails and strong partnerships
with other agencies, Nishihara said Oakley could capitalize more on what is in
its back yard. For instance, jet skiing or canoeing programs on the water might
be offered.

As a San Francisco based nonprofit organization since 1985, Vesper has focused
on adolescent health by allocating more than $75 million to health care
projects, including Sutter Delta Hospital's Urgent Care Clinic and Hayward's
Adolescent Health Consortium. It also started the Search Institute's Forty
Developmental Assets for youth, which has been utilized by several communities.

"The Vesper Society has done great things," Nishihara said. "They are strongly
invested into creating strong communities for young people."

Local youth interested in participating with the Oakley Youth Master Plan,
should share their comments or concerns with the city's Parks and Recreation
Department or the Oakley Youth Advisory Council, by calling senior recreation
leader Regan Hoffner at 925-625-7046. Teens are also encouraged to apply for
open seats on the OYAC or attend its next meeting on Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. For more
information, call 925-625-7041.

                           December 19, 2006 Tuesday

Briefs: Delta bid may be raised

LENGTH: 1365 words


US Airways is willing to increase its $8.4 billion bid for Delta Air Lines Inc.
if Delta can justify that it is worth more, an official with knowledge of US
Airways' plans said Monday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivity of the talks, said US Airways first needs to see how
much Atlanta-based Delta values itself at in its reorganization plan, which it
could file with the bankruptcy court as early as Tuesday, and whether any other
airline makes a bid for Delta. US Airways is eager to get a look at Delta's
books to analyze how much if at all to increase the unsolicited offer, which was
first disclosed Nov. 15, the official said. A Delta spokeswoman declined to
comment Monday on the timing of when Delta will file its reorganization plan,
which some observers believe could value Delta at more than US Airways' current
offer. Tempe, Ariz.-based US Airways Group Inc. has always "anticipated" the
possibility of having to increase its offer and was not trying to buy Delta Air
Lines Inc. "on the cheap," the official said.

Brewer's financing opposed

Two Pittsburgh Brewing Co. creditors, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade
Bureau and the MeadWestvaco Packaging Systems, are opposing the bankrupt
brewery's plans for interim financing in the form of a line of credit up to
$500,000, according to documents filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Pittsburgh. The tax and trade bureau said Pittsburgh Brewing is proposing to
give a new, unidentified investor priority over the bureau's claim for payments
of almost $815,000 in excise taxes. The bureau said it would withdraw its
objection if it was paid $49,130 and the brewery posted a bond covering its
excise taxes. MeadWestvaco, of Glen Allen, Va., said the brewery has not
revealed if the financing will pay the bill it owes for leasing the company's
packaging equipment. The brewery has said it needs the interim financing to pay
current operating expenses. A hearing on the financing issue is scheduled for
Thursday.

UAW mulls concessions

United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said the union may grant
health-care concessions to DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler unit after reviewing
the automaker's finances. Gettelfinger, speaking in an interview on Detroit
radio station WJR, said the company's books are being examined by union
representatives. Chrysler wants hourly workers to accept reduced health
benefits, concessions that workers at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
made in 2005. The union said in September that it wouldn't agree to pay more for
health care because Chrysler's woes weren't as severe as those at Ford or GM.
Since then, Chrysler posted a $1.5 billion loss in the third quarter and the
Stuttgart, Germany-based parent company said earnings this year would fall short
of analysts' estimates.

Scrubber cost deal

Allegheny Energy Inc. has reached agreement with interested parties regarding
financing of the $550 million project to install flue gas desulfurization
(scrubber) equipment at its Fort Martin power plant in West Virginia. The
parties asked the Public Service Commission of West Virginia to authorize the
sale of up to $450 million in bonds to cover costs, up from the
Commission-authorized $338 million previously approved. Allegheny Energy would
retain the right to seek recovery of construction costs exceeding $450 million
through its West Virginia customer rate base. The bonds sold will be repaid
through a customer surcharge, resulting in what Allegheny Energy called
"substantial savings" rather than including recovery via traditional higher
rates. The Fort Martin project is expected to be in service by year-end 2009.

Realty deal approved

Shareholders of Trammell Crow Co. on Monday approved an offer by CB Richard
Ellis Inc. of El Segundo, Calif., to buy the Dallas-based real estate
development firm for almost $1.8 billion. Shareholders of Trammell Crow will get
$49.51 in cash for each share of stock they own. CB Richard Ellis, the world's
largest commercial real estate services company, has a Downtown office and
Trammell Crow has an office in Cranberry. The deal, which is expected to close
later this month, should have no impact on local operations, a CB Richard Ellis
spokesman said previously.

Dominion eyes wind power

Dominion Resources Inc. has purchased a 50 percent stake in a West Virginia wind
turbine project that is the subject of a case before the that state's Supreme
Court. Virginia-based Dominion, one of the nation's largest energy producers,
announced Monday it plans to develop the first phase of a 200-turbine wind farm
near Mount Storm, W.Va., a project that some residents are trying to block. In a
news release, Dominion said the $300 million project gives the company an
opportunity to increase its renewable energy portfolio. The facility is to be
built near Dominion's coal-fired Mount Storm Power Station.

Ford to sell 2 plants

Ford Motor Co., the second-largest U.S. automaker, agreed to sell two more parts
plants taken back last year in its rescue of former subsidiary Visteon Corp.
Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. will buy a fuel rail factory in El Jarudo,
Mexico, that employs about 500 people, and Flex-N-Gate will buy a Milan, Mich.,
plant that makes fuel tanks and automotive trim, Ford said today. The plants are
part of Ford's Automotive Components Holdings unit. Terms weren't disclosed. The
sales are the second and third this month of former Visteon businesses as
Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford works to dispose of 23 plants and offices by 2008.
Once Ford completes the announced plans to sell or close ACH plants, it will
have seven U.S. and two Mexico locations to divest or shut down.

Google buys Endoxon

Google Inc., the most-used Internet search engine, bought Swiss company Endoxon
to add features to its Internet maps program and Web sites in Europe. The
purchase included Endoxon's Internet, maps and data processing units, Mountain
View, California-based Google said today on its Web site. Terms weren't
disclosed. Endoxon, based in Lucerne and founded in 1988, makes software for
displaying digital maps on computers and mobile phones. It also has software for
overlaying geographic data on maps. Google, Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are
developing their online maps services to attract more users and local businesses
seeking to reach them.

China deal set

SunGard Data Systems Inc. on Monday announced its acquisition of Shanghai Fudan
Kingstar Computer Co., a deal that reflects how foreign technology companies are
moving to take advantage of growth and liberalization in China's financial
system. SunGard, a software services company based in Wayne, Delaware County,
said that Kingstar represents its most significant effort to gain a foothold in
China. The company previously had a representative office in China and also has
subsidiaries that carry out a small amount of business in the country.
Shanghai-based Kingstar sells a range of software products in China, including
the country's major bond market and gold market trading-and-information systems.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Other business news

Sara Lee Corp., the maker of Kiwi shoe polish and its namesake cakes, hired Tom
Hansson as chief of worldwide strategic planning to help spur growth following a
corporate restructuring completed earlier this year. Hansson, 46, joins Sara Lee
as senior vice president of strategy and corporate development from
consulting-firm Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., where he was a U.S.-based lead partner
in the strategic leadership practice, Sara Lee said Monday in a statement.

FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, Ohio, has signed a long-term agreement with PPM
Energy to purchase the power output of Somerset County's $61 million Casselman
Wind Power project. Located near the towns of Meyersdale and Rockwood, the wind
farm's 23 turbines will produce 34.5 megawatts of power, enough electricity to
power about 10,350 homes. The project is slated for completion at the end of
2007.

Pittsburgh-area stocks fell Monday. The Bloomberg Pittsburgh Index, a
price-weighted list of companies with operations in the region, fell 2.61 to
324.19.

Medicaid spat could cost millions State reimbursement rates too low, HMO says

BYLINE: By Marsha Austin, Denver Post Business Writer,

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D-01

LENGTH: 838 words


A dispute between Rocky Mountain HMO and state officials  over Medicaid payments
could cost Colorado hospitals and taxpayers  millions of dollars, some health
care executives fear.

Jim Rizzuto, Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and  Financing director,
said last month the state would drop Rocky  Mountain, the largest HMO on the
Western Slope, from its Medicaid  managed care program Jan. 1 after the two
failed to reach an  agreement on reimbursement rates for 2001. Colorado pays
Medicaid  HMOs including Rocky Mountain 95 percent of what it estimates is  the
cost of treating Medicaid patients who aren't in HMOs. The  state paid Rocky
Mountain $ 60 million during fiscal year 1999 -  but would have to pay an
estimated $ 3 million more if the HMO's  Medicaid coverage is dropped next year,
forcing members into  fee-for-service care, said Bernie Buescher, former
director of the  Department of Health Care Policy and Financing and a board
member  of St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction.

He said hospitals from Grand Junction to Denver could lose  much more.

'If it falls apart now they'll (hospitals) get paid less,' he  said. 'And a lot
of these folks, if they fall into  fee-for-service, will end up in ER's, the
most expensive part of  the health care system.'

Rocky Mountain chief executive officer Mike Weber has  questioned the accuracy
of the state's proposed payments to  Medicaid HMOs, complaining that they are
too low.

Rizzuto said the rates are accurate and sufficient and the  state shouldn't be
bullied by HMOs to raise them.

He said HMOs may not be the best way to trim Colorado's  burgeoning Medicaid
budget and get quality health care to  low-income residents. The Health Care
Policy and Financing  Department has worked diligently to cut costs in the
fee-for-service program and the state is considering alternatives  such as
giving counties block grants of Medicaid money to manage  on their own and
awarding vouchers directly to Medicaid members  who would purchase commercial
health insurance, he said.

'HMOs weren't the silver bullet,' said Rizzuto. 'We are  really at a critical
time where we have to go back and analyze  them. I think it's time to look at
the cost increases in  fee-for-service and the cost increases in HMOs.'

A federal judge has temporarily stopped the state from  dropping Rocky Mountain
from its Medicaid program until Monday.

In the meantime, the court is evaluating the state's 2001  Medicaid rates to
determine whether they are legal.

Weber has said he will fight to keep Rocky Mountain's 24,000  Medicaid HMO
members from being forced back to Medicaid's  traditional fee-for-service plan,
which lacks preventive health  programs such as prenatal care, cholesterol
screenings and  diabetes management.

But the state's reimbursement rates are $ 3 million to $ 6  million below what
it will cost Rocky Mountain to provide medical  care to Medicaid patients,
making it difficult for the HMO to  remain in the program, Weber has said.

Medicaid is a health benefits program for low-income and  disabled individuals
funded jointly by federal and state funds.

St. Mary's, Delta County Memorial Hospital and Montrose  Memorial Hospital on
Colorado's Western Slope treat large numbers  of Rocky Mountain Medicaid HMO
patients.

Buescher estimates St.  Mary's alone stands to lose $ 2 million to $ 3 million
if Rocky  Mountain drops out of the Medicaid program because the HMO pays  the
hospital at a higher rate than the government does under its  fee-for-service
program.

In addition, Medicaid patients who lose  their primary care doctor are likely to
show up in the emergency  room with untreated illnesses, a costly alternative
for hospitals,  he said.

About half of Rocky Mountain's Medicaid HMO members  across Colorado see primary
care doctors who don't accept  traditional Medicaid patients, and would have to
find new doctors  if Rocky Mountain exits the market, Weber said.

HMOs save money  by encouraging Medicaid patients to see their family doctors
frequently and thus catch injuries and illnesses early, before  they turn into
expensive hospital stays. The health plans can then  pass those savings on to
hospitals and doctors by paying them more  than traditional Medicaid, said Len
Dryer, chief financial officer  at The Children's Hospital in Denver. One-third
of Children's  patients are Medicaid beneficiaries. 'If the state keeps cutting
  Medicaid dollars to hospitals, I think we'll be a lot worse off in  the long
run' without Medicaid HMOs, said Dryer.

Hospital  executives on the Western Slope also are concerned about Medicaid
patients losing their HMO. 'Our biggest concern is that if the  plan changes
dramatically and our physicians decide not to  participate, Medicaid patients
are going to show up in the ER,'  said Ken Platou, CEO of Montrose Memorial
Hospital.

HEARING PLANNED ON CHICKEN CODE: The City Council will decide whether to make
chickens more available to residents at a public hearing Jan. 26.

The city's Planning Commission recently debated a proposal to relax the
municipal code that currently prohibits residents from keeping any chickens on
residentially zoned lots smaller than 20,000 square feet.

The board had been considering whether to allow people to keep up to three hens
roosters will remain off-limits   either on lots of 6,000 or 10,000 square feet.

Planning commissioners differed on the issue, and on Jan. 5 voted 3-2 to
recommend that the City Council change the rules to allow chickens on lots that
are at least 10,000 square feet. The recommendation also specifies that chicken
coops should be at least 10 feet from the property line.

The vote contradicted the wishes of some residents who had e-mailed planning
commissioners in the days leading up to the vote to oppose changing the rules.

At the meeting itself, speakers from the audience were divided, with several
urging the city to give people more latitude to raise chickens in their
backyards.

DEADLINE NEARS FOR GRANT PROGRAM: Time is running out to apply to the city's
Agricultural Enterprise Grant Program. The deadline is Feb. 1 for individuals
who want money to help promote the area's agriculture in a way that will draw
visitors to Brentwood.

Approximately $18,500 is available in grants to fund marketing efforts in
2010-11; that figure is half the amount the city offered this year because the
economy has driven down interest rates, which are used to calculate how much
will be available in any given year.

Established three years ago with revenue from developer fees, the grant program
this year helped fund the creation of a map depicting all the farms that sell
produce directly to the public during their harvest season. Money also went to a
downtown wine store that used it to plug wine tastings featuring local grape
growers.

Grant recipients will be announced in March.

Application forms can be downloaded from the city's Web site at
www.ci.brentwood.ca.us . Click on the Economic Development Department link and
then look under "Programs & Resources."

UPS plans 2-for-1 split of internal stock

United Parcel Service plans a 2-for-1 split of its employee-owned stock,
apparently in order to lower the price prior to a planned public offering of 10
percent of the shares. The Sandy Springs-based delivery giant disclosed the move
in a pre-offering regulatory filing. A UPS spokesman declined to comment, but
the move appears aimed at halving the per-share price to make the public
offering more attractive. The company said in the filing it expects to launch
the offering in November. No target share price has been set, but UPS stock is
currently valued internally at $ 51 a share, and the company could seek more in
the offering. A split would cut that price in half, and also double the number
of shares to be offered from 55 million to 110 million. Shareholders will be
asked to approve the move at a special meeting in October.


ATLANTA: Delta launches sale to boost fall bookings
Delta Air Lines is launching a fall fare sale to most domestic and selected
European destinations. The Atlanta-based carrier's move is aimed at boosting
non-holiday fall and early winter bookings, and it follows similar sales by
rival AirTran. Under the Delta sale, bookings must be made by Oct. 1 for travel
between Oct. 5 and Dec. 15, with peak holiday travel dates blacked out.  Sample
sale fares include $ 138 round trip to Boston, $ 378 to Portland, Ore. , and $
460 to Madrid, Spain.

TECHNOLOGY: Home Depot picks AT&T for $ 100 million deal
Home Depot Inc. awarded AT&T Corp. a three-year network services contract valued
at more than $ 100 million, AT&T said. The company said that under the
agreement, it will provide the Vinings-based home improvement retailer with
integrated network connection service, or INCS, as well as voice and frame relay
services. The telecommunications giant said INCS uses bandwidth technology to
increase a network's capacity for voice calls. Home Depot already uses INCS in
more than 30 of its stores and expects to install it in all of its more than 300
stores by mid-
2000.

Per-Se to settle dispute with Foundation Health
Per-Se Technologies Inc. said the company has signed an agreement to settle a
legal dispute with Foundation Health Systems Inc. The settlement provides for
Foundation to realize $ 16.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of Per- Se
common stock. Per-Se expects to issue to Foundation and register with the
Securities and Exchange Commission 6.2 million shares as part of the settlement.
Any unsold shares or excess proceeds will be returned to Per-Se. In exchange,
Foundation will terminate ongoing litigation and grant a general release to
Per-Se. Vinings-based Per-Se, formerly Medaphis Corp., provides Internet and
other services to doctors and health care organizations.

Volunteers always welcome at Sutter Delta

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 747 words


Recently I met with Christine Green of Sutter Delta Medical Center's human
resources department and Stacy Vaillancourt, director of strategy and business
development for the hospital.

Green has been with Sutter Delta since January and began working with the
hospital auxiliary in February. With a background of 20 years in human
resources, Green was previously with St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco and
has "grown up in the human resources world." As a "neutral third party," she
deals with both the employee and the employer, as well as with the employer and
the union.

Human resources is a unique challenge and often involves coping with emotional
and social strain. Sutter Delta's auxiliary is a self-functioning volunteer
unit. Green said the members have a "good sense of what needs to be done." The
auxiliary has "grown with the community and become more aligned with the
strategy of the organization," she said.

Advocating the auxiliary is part of Green's job. More programs are needed now
that there is a more diverse group of employees within the facility.

"We take them (the volunteers) for granted. ... They go quietly about their
work," she said.

An attempt is made, Green went on, to find a volunteer slot for everyone who
comes forward.

Vaillancourt added that they "recognize they're a part of the work force, and
take ownership of whatever job they do." She said that many people want to give
back to Sutter Delta. It's an "icon ... a cornerstone of the community."

Volunteers play a huge role in the organization. They are, Vaillancourt said,
"its legs."

"They put out word of improvements in the medical center," she said.

One function of the auxiliary is to issue $500 scholarships to students. These
can be applied toward training in pharmacy technician and phlebotomy programs,
not just toward four-year institutions.

These scholarships will continue to be offered on an annual basis. Vaillancourt
said part of her job is to make people aware of the changes and improvements in
Sutter Delta. As Antioch has changed, the organization has kept up with those
changes, undergoing transformations of its own. With some 52,000 annual patient
visits, the medical center is no longer that little, crowded facility residents
probably recall from years past.

Many "special people put themselves out emotionally," Vaillancourt went on. She
told me about a 14-year-old Oakley middle-school student who, as part of a
school leadership project, accumulated a collection of videotapes and DVDs to
donate to Sutter Delta's pediatric ward. Green and Vaillancourt believe they are
"conduits" in promoting the volunteer opportunities and in publicizing the
medical center's success in staying current with the times.

They told me more volunteers are always welcome. New residents to Antioch who
volunteered in their former communities are invited to explore the opportunities
Sutter Delta's program has to offer. Sixty percent of the auxiliary members are
active either in the gift shop or in the day-to-day activities of the facility.

Joyce Neely, with whom I had previously spoken, reminded me that the auxiliary
runs many fund-raising activities. In December, the auxiliary completed its
commitment of a $100,000 donation to the new wing, which houses the new
emergency room and women's health center.

Funds are also provided to meet special requests of departments within the
hospital. The Ways and Means Committee is responsible for organizing these
events throughout the year.

Neely went on to say that the gift shop volunteers are to "be commended for
their commitment to achieving lucrative sales that result in remarkable
donations to the auxiliary general fund."

She is in "complete admiration of the amazing dedication of both groups."

Neely continued that she "personally believes our purpose is to establish and
accomplish the goals necessary to provide funds to meet the special needs of the
hospital, and provide exemplary volunteer service resulting in a sense of
satisfaction and well-being to the patients, staff and community of Sutter Delta
Medical Center."

To experience the "positive things that will happen after joining the SDMC
Auxiliary," call the volunteer desk at 925-779-3000, from Monday to Friday, from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. As Neely concluded, "you'll make new friends as you share your
commitment to service. ... The personal rewards are significant."

   The Make-A-Wish Foundation of America's mission is to grant the wishes of
children with life-threatening medical conditions. The charitable organization
grants wishes to ailing kids between the ages of two-and-a-half and 18 from more
than 60 chapters in the US and its territories. Funded through donations,
in-kind contributions, grants, chapter fees, and corporate donations, the
not-for-profit foundation boasts a volunteer network of some 25,000 people and
has granted more than 226,000 wishes to children since its creation in 1980. The

 foundation was originally named the Chris Greicius Make-A-Wish Memorial, after
the first boy to receive his wish: becoming an honorary Arizona state trooper.

   Geographic Reach

   From its headquarters in Phoenix, Make-A-Wish Foundation operates in the US.
The Make-A-Wish International organization boasts affiliates in more than 36
countries across five continents.

   Strategy

   The foundation granted nearly 14,000 wishes in fiscal 2012 alone. Make-A-Wish
Foundation estimates that each wish costs it approximately $7,200. Typically,
children wish to visit a theme park (Disneyland is a popular choice) and travel,
shop for something such as a new computer or electronics, and visit with a pro
athlete or other celebrity. The Walt Disney Company and Macys have been the
largest corporate sponsors of Make-A-Wish Foundation. Through the global
Make-A-Wish foundation, some 30,000 volunteers help the organization grant more
than 225,000 wishes worldwide each year.

   Financial Performance

   Revenue for Make-A-Wish Foundation decreased some 23% in fiscal 2012 as
compared to 2011. Net income also dropped -- by 87% -- during the same reporting
period.

D&T reschedules LI Fast 50 in wake of WTC attack

After canceling its fifth annual Long Island Fast 50 awards ceremony in
September due to the attacks on the World Trade Center, Deloitte & Touche has
rescheduled the event for early next year.

D&T will publish the list in alphabetical order by next week, and announce the
rankings at the awards event in January, according to Jericho office marketing
director Tony Borelli.

"We want to save some suspense," Borelli said.

The ceremony will be held in conjunction with another yet-announced awards
ceremony, and will likely include a special category to recognize companies that
have made the list in each of the past five years.

Debra Wasser, a spokeswoman for Veeco Instruments, which has made the list in
the past, said D&T contacted her to let her know the Sept. 21 event was
postponed in light of the terrorist attacks, but that Veeco made it again this
year. The Fast 50 awards recognize the achievements and contributions of
fast-growing technology companies. Those companies are then considered in D&T's
national competition, which will be held in Florida.

Leaders outline IT challenges

Local hospital leaders outlined the challenges the health care industry faces in
addressing its technology needs at a Oct. 2 meeting hosted by the Long Island
Software and Technology Network at the Long Island Technology Center.

"We need to rescue hospital workers from tangles of regulations and mountains of
paperwork," said J. Ronald Gaudreault, president of Huntington Hospital and
chairman of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council Board. "There is a crying need
for IT issues to be addressed."

Gaudreault said the paperwork overload is, in part, accountable for driving
nurses away from working in hospitals and resulting in the acute nursing
shortage.

Electronic patient records, which failed miserably in the early 1990s, were
cited as a crucial need in abating the paper piles - although access regulations
make its development challenging.

Richard Turan, president and CEO of Nassau University Medical Center, said he is
confident that such technology will make a much anticipated and more competent
comeback. Turan recently announced plans to invest about $15 million over three
years to overhaul the medical center's computer systems.

Donette J. Herring, vice president of information services of Catholic Health
Services of Long Island, explained that financially-strapped hospitals have
deferred major technology investments in favor of revenue-generating ventures
and funding for IT expenses will likely decrease in coming years.

At the same time, when IT efforts have been made, billing regulations and
FDA-required approval for certain products have made the procurement of
technology, as well as the integration of different systems, difficult as well.

AeA partners with LIA

The American Electronics Association and the Long Island Association have formed
a strategic alliance to jointly aid technology and manufacturing firms in the
region.

Richard Lermer, executive director of AeA, said he approached LIA several months
ago to give AeA members better access to high tech companies - both to find out
their needs and potentially establish business relationships.

"The alliance brings together professionals in electronics and other technology
fields to help develop those industries on Long Island," said LIA spokesman Gary
Wojtas.

AeA is hosting a human resources management seminar in November that will
feature speakers both from LIA and the Long Island Forum for Technology. AeA has
had a partnership with LIFT for the past six years and many LIFT companies serve
as suppliers or customers to AeA members.

Although LIFT and LIA are both vying for the designation as the regional
technology development center, Lermer said, "We are in now way involving
ourselves with the NYSTAR grant."

Video conferencing gaining popularity

John Kamen, president of Delta Computer Group, a reseller of video conferencing
and security systems, said travel anxiety and safety concerns have heightened
interest in the company's products.

"A lot of companies are inquiring," Kamen said. "It's getting a lot more serious
a lot faster."

Delta Computer Group and ViewCast most recently sealed a deal with HSBC Bank USA
for the installation of two ViewPoint VBX systems that provide video
distribution for New York and New Jersey locations, and connectivity to systems
in Europe and Hong Kong.

Although HSBC spokeswoman Kathy Young denied the terrorist attacks or fears of
flying have anything to do with the contract - they'd been in negotiations for
months prior - Kamen said he thinks it helped expedite the talks.

Kamen said he's also in negotiations with Verizon for a $1 million contract.

Sisterhood Works For Brighter World Delta Sigma Theta:

BYLINE: Claudia W. Esbenshade

SECTION: B; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 641  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


CESBENSHADE@LNPNEWS.COM

When Dr. Deborah Davis joined Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 1976, she did it to
help others and to help her community.

Now, almost 40 years later, she continues to do just that with the assistance of
her sorority sisters.

"Since I was 17, I knew what I wanted to do," says Davis, of Lancaster,
president of the chapter and authorized spokeswoman. "I always wanted to make a
difference."

The Lancaster Alumnae chapter - 28 members strong and growing - is active in
carrying out the belief system of the sorority, founded by 22 African-American
women at Howard University in 1913.

Since then, more than 200,000 women have joined the organization and worked to
support the ideals of sisterhood, service and scholarship. With 1,000 chapters
on the college and alumnae level, the sorority has both a national and
international presence.

The local women represent a range of generations; they're in their 20s to around
90 years of age. They are teachers, counselors, administrators, nurses, human
resource directors and other professionals. Davis is retired from Hershey
Medical Center, where she was director for diversity, inclusion and employment
equity.

"We have quite the variety of skills that we bring to the table," Davis says.
"We are a group of black, college-educated women who are using their skill sets
to help others."

While the sorority is made up predominately of black women, it is not exclusive
and welcomes those of other races.

Monthly meetings keep the group active, as the members plan everything from
community-based events to educational seminars. They are active in toy drives,
health fairs, fitness runs, educational classes and social events.

The women work year-round to raise funds for chapter scholarships, - ranging
from $500 to $800 - which benefit four local students every year. They are in
touch with high school counselors to identify senior high school students, who
then go through the sorority's interview and application processes.

"We are so proud to make a difference by helping African-American students get
to the college level," Davis says. "We've been through where they're at."

The group works closely with youth through the Delta Gems, an extension of the
sorority that includes 14- to 18-year-old girls in the Oxford area. Sorority
sisters mentor the Gems by hosting field trips, holiday programs, college tours
and a variety of other events.

"It's important that we are role models for promoting higher education and
encourage them to go on to college," Davis says.

While the world is different from when she started out in the sorority, Davis
says a lot of the issues today's young women face are the same.

"We try to stay on top of things and be technologically savvy," Davis says.
"Issues like bullying and financial stability reflect some of the topics we talk
about with youth."

The sorority focuses on economics, education, international awareness, physical
and mental health and political awareness.

The sorority recently held a free financial seminar for the public, focusing on
tax preparation and financial stability.

"In order to help the economic vitality of our community, we have to ask 'Where
do we fit in?' and 'What does that look like?'" Davis says.

Davis is excited for the future of the sorority. The local chapter is growing
and reaching out to the Berks area as well as Oxford.

"I'm proud we are still meeting some of the needs in the community and are still
being of value."

What's In The Cards?

AIRLINES

Passenger growth at Tampa International Airport will rise in 2006 but not as
rapidly as in 2005, when monthly records became commonplace, airport director
Louis Miller said.

"I see growth continuing but slowing," Miller said. "We anticipate passenger
traffic to grow between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2006, compared with 12
percent in 2005."

One reason is that airlines are flying near capacity, he said. Airlines are
rebalancing their systems to find out how they can make the most money.

For example, Delta Air Lines, the airport's second-busiest carrier, intends to
absorb its low-cost spinoff Song into the mainline network but has not revealed
how that will affect 2006 schedules.

Southwest Airlines, Tampa's largest carrier, will add aircraft and service in
2006, and Jet Blue Airways could add flights at Tampa as it expands its fleet.

Spirit Airlines and AirTran Airways are expected to begin Tampa-Cancun service
that was postponed by damage in Mexico from Hurricane Wilma.

However, the future of Independence Air, which flies between Tampa and
Washington, remains uncertain as it tries to find a new owner or investors or is
forced to sell off assets under a bankruptcy protection filing.

St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, which lost its two busiest
carriers to the volatile aviation economy in late 2004 and early 2005, expects
expanded service by USA3000 during the winter visitors season, airport director
Noah Lagos said.

Lagos anticipates new charter flights to the United Kingdom. He said it's too
soon to get a sense of Hooters Air's 2006 plans.

GROWTH COMPANIES

Entrepreneurs in the Tampa Bay area will have a few more sources for money to
fund their business dreams in 2006 as the relatively small pool of local
investors shows signs of growth.

That's because more investors are becoming interested in building "buy-out"
funds that put cash into established companies, with much of the money going to
company founders looking to move on or reap rewards for years of work. Then, the
funds focus on expanding the company for future growth or a sale.

Several such funds started this year in Tampa, including the Barish Fund, which
is partnering with Equitable Capital Management.

Such new capital couldn't come too soon, local deal-makers say, because national
venture capital companies are still focused on well-established companies with
low risk, and too many of the Bay area's wealthy individuals who might put cash
into start-up companies have their cash locked up in real estate.

HEALTH

Two major state-funded pilot projects will change the health care system in
Florida in big ways beginning in 2006.

One, which is controversial, involves shifting Medicaid patients into privately
run health networks, including health maintenance organizations. However, the
only two areas of the state that will be affected in 2006 are northeast and
southeast - centering on Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale.

The less-visible pilot project - to set up a medical Internet for patient
information - is likely to put Tampa Bay in the starring role, beginning in
January.

Early in the month, the state Agency for Health Care Administration is expected
to announce that the Tampa Bay Partnership's regional health information system
will receive a grant to officially launch the first medical Internet system in
the state.

The initial project will link three hospitals - Tampa General, All Children's
and H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center - with physicians at the University of South
Florida and the Medicaid payment system to provide instant health information on
Medicaid patients who have certain diseases. A private Tampa information
technology company, Gold Standard Inc., will coordinate.

ENERGY

Bay area consumers will pay more for energy in 2006, as approved electric rate
increases kick in New Year's Day and gasoline prices rise throughout the year.

Energy experts expect crude oil and natural gas prices to rise through 2006,
continuing to fuel higher prices at the gasoline pump and higher costs for power
companies to produce electricity.

A tight oil supply worldwide and increases in demand from the United States and
China coupled with concerns about disruptions in production or supply will keep
pressure on energy prices.

Tampa Electric Co., Progress Energy Florida Inc. and Florida Power & Light Co.
have told Bay area consumers that electric rates will increase starting in
January. Base rates at the utilities won't go up, but electric customers will
pay for higher fuel costs.

At the pump, gasoline prices are expected to start climbing by the end of
January. Prices will jump about 57 cents by July, said Trilby Lundberg, who
conducts a nationwide survey of 6,000 retail stations.

ECONOMY

The Sunshine State added 255,100 jobs during the past year - more than any other
state - and economists say Florida is on the right track for more jobs in 2006.

In Tampa, job creation seems as much a part of local culture as fried grouper
and Cuban sandwiches.

Brent Short, managing director in Tampa for Spherion Corp., a professional
staffing firm, said there's a simple reason for the job boom in Florida:
Employers want to be here because it's an inexpensive place to do business, and
workers want to be here because the cost of living is comparatively low.

Some businesses said it is becoming more difficult to compete for new workers.
Despite the growing population here, the Tampa Bay metropolitan area's
unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent in November, down from 4.4 percent a year
ago.

In comparison, the national unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in November, down
from 5.2 percent a year ago.

SPORTS

The post-Vince Naimoli era will begin in earnest for the Tampa Devil Rays, who
will ring in 2006 with a new owner in his 40s and two key executives who are
younger than 30.

New owner Stu Sternberg, 46, a retired Wall Street whiz kid from Westchester
County, N.Y., is offering free parking, allowing fans to bring in their own food
and sprucing up Tropicana Field at the cost of $10 million for the 2006 baseball
season.

It's all in the name of mending fences with businesses and attracting more fans
to watch a last-place team that drew the lowest attendance in Major League
Baseball in 2005.

TOURISM

Tourism, Florida's largest industry, is expected to grow at a modest clip in the
coming year. State tourism officials say they expect about 3.2 percent more
visitors in 2006 than this year.

Florida tourism officials said their projections for 2006 would have been more
optimistic, but negative perceptions from hurricanes have altered some visitors'
plans. There also is some worry on a local basis.

Visit Florida, the public-private agency that runs the state's tourism promotion
program, says more than 80 million visitors should come to Florida in 2006, up
from 77.5 million in 2005. The tourism agency's projections are better than the
national tourism outlook.

The Travel Industry Association of America is estimating a 2 percent nationwide
tourism bump in 2006.

Local tourism officials are hoping that hurricane fears and red tide don't have
a long-term effect on keeping away visitors.

INSURANCE

The continuing homeowner insurance crisis shows no signs of abating in 2006.
Citizens Property Insurance Co., the state-supported insurer of last resort, is
slated to raise its rates significantly in 2006. With other insurers fleeing the
market or refusing to write in coastal and sinkhole areas, Citizens keeps on
growing.

The rate increases aren't just affecting Citizens' policyholders. All homeowners
in Florida are getting surcharges on their bills in 2006 to pay for deficits
Citizens ran up covering hurricane claims in 2004 and 2005.

Expect the Legislature to deal with the rising rates in its 2006 session,
including expanding restrictions on the filing of sinkhole claims. However,
experts say rising rates may be a continuing reality.

Auto insurance is another problem legislators are expected to tackle in 2006,
especially the state's no-fault law that ends in 2007. The Senate Committee on
Banking and Insurance has concluded that no-fault should be saved, but it said
reforms are needed to reduce fraudulent medical claims.

RETAIL

Where you get your groceries could be the biggest retail story in Florida in
2006, as two of the state's biggest players, Winn-Dixie Stores and Albertsons,
could sell their stores, close a large number - or turn themselves around.

At the moment, Jacksonville-based Winn-Dixie is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. Just a few years ago, Winn-Dixie operated more than 1,100
supermarkets in the South, but in early December it announced it wants to pare
that to 575 stores in the South and 12 in the Bahamas. Currently, Winn-Dixie has
396 stores in Florida and 14 percent of the state's grocery market, putting it
in third place behind Publix and Wal-Mart.

Meanwhile, Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons is considering a sale of its assets.
The Wall Street Journal reported in mid-December that a group including
Minneapolis-based supermarket chain Supervalu Inc., Cerberus Capital and Kimco
Realty Corp. may purchase Albertsons for $9.6 billion. Albertsons has 116 stores
in Florida and 6 percent of the state's grocery market, according to The Shelby
Report, a supermarket trade journal.

Outside of the grocery industry, commercial real estate brokers say some of the
major players in retail may be eyeing Florida for expansion in 2006. These
include Dick's Sporting Goods, Kohl's, IKEA and Bass Pro Shops. Dick's, a
big-box store in the mold of Sports Authority, has only one store in Florida, in
Jacksonville.

Michael Sasso

REAL ESTATE

The Bay area's white-hot real estate market, like much of the nation, is
expected to cool in the coming year.

Sales prices keep climbing, and the metropolitan area of Tampa, St. Petersburg
and Clearwater saw the median price for an existing home jump to $213,500, up
27.8 percent from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors'
third-quarter report.

Interest rates for home loans are expected to steadily increase in 2006, causing
fewer people to buy homes. Tampa Bay experts, such as the housing research firm
Metrostudy, say the area's good weather and solid job market should keep people
moving to Florida.

The area won't be able to escape the slowdown totally, though, said Tony Polito,
the local director of Metrostudy. Sales may slow, and the price appreciation,
which has remained in the double digits this year, will likely slow to 5 percent
to 10 percent, he said.

Real estate experts predict only the first six of the 12 condominium towers
planned for downtown Tampa will succeed. Rising construction material costs have
slowed progress for some developers, who have raised prices to make up for
increased costs.

El Paso County Family Youth Services Center ready to open doors

BYLINE: Cindy Ramirez, El Paso Times, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 685 words


Nov. 24--After years of changing plans, budget cuts and construction hurdles,
the county's Family Youth Services Center is ready to open its doors to troubled
and emotionally disturbed residents and their families.

The $4.6 million, 21,110-square-foot center on Delta Drive near Ascarate Park
will hold its grand opening Tuesday, and will become the first of its kind in El
Paso County and one of the few statewide, officials said.

"This is a reflection of the community's commitment to provide care to our
families, especially in the mental health field," said Rita Ruelas, director of
the El Paso County Department of Mental Health Support Services.

The agency is one of many that will be housed at the center. Others include the
Juvenile Probation Department, University Medical Center, Emergence Health
Network, and satellite offices of the Domestic Relations Office, the 65th
District Family Drug Court Program and the County Attorney's Office. The
center's assessment hub will house psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists,
licensed social workers and chemical dependency counselors.

The Family Youth Services Center will treat children and adults and provide
prevention services, all aimed at keeping families together without duplication
of work among agencies.

"The concept is that you treat the entire family," Ruelas said. "You may have an
identified client -- maybe a young child having trouble in day care, an
adjudicated youth or a recently incarcerated

parent who is being reintroduced into the community -- but you treat the entire
family and ensure the well-being for everyone involved."

The center will work under a philosophy called "Systems of Care Wrap-Around," a
holistic approach where multiple agencies are housed in one place to better
serve families.

"Everybody is collaborating to provide services under one roof," Ruelas said.
"It's easier to access services, which is more convenient to the family. But
it's also more efficient for those who are providing the services because the
avenues for communication are increased."

The county has long struggled to stabilize its mental health programs,
restructuring and renaming its departments and programs in the past few years.

The Mental Health Support Services Department was formerly the Border Children's
Mental Health Collaborative, which started with a $9 million, seven-year federal
grant in 2002. When the grant ran out, the county stepped in to continue
offering mental health services to the community, but the collaborative soon
found itself embroiled in the public corruption investigation under its previous
leadership.

The department now serves about 1,000 people a year, including children who have
been identified as having behavioral problems, their siblings and parents.

Emergence Health Network was previously known as Mental Health and Mental
Retardation, which was renamed after federal law required that state agencies
replace the term "mental retardation" to "intellectual disability."

The name change also came when the organization was under scrutiny for lavish
travel spending by its former chief operating officer at a time when the agency
was financially strapped.

Emergence Health Network serves two distinct groups of individuals -- those with
a mental health diagnosis and those with intellectual disabilities.

El Paso's Emergence Health Network serves about 8,000 people a year.

The opening of the Family Youth Services Center, Ruelas said, is the next step
in improving mental health care countywide and overcoming the negative stigma
the county's mental health services had lived under.

"It's really exciting to be at this stage, finally," Ruelas said. "We will be
able to make such a difference in the lives of the families we serve."

Money magazine will recognize Bone and Joint Hospital in a special October
edition as one of the most highly acclaimed hospitals for orthopedic care in the
nation.<P>Money magazine used data from HealthGrades, a health research
organization, which ranks hospitals based on the analysis of Medicare data over
a three-year period. Each year, hospitals are ranked for services they provide,
using a five-star rating system. The publication will feature the five top
hospitals from five regions who have received the greatest number of five-star
rankings, the highest achievement possible. The regions include Great Lakes,
Great Plains Northeast, Sun Belt and West Coast.<P>Bone and Joint is being
honored with five separate five-star ratings from HealthGrades for a patient's
first surgery for total knee replacement, a patient's first surgery for total
hip replacement, open reduction internal fixation, partial hip replacement and
back and neck surgeries not requiring a spinal fusion.<P>"This honor reiterates
that Oklahomans can be confident in the caliber of orthopedic care available to
them at Bone and Joint," said Jim Hyde, CEO of Bone and Joint Hospital.<P>OU
Dermatology opens surgery center<P>OU Physicians Dermatology has opened a new
2,825-square-foot Dermatology Surgery Center at 619 NE 13th St. The new facility
adjoins existing physicians' office for the group's dermatologists.<P>According
to Raymond Cornelison, chairman of OU Physicians Dermatology, the facility will
provide patients with a contemporary and comfortable place for routine
appointments as well as specific procedures, including Moh's surgery for
treatment of specific skin cancers, laser therapy and skin peels. <P>"This new
surgery center is equipped with the latest in lasers and other technology used
for today's innovative dermatology procedures," said Cornelison.<P>OU Physicians
dermatologists provide diagnosis and treatment for adults and children with
skin, hair and nail conditions. Microdermabrasion, hair removal, sclerotherapy,
Botox injections and other dermatologic services are provided.<P>OBI prevents
West Nile transmission<P>The Oklahoma Blood Institute prevented the likely
transmission of West Nile virus to at least three patients using a single
testing method that is more sensitive than the more widely used pooled sample
testing method.<P>OBI was the first civilian blood center in the nation to
perform nucleic acid testing for West Nile on a sample from every individual
blood donation. Their data suggested a reduction of sensitivity in using the
standard pooling method, which would not have detected the virus.<P>While West
Nile causes symptoms in only 20 percent of those infected, the virus can be
lethal for a patient with a weakened immune system. <P>"Although the single unit
test for the West Nile virus is more costly, it clearly has the potential to
reduce the transmission of this virus," said Ronald O. Gilcher, MD, CEO and
medical director of the Oklahoma Blood Institute.<P>Since implementing the newly
developed West Nile virus test on July 1, OBI's laboratories have detected the
virus in 14 blood donations. Of those donations, research shows that the pooled
testing would have detected the virus in 11 of the infected donations, but would
have missed the virus in the other three.<P>The single-unit testing procedure,
used by the OBI under a research protocol, increases the sensitivity of the
testing by six to 16 times over the pooled testing method. <P>Delta Dental
donation<P>Delta Dental of Oklahoma has donated $8,500 to the Good Shepherd
Ministries Dental Clinic at 222 NW 12th St.<P>The clinic is a joint venture of
the Good Shepherd Ministries sponsored by the First Baptist Church of Oklahoma
City, the OU College of dentistry and local community volunteers. Started in
1981, Good Shepherd currently operates five dental chairs, with three chairs now
capable of delivering restorative and preventive dentistry as an alternative to
extractions.<P>Good Shepherd is a place where indigent people can come to seek
food, clothing, counseling and basic medical and dental care.<P>"For years, due
to a lack of funding, we were limited in large part to basic emergency care and
simple extractions," said Frank Lipsinic, clinical assistant professor at the
University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry and a volunteer at the clinic. "With
the original gift last year of $14,500 from Delta Dental, we were able to expand
our capabilities with an emphasis on restorative procedures and infection
control processes. This gift not only assures we'll have operating funds for the
next year, it allows us to take a more proactive role with disease prevention
education."<P>OSU medical school receives grant<P>Kenneth E. Miller, associate
professor of anatomy and cell biology at Oklahoma State University College of
Osteopathic Medicine, is the recipient of a five-year, $1.2 million grant from
the National Institute of Health-National Institute of Arthritis and
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to study chronic inflammation and its
treatment. <P>As principal investigator, Miller's research focuses on sensory
nerve changes during inflammation, specifically in nerve fibers in the skin and
joints that produce high levels of glutamate (a neurotransmitter that enables
communication between brain cells) during inflammation, resulting in increased
discomfort. Learning how and why this happens may lead to new ways to inhibit
glutamate production, reducing discomfort from arthritis and other inflammatory
disorders, Miller said.<P>Miller received his doctorate from the University of
Vermont College of Medicine and his post-doctoral training from the University
of Minnesota. He was on faculty at University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center.<P>Kohl's makes gift to Children's Hospital<P>Kohl's Department Stores

Halter, Ross trade jabs over health care

LENGTH: 589  words


Bill Halter on Friday criticized Democratic rival Mike Ross and the Republican
candidates for Arkansas governor for opposing the federal health care law,
saying their stances would have prevented the state from providing insurance to
thousands of low-income residents.


Ross, meanwhile, questioned how Halter planned to fund an expanded college
scholarship program without cutting state services or raising taxes.
The two Democratic candidates for the state's top office traded indirect jabs
during separate appearances before the Delta Grassroots Caucus, focusing more
direct criticism on one another in comments later with reporters.
Halter, a former lieutenant governor, cast himself among the candidates as the
strongest and earliest supporter of a plan to expand health coverage to
thousands of workers in the state under the federal health care law. Gov. Mike
Beebe, a Democrat, last month signed into law a plan to use federal Medicaid
money to purchase private insurance for 250,000 low-income residents. Beebe and
Republican backers of the plan touted the "private option" as an alternative to
expanding Medicaid under the federal health overhaul.
"If they had had their way, we wouldn't have had this option at all," Halter
said.
Halter afterward cited Ross' vote against the federal health care law in
Congress, as well as his vote to repeal the law. Former Congressman Asa
Hutchinson and businessman Curtis Coleman are both seeking the Republican
nomination and have opposed the federal health overhaul.
Hutchinson said Thursday night that he would have signed the private option into
law but would have wanted the issue addressed in a special session, the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette and Talk Business reported. Coleman has opposed the private
option and urged lawmakers to reject it.
Ross defended his vote against the federal health overhaul, noting that Beebe
has said he would have voted against the law if he had been in Congress. Ross
has said he supports the private option plan.
"I've always said there were good parts and bad parts of the health care reform.
I've always said the Medicaid expansion was a good part," Ross told reporters.
During his speech to the group at the Clinton Presidential Library in downtown
Little Rock, Ross said he was skeptical about how Halter planned to pay for a
proposal that would allow high school graduates who maintain a 2.5 GPA to attend
most of the state's colleges and universities tuition-free.
The program would expand the scholarships currently funded by the lottery that
Halter advocated. Halter has said the program would cost the state an additional
$50 million to $75 million a year. Additional money would come from lottery
revenues, federal aid programs such as Pell Grants and private donations, Halter
said.

"We're not like Washington. We can't spend more than we take in ... I have yet
to hear him explain how he's going to pay for that," Ross said.
Halter earlier told the group that he believed the scholarships could be funded
through the state's normal revenue growth. He also told reporters he thought it
was still possible to enact the program despite lawmakers this year approving a
tax cut package that'll eventually cost the state more than $140 million a year.

"It's a $5 billion general revenue budget, it is growing with the economy,"
Halter said. "There are resources there, but ultimately budgets are always about
choices and what I'm saying is the Arkansas Promise is one of the highest return
investments we can make and I'm going to push for it."

Delta Reaches Deal With Pilots, Averting Chapter 11 Filing

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

SECTION: Section C; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1088 words


Delta Air Lines, the nation's third-largest airline, reached a tentative
agreement with its pilots' union last night on long-sought wage and benefit
cuts, averting a threatened bankruptcy filing, at least for now.

Terms of the deal, reached during talks in Herndon, Va., where the pilots' union
is based, were not available.

Agreement came after an intense day of negotiations, during which Delta made its
final offer in its bid for $1 billion in contract concessions, people close to
the company said last night.

If pilots had not agreed to the tentative deal, Delta was prepared to file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection today, these people said.

That move would have put a third major carrier in bankruptcy. United, the
second-largest airline, filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 2002, while
US Airways, the seventh largest, made its second filing for bankruptcy
protection in two years on Sept. 12.

Leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta's 6,900
pilots, must approve the deal before ratification can begin. The union said the
council was reviewing the agreement last night. It did not comment further.

In some ways, the situation was a repeat of what occurred in 2003 at American
Airlines, the industry's biggest carrier, which also threatened to seek
bankruptcy protection if its unions did not grant cuts. Ultimately, American's
unions agreed, as the airline was about to file papers with a bankruptcy court.

But the negotiations between Delta and its pilots, who make up its only
unionized group, lasted far longer. Delta began pushing its pilots for wage and
benefit concessions more than a year ago. In May, Delta issued the first of
numerous warnings that it was likely to seek bankruptcy protection if pilots did
not agree to $1 billion in cuts.

The airline has lost $5.5 billion since 2000, and its available cash has shrunk
from $2.7 billion at the end of 2003 to $1.45 billion at the end of the third
quarter.

The pilots repeatedly balked at the airline's $1 billion request, countering
with proposals containing cuts of up to $705 million.

But as the pressure for a Chapter 11 filing built over recent days, the pilots
moved closer to what the airline was seeking, people with knowledge of the
negotiations said yesterday.

With a pilots' deal in hand, the airline is set to announce a plan today that
would give it more financial breathing room, these people said.

People with knowledge of the financing package said Delta had arranged new terms
with its aircraft lenders that could save it hundreds of millions of dollars
over the next few years.

Along with that, the airline has apparently received a favorable response to the
initial part of an exchange offer made to holders of $20 billion in debt. The
early deadline for that exchange offer occurred Tuesday, while the final
deadline is Nov. 18.

The new financing plan is in addition to a $600 million agreement reached by
Delta earlier this week with American Express Travel Related Services, along
with a separate deal reached with holders of some of its notes.

All those deals hinged on the pilots' approval of the concessions package. And
the deals include lengthy requirements that Delta must meet if it ends up
seeking bankruptcy protection at a later date.

Agreement with the pilots came as Delta's board began a quarterly meeting in
Atlanta last night. The board would have to approve a Chapter 11 filing by the
airline. Last week, company officials said that the only things that could avert
a bankruptcy filing would be a deal with the pilots as well as steps to improve
its financial outlook.

Delta's chief executive, Gerald A. Grinstein, kept close tabs on the
negotiations from his Atlanta office, company officials said.

Mr. Grinstein, a veteran Delta board member, became chief executive in January,
after his predecessor, Leo F. Mullin, failed in his own efforts to persuade
pilots to grant cuts.

Since taking charge, Mr. Grinstein has outlined a transformation plan for Delta,
founded in 1924 as a crop-dusting company.

As recently as four years ago, Delta was considered one of the airline's
best-managed and efficient airlines, with extensive East Coast and international
routes, along with its shuttle linking New York, Boston and Washington.

But in 2000, the airline signed a contract with its pilots that made them the
highest-paid in the industry. Meanwhile, low-fare airlines like JetBlue and
AirTran invaded Delta's turf, with ticket prices hundreds of dollars lower than
fares Delta charged on the same routes.

The high labor costs and low-fare competition combined in the last year with
skyrocketing prices for jet fuel, heightening the airline's financial crisis.

In September, Mr. Grinstein outlined plans to cut up to 7,000 jobs through 2006,
and to close Delta's hub in Dallas. Delta also said its salaried employees would
take 10 percent pay cuts and reductions in sick and vacation time, and lose
their post-retirement health care. Mr. Grinstein gave up his salary in the final
quarter of the year.

At the same time, Delta said it would concentrate on flights from its hubs in
Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. This winter, it is set to undertake an
extensive overhaul of its flights, spacing them out so that its hubs are not
crowded one hour and empty the next.

Even so, some analysts have said the airline moved far too slowly to attack its
financial problems.

''Delta has had a lot of time to learn from those who have preceded it'' into
fiscal crisis, namely United, American and US Airways, said Michael Allen, chief
operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting and
analysis firm.

Despite its transformation plan, Delta remains a sprawling company at a time
when leaner, more financially able airlines are leading the industry.

This summer, Southwest passed Delta to become the nation's biggest carrier of
domestic passengers, even though Delta started its own low-fare carrier, Song,
to woo back customers it had lost.

Jagdish N. Sheth, a professor of marketing and corporate strategy at Emory
University in Atlanta, said Delta might be better off focusing on its profitable
international routes.

''They want to be everywhere, but they don't have enough traffic to be
everywhere,'' Professor Sheth said of Delta, which flies to 496 destinations in
96 countries and carried 104 million passengers last year.

That shift could result in an airline far smaller than Delta today. But, he
said: ''It's good for them. Who says that bigger is better?''

semi-private rooms for veterans staying overnight. The facility, at the VA's
University Drive location, includes a laundry, lounge/dining area, vending
machines and a large-screen television.

The VA has opened similar facilities at several of its hospitals.

Top officers of Comair will take pay cuts

As part of cost-control measures needed to restore Comair Inc.'s
competitiveness, the regional airline's new president says he and other top
officers will take a 10 percent pay cut beginning March 1.

Comair President Fred Buttrell took over the company Jan. 17. He replaced Randy
Rademacher, who resigned after Comair canceled its approximately 1,100 Christmas
flights when a computer system used for scheduling flight crews failed. The
shutdown and related expenses cost Comair and its owner, Delta Air Lines, $20
million, Delta has said.

In December, Comair, based at the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International
Airport, announced that managers and nonunion workers would not receive pay
raises this year.

Three sections of code suspended by high court

The state Supreme Court has suspended three sections of its judicial code
because of an appeals court judge's campaign to become a justice.

William O'Neill, an 11th Ohio District Court of Appeals judge, was defeated by
Justice Terrence O'Donnell in the November election.

The three parts of the Code of Judicial Conduct have been suspended
indefinitely, Supreme Court spokesman Chris Davey said.

State Rep. James Trakas, the Cuyahoga County GOP chairman, filed a complaint
against O'Neill in July with the Supreme Court disciplinary counsel's office,
Ohio State Bar Association and Ohio Elections Commission.

Cuyahoga River deemed safe to fish again

The Cuyahoga River, known for catching fire when an oil slick burned in 1969,
now is clean enough for catching steelhead trout.

Don Killinger, research supervisor for the Cuyahoga County Health Board, said,
"There has never been any recommendation by any agency to fish on the Cuyahoga
River, especially in the Cuyahoga County area, because of the conditions of the
river in the past and all the pollution."

The state Route 82 dam in Brecksville and the Gorge Park dam in Cuyahoga Falls
once were among the most-polluted areas on the river. Their newfound fishing

decades earlier.

Gun Bash planned to aid the WVU rifle team

Plans are under way for the second Gun Bash to benefit the West Virginia
University rifle team, which has won 13 national championships but no longer
receives funding from the university.

The event will be July 29-31 at Mylan Park in Morgantown in conjunction with the
Mountain State bike rally, said Mark Sellaro, a member of the team from 1971 to
1974 who now is part of the WVU Rifle Endowment team.

The university cut off funding for the rifle team in the spring of 2003.

The first Gun Bash last year raised more than $100,000, less than the expected
$200,000 because heavy rain hurt attendance. It takes about $163,000 a year to
fund the team.

Vigil held after police blamed in wreck death

Relatives and friends of an accident victim whose body lay undiscovered in a
wrecked cargo van for about 15 hours after the crash kept a 15-hour vigil in
front of a state police detachment because they say troopers botched the
investigation and maybe a chance to save his life.

An autopsy indicated that Dwight Ernest Ferguson, 21, of Wayne, likely died
within minutes of the crash. A tow truck operator found his body inside the van
after it was taken to a tow company's salvage yard.

The Jan. 18 crash along Route 152 in Lavalette also killed Ferguson's friend,
Darrell Maynard, 21, of Wayne, who was ejected from the vehicle and later died
at a Huntington hospital.

The vigil lasted from late Friday night through early Saturday afternoon at the
Wayne detachment. About 50 people participated for at least part of the vigil,
one attendee said.

City councilman pleads guilty to drug charge

A Martinsburg city councilman has agreed to plead guilty to one count of
delivery of a controlled substance and to resign from office in exchange for a
reduced sentence and bail.

As part of Friday's plea bargain, Frank Idoni also agreed to plead no contest to
a misdemeanor count of battery and to turn over any guns in his house to the
Martinsburg Police Department. A second count of delivery of a controlled
substance will be dismissed.

The plea bargain must be approved by a circuit judge.

Under the agreement, Idoni would be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison for
the drug charge and one year for the battery charge. Both sentences would be
suspended in favor of five years' probation, said Berkeley County Assistant
Prosecutor Joshua Henline. Idoni posted bond Friday and was released.

Man was cooking meth before blast, police say

A man who was killed in an explosion apparently was in the process of cooking
methamphetamine, state police said.

The body of Alva G. Brady, 39, of Frametown, was discovered after the Saturday
morning fire in an outbuilding was extinguished.

Mississippi: State approves rate jump for 1 of 2 health exchange insurers

LENGTH: 626  words

DATELINE: New York



 Jackson: Mississippi State University Extension has issued the following news
release:



 Mississippi's insurance commissioner has approved a rate increase of 43
percent, on average, for one of two health insurers selling policies on the
health exchange created under the federal health care overhaul.





 Commissioner Mike Chaney said Thursday he approved the increase, beginning Jan.
1, for Kentucky-based Humana because actuaries project a sharp increase in costs
and he feared Humana would leave Mississippi.



 "I've approved this because it's justified and if I didn't approve it, they
might have pulled out of the whole state," Chaney said in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press.



 Humana intends to serve 28 of Mississippi's 82 counties in 2017, leaving 18
counties. It's the only provider currently planning to offer policies on the
federally subsidized exchange in 16 counties, mostly in the Mississippi Delta
and southwest Mississippi.



 The Republican Chaney said Humana, which has about 13,000 policyholders on the
federal exchange, initially sought a nearly 50 percent increase.



 Chaney said he also approved a rate increase of roughly 7 percent on average
for Magnolia Health, a unit of St. Louis-based Centene Corp. The commissioner
said Magnolia has about 40,000 customers on the exchange. It also runs one of
Mississippi's two managed care networks for the state-federal Medicaid program.



 Neither Humana nor Magnolia immediately responded to requests for comment late
Thursday.



 The average premium for the benchmark silver plan, where policyholders pay
about 30 percent of costs, fell 8 percent from 2015 to 2016 in Mississippi.
Premiums fell 19 percent the year earlier, according to the Commonwealth Fund.



 Of Mississippians, 95 percent get subsidies cutting their costs, dropping the
average premium to $91 a month, federal figures show.



 UnitedHealth Group, which had been offering policies in all 82 counties and has
18,000 policyholders, has announced it is leaving the state after 2016. That
will leave only 12 counties, mostly in a south Mississippi belt along U.S. 84,
with more than one company offering coverage. Magnolia will be the only company
selling policies in the state's nine most populous counties, which contain 40
percent of the state's residents. Chaney said an unnamed company has been
awaiting federal approval for months to offer policies in all 82 counties.



 Chaney said all three companies currently selling policies are making profits
from the Mississippi exchange market. He said Humana is projecting large
increases in costs for medical care and drugs. Magnolia, which has been charging
higher premiums, is projecting lower cost increases.



 Premium increases could also affect thousands of people who buy unsubsidized
individual policies that are linked to the subsidized policies offered under the
Affordable Care Act.



 Going into their fourth year, the health law's markets are still searching for
stability. That's in contrast to more-established government programs like
Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers profitably cover tens
of millions of people.



 The health law's nagging problems center on lower-than-hoped-for enrollment,
sicker-than-expected customers and a balky internal stabilization system that
didn't deliver as advertised and was already scheduled to be pared back next
year.



 Insurers have sought large increases in a number of states, although it remains
unclear what the nationwide change will be. From 2015 to 2016, premiums for a
benchmark silver plan rose by a little more than 7 percent on average, according
to administration figures

Nigeria: Community-Based Support for OVC (CUBS) Project

LENGTH: 235  words


PROJECT DATE: 2009-2014
The Community-Based Support for OVC (CUBS) Project is improving the well-being
of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Nigeria by integrating a currently
fragmented OVC service delivery system, mobilizing community support, and
raising awareness of the issues and needs of OVCs. Over five years, the project
will provide 50,000 OVC with comprehensive OVC services and train 12,500
providers/caregivers in service delivery in 11 focal states (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa,
Delta, Rivers, Gombe, Taraba, Kebbi, Sokoto, Ekiti, Enugu, and Imo). The CUBS
project will scale up OVC service delivery, while offering new approaches for
enhancing service outreach to OVCs, building community ownership, and addressing
gender discrimination. Services to be delivered to OVC include food and
nutritional support, shelter and care, protection, health care, psychosocial
support, education and vocational training, and increased economic
opportunities. The project will build the capacity of government agencies and
service providers, strengthen systems, and award small grants to civil-society
organizations and faith-based organizations to deliver OVC services. The CUBS
project was awarded to MSH in partnership with Africare under the AIDSTAR I IQC
contract, funded by the President%s Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief through the
United States Agency for International Development.

Roundup: Commerce to probe pipe dumping complaints; Delta adds international
flights; more

Commerce to investigatepipe dumping complaints against 11 nations

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday it will investigate complaints that
India, Korea, the Philippines and eight other nations are dumping oil and
natural gas tubing products in the United States at below cost. Nine steel
producers including U.S. Steel Corp. filed the trade case with government
regulators on July 2. The case will be the largest and most important in steel
industry history, analysts said. The steel industry said imports have surged 111
percent in recent years from those countries, causing "material injury" to
domestic producers of so-called oil country tubular goods. The International
Trade Commission is scheduled to make its preliminary injury determinations by
Aug. 16. If the ITC determines there is a reasonable indication that imports
hurt the domestic industry, the investigations will continue.

Delta adds international flights from Pittsburgh

Delta Air Lines plans to add weekly flights from Pittsburgh International
Airport to the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas in December, Allegheny County
Executive Rich Fitzgerald said on Tuesday. Starting Dec. 21, Delta will make
Saturday round-trips to Nassau in the Bahamas and Punta Cana in the Dominican
Republic. Fitzgerald said Delta is looking to add a third flight south of the
border. Delta and Aeromexico applied with the U.S. and Mexican governments to
jointly offer a flight between Pittsburgh and Cancun, Fitzgerald said. Delta
offers 33 daily flights to seven U.S. destinations from Pittsburgh, as well as
flights to Paris, Pittsburgh's only nonstop trans-Atlantic service.

Earnings flat at FNB Corp.

FNB Corp., based in Hermitage, Mercer County, reported relatively flat quarterly
net income of $29.2 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $29.1 million,
or 21 cents a share, the year earlier. Higher net interest income and
noninterest income offset a higher provision for possible loan losses and $2.9
million in merger-related costs. Last October, FNB agreed to acquire Annapolis
Bancorp Inc. and its eight branches in Maryland. The $51 million deal, which
closed in April, marked FNB's entree to the Maryland market. It buttressed that
move last month by agreeing to acquire BCSB Bancorp Inc., including 16 branches
in Maryland, for $79 million. First National Bank, Western Pennsylvania's
third-largest bank, operates about 95 branches in this market, out of more than
250 elsewhere in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Maryland.

Window maker Veka to add 38 jobs in Beaver County

Veka Inc., a manufacturer of vinyl windows and doors, will expand operations and
invest more than $6 million to add 38 jobs in Beaver County. Veka will expand
its plant in Fombell so it can install equipment for a new customer. The money
will be used for infrastructure, equipment and training costs. The company has
364 workers at the plant. The state Department of Community and Economic
Development offered the company a $190,000 grant, $114,000 in tax credits and a
$17,100 training grant for the project. James Druschel, Veka's chief financial
officer, said Veka has three plants in the United States and decided to expand
in Pennsylvania. Dewitt Peart, president of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance,
said there was competition from another state for the project.

Court reverses decision in Mylan-GlaxoSmithKline case

Mylan Inc. said a federal appeals court has reversed a lower court decision that
dismissed a claim for breach of contract the Cecil-based generic drugmaker
brought against GlaxoSmithKline. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ordered U.S.
District Court for New Jersey to allow Mylan's lawsuit to proceed to trial.
Mylan said it filed the lawsuit after Glaxo agreed to supply the generic form of
antidepression drug Paxil to a Mylan competitor after Mylan and Glaxo had
reached a licensing agreement. Mylan said it is seeking monetary damages and an
injunction preventing Glaxo from supplying other drugmakers with Paxil.

AK Steel 2Q loss narrows, beats predictions

AK Steel Holding Corp. said on Tuesday that its second-quarter loss narrowed
considerably, helped by easy comparisons to a prior-year period weighed down by
hefty income-tax expenses. The West Chester, Ohio, company posted a loss of
$40.4 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with a loss of $724.2 million, or
$6.55 per share, in the same quarter of 2012. The year-ago period included
tax-related charges of $735.6 million, or $6.65 per share. Revenue fell 9
percent to $1.4 billion from $1.54 billion.

Wendy's tops expectations, plans to sell restaurants

Wendy's reported a quarterly profit above Wall Street expectations and said it's
selling 425 of its restaurants to franchisees, a move that's expected to help
boost its profit margins. The move isn't unusual; fast-food companies often own
only a small percentage of their restaurants. This helps keep their operating
costs in check and gives them a more stable stream of income that's tilted
toward royalty fees and rent, rather than sales at restaurants. Wendy's, based
in Dublin, Ohio, raised its dividend by 25 percent to 5 cents per share.

Other business news

The U.S. Department of Labor awarded Pennsylvania a $3.6 million grant to
provide training to dislocated workers, particularly in the
advanced-manufacturing, energy and health care sectors. The state Department of
Labor and Industry, which will administer the grant, said it will give priority
to training the long-term unemployed, those likely to exhaust unemployment
compensation benefits before finding work, and veterans and their eligible
spouses.

S&T Bancorp Inc. of Indiana, Pa., reported quarterly net income jumped 64
percent to $14.1 million, or 47 cents a share, from $8.6 million, or 30 cents a
share, the year earlier. Results mainly stemmed from a lower, $1 million
provision for possible loan losses, compared with $7 million the year earlier.
S&T Bank operates 26 branches in the Pittsburgh region.

HealthNet to open new monthly off-site clinic in Beloit

BYLINE: Shelly Birkelo, The Janesville Gazette, Wis.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 622 words


Dec. 02--JANESVILLE -- HealthNet of Rock County is responding to a loss of
patients caused by changes in health care laws by loosening its eligibility
guidelines and hosting a monthly clinic in Beloit.

The 20-year-old, Janesville-based, free clinic lost 29 patients and 1,194
patient visits between fiscal year 2012-13 and 2013-14 because of the Affordable
Health Care Act and changes in BadgerCare, said Jean Randles, executive
director.

"Every patient that comes to us must enroll in BadgerCare or the Affordable Care
Act if they qualify and can afford Affordable Health Care Act premiums," she
said.

HealthNet helped many people transition into the programs, Randles said.

HealthNet's board and staff began brainstorming in October about how it could
better serve the community while making best use of staff and volunteers, she
said.

HealthNet will:

-- Host a monthly off-site clinic at Beloit Memorial Hospital starting in
January.

Volunteer doctors, HealthNet nurses and administrative employees will staff the
clinic in Beloit when doors open Jan. 8.

Five Beloit Health System doctors--practicing and retired physicians who work in
a variety of medical fields--have volunteered for the first five scheduled
clinics.

Dr. Leland From, a member of HealthNet's board of directors, is recruiting the
volunteer doctors. From retired last summer after practicing internal medicine
and serving as vice president of medical affairs at Beloit.

Clinic dates will be flexible and determined by volunteer doctor schedules, he
said.

-- Lower its eligibility guidelines, meaning more people will qualify for its
services.

Randles said HealthNet would now see people at or below 200 percent of the
federal poverty level. Before, it saw only patients at or below 185 percent of
the federal poverty level.

An individual earning up to $23,340 annually or a family of four with annual
income up to $47,700 can be served by HealthNet under the new guidelines, she
said.

-- Serve patients with some insurance.

"That means a person may have health insurance but no dental insurance so would
be eligible for dental through HealthNet," Randles said.

If the clinic in Beloit is successful, HealthNet wants to partner with
additional clinics and hospitals to provide monthly clinics in other Rock County
communities, she said.

HealthNet is not competing with Community Health Systems, Beloit's low-cost
clinic formerly known as Beloit Area Community Health Center. Each organization
is funded differently and serves different clients, she said.

Community Health Systems is federally funded, while HealthNet receives dollars
from the state, Rock County Human Services, city of Janesville Community
Development Block Grant, United Way Blackhawk Region, Delta Dental and the
Janesville Foundation in addition to other donations, Randles said.

Community Health Systems is a federal-qualified health care center that is
required to charge fees. Even though it charges on a sliding fee scale, those
costs are more than what HealthNet patients can afford based on their income,
she said.

Community Health Systems also is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings and has lost
most of its providers, From said.

Even with the addition of HealthNet's new monthly clinic, "it isn't going to be
enough to serve the need that is here. But it is a start," he said.

Randles agreed: "HealthNet is about responding to community needs and we're
hearing that the Beloit community is not receiving services to the level the
residents need right now. But with this partnership with Beloit Health Systems,
we'll be able to provide services."

Mississippi: State approves rate jump for 1 of 2 health exchange insurers

LENGTH: 627  words

DATELINE: New York



 Jackson: Mississippi Business Journal has issued the following news release:



  Mississippi's insurance commissioner has approved a rate increase of 43
percent, on average, for one of two health insurers selling policies on the
health exchange created under the federal health care overhaul.



  Commissioner Mike Chaney said Thursday he approved the increase, beginning
Jan. 1, for Kentucky-based Humana because actuaries project a sharp increase in
costs and he feared Humana would leave Mississippi.

  "I've approved this because it's justified and if I didn't approve it, they
might have pulled out of the whole state," Chaney said in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press.

  Humana intends to serve 28 of Mississippi's 82 counties in 2017, leaving 18
counties. It's the only provider currently planning to offer policies on the
federally subsidized exchange in 16 counties, mostly in the Mississippi Delta
and southwest Mississippi.

  The Republican Chaney said Humana, which has about 13,000 policyholders on the
federal exchange, initially sought a nearly 50 percent increase.

  Chaney said he also approved a rate increase of roughly 7 percent on average
for Magnolia Health, a unit of St. Louis-based Centene Corp. The commissioner
said Magnolia has about 40,000 customers on the exchange. It also runs one of
Mississippi's two managed care networks for the state-federal Medicaid program.

  Neither Humana nor Magnolia immediately responded to requests for comment late
Thursday.

  The average premium for the benchmark silver plan, where policyholders pay
about 30 percent of costs, fell 8 percent from 2015 to 2016 in Mississippi.
Premiums fell 19 percent the year earlier, according to the Commonwealth Fund.

  Of Mississippians, 95 percent get subsidies cutting their costs, dropping the
average premium to $91 a month, federal figures show.

  UnitedHealth Group, which had been offering policies in all 82 counties and
has 18,000 policyholders, has announced it is leaving the state after 2016. That
will leave only 12 counties, mostly in a south Mississippi belt along U.S. 84,
with more than one company offering coverage. Magnolia will be the only company
selling policies in the state's nine most populous counties, which contain 40
percent of the state's residents. Chaney said an unnamed company has been
awaiting federal approval for months to offer policies in all 82 counties.

  Chaney said all three companies currently selling policies are making profits
from the Mississippi exchange market. He said Humana is projecting large
increases in costs for medical care and drugs. Magnolia, which has been charging
higher premiums, is projecting lower cost increases.

  Premium increases could also affect thousands of people who buy unsubsidized
individual policies that are linked to the subsidized policies offered under the
Affordable Care Act.

  Going into their fourth year, the health law's markets are still searching for
stability. That's in contrast to more-established government programs like
Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers profitably cover tens
of millions of people.

  The health law's nagging problems center on lower-than-hoped-for enrollment,
sicker-than-expected customers and a balky internal stabilization system that
didn't deliver as advertised and was already scheduled to be pared back next
year.

  Insurers have sought large increases in a number of states, although it
remains unclear what the nationwide change will be. From 2015 to 2016, premiums
for a benchmark silver plan rose by a little more than 7 percent on average,
according to administration figures

Competition Not an Issue

                             June 14, 2004, Monday

By LAURA K. THOMPSON



Western Mississippi is not exactly on banks' radar screens as a market for
expansion.

An 11-county region in the heart of the Mississippi Delta is statistically the
poorest in the United States -- dead last among 171 "economic areas" defined by
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, with an average per capita income of $18,618 in
2002. It is not surprising, then, that from 1997 to 2002 its population dropped
4.7%, the third-largest decline in the nation in that period.

Yet Southern Development Bancorp, a $404 million-asset bank holding company in
Arkadelphia, Ark., announced in April that it is acquiring four branches in this
region from State Capital Corp.

Why? Phillip N. Baldwin, Southern's president and chief executive officer, said
State Capital, of Greenwood, Miss., likely would have closed the branches
otherwise, and residents and business owners would have had to drive 60 miles
just to find an automated teller machine.

"If we're not there, then they don't have access to anything else, and banks are
really part of the fabric and culture of little towns," Mr. Baldwin said. "They
are also a great springboard for development."

Southern says it is less interested in the branches' deposits than it is in
making a difference. While other banks, such as the $637 million-asset State
Capital, seek to build and acquire in high-growth areas near large cities,
Southern's strategy is to move into towns that others are abandoning, such as
Webb, Shelby, Greenville, and Clarksdale. Its larger mission is nothing less
than rebuilding the impoverished Delta region of Mississippi and Arkansas.

Garland W. Binns Jr., a financial services attorney with Dover Dixon Horne PLLC
in Little Rock, said, "Most banks are trying now to go to economically viable
areas where there is a high growth rate," because of shareholder pressure for
returns, but Southern is "going to areas that need economic development and
improvement."

That's not to say it is sacrificing profits for the sake of doing good. Last
year it earned $4.4 million and generated a respectable return on equity of
10.93%.

But making money is not what gets Mr. Baldwin out of bed in the morning. He said
he is more motivated by the appreciation of Delta residents, whose towns have
slowly started to improve since Southern started buying banks and branches there
six years ago.

Since 1998 Southern has acquired three institutions and seven branches in the
region, which it used to create two banks: Delta Southern Bank in Ruleville,
Miss., with six branches and $52 million of assets, and First National Bank of
Phillips County in West Helena, Ark., with seven branches and $190 million of
assets.

The company also operates the $161 million-asset Elk Horn Bank and Trust Co. in
Arkadelphia, which is outside the Delta region.

Most of Southern's branches in the Delta also house offices of its three
nonprofits, all of which aim to improve economic opportunities for area
residents by building affordable housing, funding downtown beautification
projects, and helping the local governments put together budgets and install
computer systems.

One of the banks it has acquired is Bank of Ruleville. George Purcell, the
former president at Bank of Ruleville and now the president of Delta Southern,
said that since the 2002 acquisition, his bank has become a bustling center of
activity in Ruleville; it doubles as a job-training area for residents and a
technical assistance center for local businesses and governments.

His job description has also changed. "Before, I just had one hat and did just
what a banker does, but now I've got to wear the banker hat sometimes and also
put on the do-gooder hat sometimes," Mr. Purcell said.

Through Southern's nonprofit Good Faith Fund, Delta Southern has given $200,000
of grants to local nonprofits to support improvements, such as streetlights for
downtown Ruleville and the construction of a farmers' market outside of Drew.

Through a partnership between the banks and the Good Faith Fund, Southern also
provides individual development accounts to new businesses. By the end of the
summer it hopes to offer these businesses microloans ranging from $500 to $5,000
to help them buy equipment or renovate their offices.

Southern is also looking into providing microloans -- essentially the size and
length of traditional payday loans -- to individuals. Angela Duran, Good Faith's
director, said these products are being developed to help the Delta residents
become familiar with financial services.

"There are a lot of unbanked people whose needs may not be met by traditional
banking products," and the microloans would give them "an entry step on the
banking path," Ms. Duran said.

Southern's other services include a nursing assistant training program that has
graduated more than 500 students in the last five years; a women's business
center that trains and counsels female entrepreneurs; and a real estate
developer that funds the construction of affordable housing.

These services can be provided with little strain on Southern's bottom line
because of a special arrangement with its investors, which are primarily
corporate foundations. These 30 foundations, including the Walton Family
Foundation and the Ford Foundation, decline dividends, so the money can be used
instead to support the nonprofits.

Because Southern and all of its subsidiaries are Treasury Department-designated
community development financial institutions, Southern also gets about 15% of
its funding from the federal government. It is one of about 23 bank holding
companies with the CDFI designation.

The largest CDFI, the $1.4 billion-asset ShoreBank Corp. of Chicago, and the
Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation of Little Rock established Southern in 1986 with
support from then-Gov. Bill Clinton. It started operations in 1988, when it
acquired Elk Horn Bank, and got its first branches in the Delta region when it
bought First Delta Corp. in West Helena in 1998.

Mr. Baldwin joined Southern in 2000 and became the CEO in January 2002. Since
then he has made a concerted effort to improve its banks' lending policies and
clean up their portfolios, which he said used to contain risky loans that are
now being made by the nonprofits.

In 2001 its three banks' net chargeoffs were 1.46% of total loans, and the
percentage of nonperforming loans was 2.57%. Last year the chargeoff rate was
0.46%, and the nonperforming loan rate was 1.49%.

"You have to manage a good business first, and then you can go out and do other
things," he said.

With its loan portfolio in order, Mr. Baldwin said, Southern can now focus on
its largest project to date: completely redeveloping Helena and West Helena, two
Arkansas towns near the Mississippi border.

Helena and West Helena were once hotbeds of commerce along the Mississippi, but
a flood in 1927 devastated the towns, and the area has never really recovered.

Supported by a large grant from the Walton Family Foundation, Southern aims to
reform the cities' schools, improve access to health care, establish a central
business district, and build affordable housing.

"Our plan is to take this money and fix one city, and the impact will be felt in
a 75-mile radius," Mr. Baldwin said. "Then we will go 150 miles away and make a
difference," in another place, "changing the region one city at a time."

Helena and West Helena are just starting to feel the effects. One of the major
projects Southern is assisting is the destruction of 100 rundown homes, which
will be replaced by homes built through Habitat for Humanity. Also, a $1.6
million loan made through First National Bank and Good Faith funded the
construction of a building, which will open in the fall, to house the area's
only charter school.

Southern did not go into large-scale development without doing its research.
With the help of two universities, it spent 8,000 hours studying why no previous
efforts to develop the Delta region had worked. The main problem, according to
Mr. Baldwin, was that outsiders created their plans with little input from the
community.

To find out what the residents wanted from their community, Southern formed
about 20 focus groups involving several different mixes of races, ages, and
income levels. And though race relations are still very tense in the area, Mr.
Baldwin said that the groups' results were indistinguishable from each other.

"Everyone wants the same things: A good education for their children, new jobs
so that their children will stay in the area, and a safe and pretty city," he
said.

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office of the Senator Rob Portman has issued the following news
release:



 U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations, praised federal law enforcement authorities for securing
convictions of the leaders of a human trafficking ring in Marion, Ohio, that
enslaved a number of migrant children in onerous conditions.  Portman led a
Senate investigation of the case and of the Obama's administration's role in
delivering the victims into the hands of their abusers.  The investigation
concluded that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded custody
of children to the Marion trafficking ring without taking basic precautions to
ensure their safety.  In response to the investigation, HHS has taken steps to
strengthen background checks, but continues to deny its full responsibility for
the custody and care of children it places with caregivers.  Portman issued the
following statement:





 "I'm pleased that the victims in this case have received justice, but it is
shocking that human trafficking -- really modern-day slavery -- continues to
exist today, even in Ohio.  What makes this case even more alarming is that the
federal government was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the
hands of their abusers.  While the Obama administration claims they have made
strides in stopping these horrific practices, the fact is that it truly doesn't
know how many other cases there are like the Marion trafficking case.  We will
continue to hold the administration accountable for these abuses and to ensure
that this never happens again."



 NOTE:  Portman's six-month PSI investigation produced shocking revelations that
the Obama administration - through the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a
division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) - placed
migrant children with a human trafficking ring in Ohio.  At a hearing on this
issue on January 28, administration officials continued to evade responsibility
for these troubling practices and confirmed that despite placing migrant
children with thousands of sponsors, it had never fired a sponsor for failing to
care for a child. Portman's report can be viewed here.  The video, opening
statements, and witness testimony from the hearing is available here.



 Portman-Authored Law Leads to Two Wins for Ohio Steelworkers



 Because of Senator Portman's Leveling the Playing Field Act, which was signed
into law last year, the International Trade Commission (ITC) and Commerce
Department are now beginning to use the new tools they were given to ensure that
Ohio workers can get relief more quickly if foreign competitors like China
continue to cheat.  In other words, they can get relief now, and don't have to
wait until plants are shuttered and workers lose their jobs.



 Twice in the last week, the ITC has ruled in favor of Ohio steelworkers.
First, on June 22, it voted unanimously to find that the American steel industry
has been materially injured by imports of cold-rolled steel from China and
Japan.  And then on June 24, the ITC unanimously determined that imports of
corrosion-resistant steel from China, India, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan are
causing injury to U.S. steel producers.  As a result, in both cases the Commerce
Department will issue antidumping and countervailing duty orders as high as 265
percent on steel coming from these foreign competitors.



 Last month, Portman urged the ITC to fully use the tools given to them in the
Leveling the Playing Field Act when determining whether the dumping and
subsidies were causing material injury.  Portman discussed both steel cases in
his testimony before the commission:



 "The major reason layoffs are happening is because the U.S. market is being
flooded with unfair imports. Take, for example, just the steel at issue in these
three cases: from 2013 to 2015, U.S. imports of cold rolled steel increased by
more than 110 percent, imports of hot-rolled steel doubled, and imports of
corrosion-resistant steel increased by 75 percent. That was just in two years.
And these increases continue. &hellip;



 "I am confident that when you review the record in each of these cases, you
will find that domestic producers have suffered material injury by reason of
unfair trade.  Unfairly-traded imports not only prevented domestic producers
from taking full advantage of stronger demand conditions in 2014, but
contributed to a dramatic decline in prices in 2015.  The results have been
disastrous.  Last year, for example, U.S. producers of cold-rolled steel
suffered a net loss of $162.4 million.  U.S. producers of corrosion-resistant
steel suffered a net loss of $77.6 million. &hellip;



 "I know this Commission to be a diligent and thoughtful body that has been
given a great responsibility by Congress: the responsibility to enforce our AD
and CVD laws in a manner that will lead to better and fairer market competition.
In fulfilling that responsibility, I urge you to pay close attention to our
recent clarification of the injury standard, and to ensure that our laws are
strictly enforced. Otherwise, we risk encouraging further market-distorting
practices by foreign competitors."



 Ohio steelworkers produce the highest quality steel in the world, and yet they
are facing a crisis.  Nearly 1,500 Ohio steelworkers were laid off last year
through no fault of their own, but now the ITC is beginning to recognize exactly
what Senator Portman has told them: that unfair, dishonest practices from
competitors in China and Japan are hurting our communities. These rulings are
the next step in leveling the playing field, and Senator Portman, who has been
awarded the "Congressional Steel Champion Award," will continue his work to
protect the steel industry and Ohio steelworkers.

 Congratulating Dayton on Receiving the HUD Choice Neighborhood Grant



 Portman issued the following statement after the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) formally announced that Dayton had won the HUD Choice
Neighborhood grant and would receive $1.5 million in grant funding from the
federal government to further develop and transform the Desoto Bass
neighborhood:



 "This is a big win for Dayton because this grant will help revitalize the
Desoto Bass area by reinvesting in this distressed neighborhood," Portman said.
"In fact, this grant has already invigorated the Dayton area by bringing the
community together to plan for the redevelopment of the neighborhood so that
residents can have safe, affordable housing. I look forward to continuing to
work with the Greater Dayton Premier Management and the City of Dayton to ensure
a successful transformation of the Desoto Bass area."



 BACKGROUND: Senator Portman has worked with federal, state, and local leaders
throughout the process in the effort to help Greater Dayton Premier Management
and the city land the grant, including writing a letter of support to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development for the city of Dayton's grant
application in April.



 Honoring John Glenn



 Portman issued the following statement on Tuesday's renaming of Port Columbus
Airport after former Senator John Glenn:



 "John Glenn is an American hero who spent more than half a century serving his
country," Portman said. "A distinguished pilot who flew 149 combat missions in
two wars, and the first American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn is synonymous
with that long Ohio tradition of aviation excellence which is on display in
Columbus. It is an honor to serve, as he did, as a United States Senator from
Ohio, and to serve on the advisory board of the John Glenn College of Public
Affairs, one of the best public affairs schools in the country. Above all it has
been an honor to be his friend. Jane and I congratulate John and Annie, and we
commend the Ohio legislature for working on a bipartisan basis to honor this
great Ohioan."



 NOTE: Senator Portman paid tribute to former Senator Glenn and expressed his
support for the renaming of Port Columbus Airport in the Congressional Record on
June 23, 2016. At the renaming ceremony, a video was shown of Senator Portman
speaking about Senator Glenn.



 Portman Questions Administration, Says Proposed Medicare Part B Demonstration
Project May Increase Opioid Abuse



 Portman, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, questioned Dr. Patrick
Conway, Acting Principal Deputy Administrator at the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, during a hearing to examine the administration's proposed
Medicare Part B demonstration. Specifically, Portman asked if the
administration's proposal actually contains incentives for physicians to
increase the prescription of opioids, saying that there is a "dramatic increase
in reimbursement incentives for the kinds of pain medication that is addicting
and is causing much of the problem." Portman's Senate-passed, bipartisan
Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) deals with overprescribing though
enhanced drug monitoring as well as targeted education and prevention efforts.
It is said that four out of five heroin addictions who die from drug overdoses
started out on prescription drugs. For that reason, Portman has been adamant
that we must stop prescription drug abuse if we are to help the 129 a day who
are losing their lives to drug overdoses.



 Transcript of Portman's questioning can be found here and a video can be found
here.





 Portman and Brown Urge Action to Protect Pensions of Ohio Miners



 Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) called on Senate leaders to protect the
hard-earned pensions of our nation's coalminers. Despite having a bipartisan,
fully-paid-for solution to save the United Mine Workers of America's (UMWA)
pensions, the Senate has yet to hold a vote. The Senators pointed out that as
the Senate prepares to vote on relief for Puerto Rico, Ohio mineworkers should
also be a top priority.  Portman and Brown, both members of the U.S. Senate
Finance Committee, renewed their call to pass their legislation during a
colloquy on the Senate Floor with their colleagues U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin (D- W.
Va.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN) in a colloquy on
the Senate Floor.



 "If we're going to help Puerto Rico escape bankruptcy, we should also be
helping the 90,000 coal miners in Ohio, West Virginia and elsewhere who are also
suffering the effects of the coal bankruptcies," said Portman.  "These coal
miners spent their careers in dangerous jobs that resulted in higher rates of
injury, disease, and cancer. The Miners Protection Act would protect the health
and pension benefits that they have earned, and it's long past time for us to
vote on this common-sense measure."



 Portman and Brown are cosponsors of the Miners Protection Act to address the
shortfall in the UMWA 1974 pension plan. The UMWA's 1974 pension plan was 94
percent funded prior to 2008. Due to many factors including the financial crisis
and fewer active workers, the plan is now severely underfunded - putting the
health care and benefits of retirees in jeopardy. If the plan becomes insolvent,
retirees could lose their health care and see reductions in their monthly
pension checks.



 Portman Delivers Remarks Supporting Bipartisan Legislation to Help Ohio Miners



 Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor supporting a bipartisan amendment
offered to the House-passed Puerto Rico bankruptcy legislation to protect Ohio
mineworkers. The amendment, based on the Miners Protection Act, introduced by
Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), would protect the
pension and health benefits of retired miners and their dependents and honor the
promises that were made to them. Portman made clear that he will vote against
cloture on the Puerto Rico legislation unless a vote is secured for the Miners
Protection Act.

 Calling on House-Senate Conferees to Reach an Agreement on CARA



 Portman joined Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and
Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) in releasing this letter to the House and Senate conferees
negotiating a joint House-Senate agreement on legislation to address the
nation's opioid addiction crisis.  The group of Senators worked together closely
to craft the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed the Senate
in March by a vote of 94-1 and is in the process of being merged with House
addiction legislation passed in May.

 Urging the DHS & CBP to Promote Transparency, Accountability in Implementing
the ENFORCE Act



 Portman, Brown, Roy Blunt (R-MO), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Ben Cardin (D-MD)
urged the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) to create a process that promotes transparency, partnership
with interested parties, and accountability when implementing the ENFORCE Act.
The ENFORCE Act, signed into law in February as part of the Customs Bill, is
designed help to stop foreign competitors from illegally importing goods by
setting up a process that gives domestic producers an opportunity to formally
petition Customs and Border Protection to investigate possible antidumping and
countervailing duty evasions, a top priority for American manufacturers.



 The letter makes clear that more transparency and accountability, as well as
meaningful participation by all parties, will lead to better decision-making:



 "The IFR (Interim Final Regulations) should ensure that all interested parties,
including U.S. businesses and workers, can submit information, have access to
the information submitted by other parties and a meaningful opportunity to
comment on all of the information that CBP will rely on in making its
determination.  Simply accepting complaints from U.S. companies or workers is
insufficient.  They have a direct interest in the outcome of these proceedings
and the expertise to assist with enforcement.  Access to information will
promote meaningful participation by all interested parties which will only lead
to higher quality decisions."



 Full text of the letter can be found here.



 Helping Seniors Address Rising Health Care Costs



 Portman and Brown introduced bipartisan legislation to help seniors with rising
health care costs by maintaining the threshold to claim the medical expense tax
deduction for seniors at the current rate of 7.5 percent of income for an
additional two years.  If no action is taken, the threshold to claim the
deduction will rise to 10 percent of income on January 1, 2017, raising health
care costs for seniors.



 "The rising cost of health care is a critical issue for every American, but
especially for seniors who live on fixed incomes.  And since seniors are often
faced with higher medical expenses, this deduction provides important tax relief
to help offset many of these costs," Portman stated. "I want to express my
thanks to Senator Brown for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to
working with him to advance this bipartisan proposal."



 AARP has endorsed the legislation, saying in a letter that it is "especially
important to middle income seniors with high medical costs":



 "AARP believes every effort should be made to keep the threshold for the
medical expense deduction as low as possible to help protect people with high
health care costs," said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins in the letter. "This is
consistent with our long stated goal to increase healthcare access and
affordability for all Americans.  For these reasons and others, we are pleased
to endorse your legislation and look forward to working on a bipartisan basis
with you to enact this legislation into law."



 Standing up for Ohio Workers & Retirees



 Portman expressed his disappointment that the United States Senate invoked
cloture on the Puerto Rico bankruptcy bill without any legislation helping Ohio
workers and retirees.



 "If we're going to help Puerto Rico escape bankruptcy, we should also be
helping the tens of thousands of Teamsters, Ironworkers, and others whose
pensions are at risk, and the 90,000 coal miners in Ohio, West Virginia and
elsewhere who are also suffering the effects of the coal bankruptcies," Portman
said. "They deserve a vote. I can't support this bill without helping Ohio
workers and retirees at the same time."



 NOTE: Yesterday, Senator Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor
supporting a bipartisan amendment offered to the House-passed Puerto Rico
bankruptcy legislation to protect Ohio mineworkers. The amendment, based on the
Miners Protection Act, introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley
Moore Capito (R-WV), would protect the pension and health benefits of retired
miners and their dependents and honor the promises that were made to them.
Portman made clear that he will vote against cloture on the Puerto Rico
legislation unless a vote is secured for the Miners Protection Act.



 Senator Portman also offered his Pension Accountability Act as an amendment,
which would protect pensioners from having their hard-earned benefits cut with
no say in the process. For struggling pension plans seeking cuts, it would make
the participant vote binding in all situations. Their majority vote will be
required for any pension cuts to occur. Further, Portman's legislation will make
this vote fair by counting only the ballots that are returned. Unreturned
ballots will no longer be counted as a "yes" vote.



 Bringing the Delta Queen back to the Ohio River



 Portman and Brown announced that the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce,
Science, and Transportation passed their bipartisan bill that would clear the
way for the Delta Queen to return to the Ohio River. The bill would allow the
Delta Queen steamboat to carry passengers on overnight trips on the Ohio and
Mississippi Rivers.



 "The Delta Queen is a true Ohio treasure and an important part of the Queen
City's history.  I remember being on the Delta Queen as a boy and am pleased
that this measure to keep it afloat is moving forward" Portman said. "This
legislation will make sure the vessel can get back in business and help promote
recreational activities and economic activity along the Ohio River, including in
Cincinnati."



 The 1966 Safety at Sea law prohibits wooden ships of a certain size - like the
Delta Queen - from carrying passengers on overnight trips. The bill would allow
the ship to carry overnight passengers if safety improvements and annual
structural alterations are made to the parts of these ships that are not
fire-retardant.



 The Delta Queen, designated as a National Historic Landmark, is currently
undergoing renovations and safety improvements in Houma, Louisiana, but was
owned by a Cincinnati company from 1946-1985.



 Experts Agree With Portman that 910th AW in Youngstown Should Play Role in
Effort to Combat Zika



 Portman, a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee,
questioned Zika experts on how Department of Defense assets can better be
utilized to combat the outbreak and spread of biological threats such as the
Zika virus. Specifically, Portman called for the 910th AW in Youngstown, with
its special aerial spray mission capability, to be modernized and upgraded so
that the federal government can play a more effective role in helping combat the
spread of Zika.



 Portman has repeatedly urged the Department of Defense to better use the assets
available to them at the 910th. Portman has urged a comprehensive strategy and
backed aggressive efforts to fight the Zika virus, as he detailed in a recent
op-ed.



 The transcript of his remarks can be found here and a video can be found here.



 On CARA: Let's Put Politics Aside and Get Something Done



 Portman returned to the Senate floor for the 11th straight week that the Senate
has been in session as part of his tireless effort to combat the heroin epidemic
devastating communities across Ohio and the country.



 On Wednesday night, Portman focused on troubling reports that White House
officials who have strongly supported and even helped draft Portman's
Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) are now playing political games
with this urgently needed legislation.



 Portman also recounted the stories of Ohioans he had spoken to who are in
recovery from addiction or who had lost loved ones to drug overdoses.



 To help the thousands of families suffering from the disease of addiction,
Portman pressed Congress to "put politics aside and actually get something done
here." CARA, which passed the Senate by a 94-1 vote, is not only backed by Obama
Administration experts but also by more than 130 national anti-drug groups.



 Transcript of his floor speech can be found here and a full video of his
remarks can be found here.



 As Portman continues to put the national spotlight on the prescription and
heroin epidemic devastating our communities, he has not let up in his
determination to back up his call to action with action of his own. In fact,
recently, at Portman's urging, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved
legislation that would nearly double federal funding for opioid abuse programs.
Portman has also recently visited with women and their children in recovery in
Cincinnati, spoke at an Opiate conference in Columbus, held a field hearing in
Cleveland, visited recovering addicts in Dayton, held two CARA related events in
Akron, met with homeless youth in recovery in Columbus, women in recovery in
Athens and delivered remarks about CARA in Youngstown all in an ongoing push to
raise awareness on the importance of this legislation. Portman has previously
detailed how CARA, which combats the drug epidemic by helping promote education
and prevention to stop drug abuse before it begins, addresses the demand side of
the drug epidemic, promotes treatment alternatives and reverse overdoses, helps
veterans, and helps women and babies, as Senator Portman wrote in the Washington
Examiner in February.

 Securing a Vote on the Miner's Protection Act



 Portman and Brown announced they had secured a commitment from Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) to hold a committee markup and vote on the
Miner's Protection Act - which would protect the hard-earned pensions of our
nation's coalminers - as early as next month and no later than September.  The
commitment to hold a vote came after Portman and Brown and a group of bipartisan
Senators made clear they would oppose moving forward on legislation to help
Puerto Rico unless the Senate also made mineworkers in Ohio, West Virginia, and
elsewhere a top priority.



 "I've said all along: If we're going to help Puerto Rico, we should also be
helping the 90,000 coal miners in Ohio, West Virginia who need help as well,"
said Portman.  "This is a victory for our coalminers and I believe the Senate
Finance Committee will approve the measure on a bipartisan basis. We must
protect the health and pension benefits that our miners have earned, and I will
continue to work with Senator Brown and our colleagues on a bipartisan basis
until this bill becomes law."



 NOTE: Portman and Brown, both members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee,
renewed their call to pass the Miner's Protection Act during a colloquy on the
Senate Floor with their bipartisan colleagues this week.  Portman and Brown are
cosponsors of the Miners Protection Act to address the shortfall in the UMWA
1974 pension plan.  The UMWA's 1974 pension plan was 94 percent funded prior to
2008. Due to many factors including the financial crisis and fewer active
workers, the plan is now severely underfunded - putting the health care and
benefits of retirees in jeopardy. If the plan becomes insolvent, retirees could
lose their health care and see reductions in their monthly pension checks.
Despite the fact that the Miner's Protection Act is a bipartisan, fully-paid-for
solution to save the United Mine Workers of America's (UMWA) pensions, the
Senate has yet to hold a vote.



 Statement on GE Aviation Winning $1 Billion Air Force Contract



 Portman issued the following statement congratulating GE Aviation after the Air
Force awarded it a $1 billion contract to continue maturing its three-stream
adaptive cycle engine through its Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP):



 "I want to congratulate GE Aviation and their employees in Evendale for winning
a contract to develop the Air Force's next generation engines.  This program is
critical to maintaining America's technological edge, and I am pleased that so
much of this work will be performed in the Cincinnati area. This project will
lead to increased investment in the region, which will help spur further
economic growth, job creation and innovation, while enhancing Ohio's reputation
as a national leader in aerospace and defense."

 Honoring a Fallen Hero



 Portman hosted a ceremony to announce the dedication of the Specialist Joseph
W. Riley's Grove City Post Office. Portman was joined by members of the Riley
family and community leaders. &lrm;



 Army Specialist Riley was a Grove City native who died on November 24, 2014, in
Kabul Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Portman
sponsored legislation in the U.S. Senate to rename the United States Postal
Service facility located in Grove City, Ohio after SPC Riley. The legislation
was signed into law by President Obama in March.



 Specialist Riley enlisted in the Army in June 2012; he was assigned to 1st
Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd
Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, North Carolina in March 2013. His awards and
decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army commendation
Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star,
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service
Ribbon, NATO medal, Combat Infantryman Badge and Basic Parachutist Badge.

Where's east Contra Costa health care district's money going?

BYLINE: By Rick Radin Contra Costa Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 733 words


PITTSBURG -- East Contra Costa's only taxpayer-supported health care district is
proposing to spend less than half its budget this fiscal year on the community
programs it was set up to support, just a year after a civil grand jury
criticized it for not directing more money toward serving residents.

The rest of the 2011-12 budget would go toward district expenses such as
employee wages and board compensation, legal services and strategic planning.

The Los Medanos Community Healthcare District is budgeting $405,422 for its own
expenses compared with $325,879 on grants to community nonprofits and an
eyeglass program for needy schoolchildren.

The district is proposing to spend $164,000 on wages in 2011-12, including a
$100,000 annual salary for Administrator Bobbie Palmer, who has moved from part
time to full time. That is roughly double what it spent on district wages last
year.

Palmer was formerly receiving $48,000 a year for a 20-hour-a-week position.

Palmer declined to comment on the budget, including questions about her salary
and a plan to spend $4,500 to buy Apple iPads for each board member so they can
communicate with each other.

"Somebody just said 'I want an iPad, how about the rest of you guys?' " said Joe
Rubi, a former board member and a longtime critic of the current board. "They
already have email, home phones and cellphones, so why do they need iPads?
That's a luxury item."

The district was the subject of a 2010 civil grand jury report that criticized
trustees for spending an average of half of its revenue from 2006 to 2009 on
community programs.

In response to the report, the district produced a balance sheet that showed it
spent about 69 percent of its budget on programs during those years.

The district has budgeted 44 percent of revenues on programs this year, compared
with 49 percent last year. About 73 percent of district residents are in
Pittsburg, 22 percent in Bay Point and close to 5 percent in four other
communities. The district is funded through a 1 percent property tax assessment.
A recent grand jury report also criticized the Mount Diablo Healthcare District,
a similar special district, for spending only 10 percent on programs out of the
$2.45 million it collected from 2000 to 2009.

Los Medanos board member Eva Zendejas Vera said Palmer's position has always
been full time, but she's been paid a half-time salary in the past.

The five board members will continue to receive about $4,800 each in annual
stipends for attending two meetings a month. Vera said the district has been
struggling with a loss of property tax revenue. Los Medanos had more than $1
million in revenues in 2007-08 and 2008-09 compared with $731,400 in 2011-12.

"We get our money from property tax, but our expenses have stayed the same,"
Vera said.

Board members Marilyn Condit, Linda Strong, Vern Cromartie and board President
Darnell Turner did not respond to requests for comment on the district's
spending.

"(Board members) are doing all they can to not say anything about what's going
on," Rubi said. "If you challenge them, they just get mad and chew you out."

The board is scheduled to discuss the budget at Monday's meeting.

"This shows a very cavalier attitude toward the people's money," said Kris Hunt,
of the Contra Costa Taxpayers' Association, which had a representative at the
district's July 18 budget meeting. "This (assessment) is an item that's hidden
away on the property tax bill."

Among the 16 nonprofit groups receiving annual funding are Delta Memorial
Hospital Foundation, Delta 2000/Bay Point All-Star Cheerleading and East County
Midnight Basketball.

The largest beneficiary in 2010-11 was John Muir Community Health Alliance,
which received $146,222 to provide blood pressure and diabetes checks for
minority residents and information about health care options.

Vera acknowledged that "two or three" of the nonprofits have not returned
required documentation verifying that they have spent the money as intended.

"They're not doing their program, obviously," Vera said. "We would like them to
return the money."

Despite the criticisms, incumbents Condit and Vera were re-elected in November.
Strong was the only challenger to win a seat.

Three other challengers, including Rubi, were defeated.

Much ado

I am enraged that 13-year-old Tiffany Tropp of Concord, N.H., has already lost
her sense of joy and good will. She seems more concerned with causing strife in
a school that respects the Jewish religion and the Christian religion than in
enjoying the holiday spirit. I am happy that most people conceive of the
holidays as a time of joy instead of as an opportunity to create division.

Aging disgrace

A recent editorial about Social Security was flawed. Life expectancy does not
reflect real lifespans. Life expectancy is wishful thinking. A "boomer" born in
1948 "reaching the year of 2050" would be 102 years old. How many centenarians
do you know? Second, I know of few, if any, employers who would hire a
60-year-old, much less a 65-year-old. If the government raises the retirement
age, what do these 60-something "boomers" do for income assistance? It is
well-known that companies "purge" their work force of employees 55 or older.

College costs

After reading Dr. Marilyn Gootman's op-ed piece on the HOPE scholarship program,
I felt compelled to write. I, too, am an educator. I teach high school. I have
two teenage children as well. Frankly, I am enraged by Dr. Gootman's quote that
those of us in the $ 66,000 salary range can "well afford the reasonable tuition
at state educational institutions."

Tuition is only one aspect of the cost of a college education. There are also
books, living expenses and miscellaneous costs as well as the normal expenses of
having children. My "middle-class" income pays taxes to support people who are
on welfare, Social Security and Medicare as well as public education. Plus, my
husband and I must put something aside for our retirement.

I have a comfortable lifestyle. There is no denying that. But my husband and I
work very hard for that lifestyle. I am happy to bite the bullet on budget
reform, and I feel the strong need for national health reform.

But lottery money is not money that is taxed from the public. I feel it is time
that the poor and middle class alike had some kind of benefit, especially one
that does not cost the taxpayer one cent.

I will soon have two children in college. It appears that it will cost $ 6,000
per year, per child. That is $ 48,000 over five years. How many people in my
economic situation have an extra $ 48,000?

I do agree with Dr. Gootman on one point. I think a $ 100,000 income cap is
excessive. I would cap the HOPE scholarship at $ 75,000. Dr. Gootman needs to
come down from her academic ivory tower and walk a mile in the shoes of a high
school teacher with two teenage children.

We must invest more in saving our children

Recent incidents at the Fulton County children's emergency shelter are no
surprise to those who care for children in shelters and group homes across the
state.

If the state of Georgia funded the infrastructure of its highway system like it
funds the infrastructure of its child welfare system, it would be in a state of
disarray. The state would be the laughingstock of the country if it asked road
contractors to accept only 40 cents on the dollar to build a highway. The state
is doing exactly that in the care of its neglected, abandoned and abused youth.

The Department of Human Resources has asked the governor to increase the
reimbursement from 40 percent to 50 percent of the cost of caring for these
children.

The children's infrastructure is strained to the breaking point. More than 1,500
youths are in need of services. And these children are much more troubled than
children were a decade ago. Georgia's at-risk children typically fall their way
through the system. In the name of finding the least restrictive placement, a
child is often placed in the least expensive placement, and most often not the
most appropriate placement. Usually, the appropriate placement is too little too
late.

When a child falls in the system, we send a message to the child that he or she
cannot succeed and is therefore a failure. We tell the child that adults cannot
be trusted and that relationships are not permanent. These lessons often
continue for a lifetime.

The needs we do not meet now in a child's life will have devastating
consequences later. Our failure to protect children will erupt into senseless
violence, hopeless lifestyles and failed families.

Our children must be more important than our roads.

Ready to fly

I read the recent account of "price-skirmishing" between Delta Air Lines and
upstart ValuJet with great interest.

I am a longtime Delta customer and advocate. I have always been impressed with
the airline's efficiency and spirit. I always choose Delta when possible.

However, Delta has punished Savannah-to-Atlanta travelers long enough. It is a
painfully expensive leg. We are a captive audience and Delta knows it.

I hope ValuJet will consider Savannah in the near future. Increased access would
benefit us all.

Clinton's folly

I take exception to the recent editorial titled "Rumor takes on a life of its
own." You state that the two Arkansas troopers hope to make big bucks on a book
contract - that is unsubstantiated. Why cast such doubt on the credibility of
two troopers who have given long service and were in a position to know what was
going on?

You state that the latest allegations are of no more importance than those
regarding Gennifer Flowers and are immaterial since Clinton was elected
president.

But we should always take into consideration allegations that may indicate a
flaw in the character of one serving in the highest position in our government.
Remember Watergate.

People do care

The news media need to stop taking the position that all Americans accept Bill
Clinton's indiscretions. I think some Americans were gullible during the
election and believed that the tryst with Gennifer Flowers was a temporary flaw
in this man's moral makeup during a trying period of his marriage. It is true
that many marriages go through upheavals, but the problems are either resolved
or the marriage is ended. It is a different matter when infidelity becomes a
part of life, which is something the public was not made aware of during the
campaign.

Bill Clinton likes to compare himself to John Kennedy, and in that respect there
is a similarity. I admit that I voted for and respected Kennedy, but after his
death, when all the "rumors" about him became public, I felt cheated and
betrayed because I had not known the true person he was. Had I known all of
those facts before his election, I certainly would not have voted for him.

The same thing applies to Bill Clinton and the way many Americans perceive him
now that the "rumors" have been made public.

JOAN ADAMS

Make that change

[Regarding the recent report of the National School Boards Association:]

A truism often repeated by all serious participants in the civil rights movement
was, "You can legislate the behavior of people, but you cannot change their
thinking by making a law."

The schools and churches are needed to help change the thinking of people. The
deterioration in living conditions and the violence that we all encounter cannot
be dealt with by making new laws, but only by changing the hearts and minds of
our citizens. This is something that churches and schools have done well in the
past and I see no reason why they cannot do it again.

Price is a professor of political science at Morris Brown College.

Agriculture is a creature of evolution

As a South Georgia farmer, a resident of the "cozy" world of peanut farming, I
feel compelled to respond to the recent editorial titled "Lessons of the kiwi."

I agree with two assertions you make: "Change is coming because the United
States is promoting free trade with other countries," and, "State government has
an obligation to get moving to help South Georgia."

It is the contention of many of my reactionary, "antiquated system" proponent
friends that fair trade promotion rather than free trade would better serve all
Americans. We were among those rural voices that rose up in protest to the
funding cuts the Co-operative Extension Service, the Agricultural Research
Stations, and the University of Georgia's College of Agriculture and
Environmental Sciences experienced in the 1992 budget.

Agriculture is a creature of evolution, not revolution, and will continue to
evolve as conditions make positive change necessary. Few constants in production
agriculture exist, but fortunately for South Georgia, profitable peanut crops
most years have helped sustain some farmers through the past 16 years of fickle
weather and low market prices. I can well remember buying the Sunday
Journal-Constitution for less than a dollar when peanuts were $ 500 per ton and
cotton was 65 cents per pound. Today, your paper costs $ 1.75, peanuts are $ 675
and cotton is 61 cents. We do not have the luxury of passing increased costs on
to our customers.

Most of rural America is looking for survival rather than prosperity.

Kiwi, organic crops, Vidalia onions, Habersham wines, natural herbs and
blueberries are examples of intense-promotion, limited-market- potential,
low-acreage ventures that can be profitable on a small scale but cannot replace
the large acreages of traditional row crops without destroying the profitability
of the specialty crops.

Programmers sought to help solve state's water woes

BYLINE: Reed Fujii, The Record, Stockton, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 559 words


Jan. 11--Looking to cultivate technical innovation and address vital
water-supply issues facing drought-stricken California, the newly formed
Innovation Hub San Joaquin board announced Thursday its H2O Hackathon to be held
March 27-28 in Stockton.

Students and budding technologists with skills in programming, engineering and
software development are invited to join in an intense 22-hour session of
brainstorming and coding to solve some key challenges in water management. Among
the specific goals suggested:

--Create a smart systems that can record data as groundwater basins are
replenished by rainstorms as well as calculate how much water was not collected
during a given storm.

--Design an interactive mapping system for municipal water systems, allowing
utilities workers and others easy access to existing maps to identify lines and
key infrastructure, such as valves, as well as letting them correct the maps on
the fly so that they are as accurate as possible.

--Create a real time San Joaquin Delta monitoring system that can more
accurately record and calculate Delta outflows than existing systems, providing
water managers better answers when it comes to allocating water supplies.

David Nelson, chairman of iHub San Joaquin, said the aim of the hackathon is to
show that technical expertise and innovation exists in the San Joaquin Valley,
as well as in the adjoining Silicon Valley and to potentially come up with some
great new technology as well.

"We've got a lot of smart young people here who are looking to solve problems,"
he said. "My hope is will come up with one or two really great solutions from
the hackathon that will make it well worth it."

Announced by state and county officials in October 2013, iHub San Joaquin is one
of 16 designated innovation locales in the state. An agreement signed in
November between the state, county and Business Incubator and Innovation Center,
an affiliate of the AG Spanos Cos. of Stockton, signaled its formal
establishment. Nelson is vice president of land development for Spanos.

The Stockton-based hub is particularly dedicated to advancing technologies and
businesses in the areas of health care, sustainable construction and
agribusiness.

Nelson said as the nonprofit group develops programs, as well as additional
funding, possibly though donations, grants and, potentially, state government
support, it looks to create services to support innovative entrepreneurs,
through a marshalling of area incubator resources and business mentoring
services.

The H2O Hackathon gives participants from 10 a.m. March 27 through 8 a.m. March
28 to develop their ideas, while judging will run through 11 a.m. the same day.
Those attending a public brunch March 28 may vote on an audience favorite among
the hackathon technologies and all winners will be announced by 2 p.m.

Hackathon participants will retain full intellectual properties rights to apps
or other systems produced during the event, but have to agree to allow the iHub
to use them for promotion and marketing.

Hackathon entry is free. For members of the general public, entry to the March
28 brunch is $30.

Georgia plans job fair, claims help for jobless

BYLINE: TAMMY JOYNER

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: News; Pg. 16A

LENGTH: 354 words


Metro Atlanta airline and hospitality workers who have lost their jobs recently
will get one-stop help with unemployment claims and other services beginning
next week.

The Georgia Department of Labor will take first-time claims and hold a job fair
in Clayton County for those workers Monday and Tuesday. Participants also can
apply for health care coverage for their children and seek money to go back to
school. The event, at the Georgia International Convention Center, 1902 Sullivan
Road in College Park, will be repeated Nov. 19-20.

"This is a beginning of our state's response to the economic impact of Sept.
11," Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond said. The department has been swamped
with layoffs most of this year, but says it has yet to see the full impact of
the Sept. 11 attacks.

About two dozen Labor Department workers, redirected from other field offices,
will process first-time claims at the temporary site from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The
job fair is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.

MCI, Waffle House, the Atlanta Police Department, United Parcel Service, Georgia
Power, Primerica Financial Services and Federal Express are among the more than
20 companies planning to recruit.

Representatives from PeachCare, the state-run health insurance program for
children, The Department of Technical and Adult Education and the Hope Grant
foundation also will be on hand.

A special office, intended to provide laid-off workers with ongoing services
only, will open Wednesday in the former Clayton County field office. It will not
take initial unemployment claims. The transition center, at 1193 Forest Parkway
in Lake City, will be open for about a year. Full service is available at the
field office at 2450 Mount Zion Parkway in Jonesboro.

Delta Air Lines plans to trim about 13,000 jobs through early retirement,
voluntary leave, and severance. By law, workers who get severance packages or
some other form of compensation must exhaust those payments before they can get
unemployment compensation.

Each case will be judged individually to determine qualification for
compensation, Thurmond said.

ADP, county group get grant of $2.4 million

The OneGeorgia Authority voted Wednesday to award the Develop-ment Authority of
Rich-mond County and Auto-ma-tic Data Processing a $2.4 million grant to defray
the costs of the payroll company's building on Flowing Wells Road.

ADP opened the $36 million, 160,000-square-foot building in 2009. The grant
money is tied to the second phase of hiring at ADP. The company has already
hired 450 people, according to the state, and expects to hire 550 more by the
end of 2012.

Ford's payments will cut debt by $4 billion

DETROIT - Ford Motor Co. said Wednesday it will reduce its huge debt by an
additional $4 billion as it continues to show signs of financial strength.

The automaker will pay $3.8 billion in cash to a United Auto Workers trust fund
that pays retiree health care bills, and it will pay out $255 million in
dividends on preferred securities that had been deferred. Ford will still owe
the UAW trust about $3.6 billion, due by 2022.

The automaker said the actions combined with a $3 billion debt payment in April
will cut its total debt to around $27 billion.

Overdraft rule offers way to cut bank fees

NEW YORK - Beginning today, banks must get permission from customers before they
can charge a fee for covering a debit card purchase or ATM withdrawal if there
aren't sufficient funds in the account.

Initially, the rule only applies to new customers. Existing accountholders will
be included starting Aug. 15.

If consumers forgo overdraft coverage, banks stand to lose a large chunk of
income. The fees brought in more than $37 billion last year, estimated economist
and consultant Mike Moebs.

Former AIG executive denies relaxing rules

WASHINGTON - A former top executive of American International Group Inc.
acknowledged Wednesday that his division more than tripled the amount of risky
investments it insured in the three years leading up to the 2008 financial
meltdown.

But Joseph Cassano, the chief executive for AIG's key Financial Products
division, rebuffed accusations from a special panel investigating the crisis
that he relaxed standards to issue more credit default swaps.

AIG received a $182 billion taxpayer bailout after it nearly collapsed and
helped trigger the financial crisis.

Amazon.com has purchased deal-a-day site Woot.com. In a joke-tinged post on the
company blog, Woot CEO Matt Rutledge said the deal won't change how the site is
run - "with a wall of ideas and a dartboard."

Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said Wednesday his company "is ready to
move on" with union elections that are expected to follow a rule change today.
But the company said it will stand with the Air Transport Asso-ciation if it
decides to appeal the ruling that would make it easier for workers to unionize.

S. Abbas Shobeiri has been named chief of female pelvic medicine and
reconstructive surgery and director of women's pelvic and bladder health at OU
Physicians.

He is Oklahoma's first fellowship-trained urogynecologist, which means he
specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of female bladder, bowel and
reproductive organs.

Patients suffering with uterovaginal prolapse (weakness of female reproductive
organs), pelvic prolapse, urinary or fecal incontinence and fistulas (abnormal
connections between various pelvic organs) can be referred to Shobeiri for
further evaluation.

Shobeiri has published numerous scientific articles and continues to teach
courses on female pelvic medicine, anatomy of the female bladder and urethra,
chronic pelvic pain and various advanced urinary and fecal incontinence
treatment procedures.

Dermatologist Pamela S. Allen has established her practice with OU Physicians.

In addition to seeing patients at OU Physicians Dermatology offices on the OU
Health Sciences Center campus, Allen has been named medical director of the OU
Physicians-Enid Dermatology Clinic and will see patients there twice a week.

Sports Science & Orthopaedics

Darryl D. Robinson has joined Oklahoma Sports Science & Orthopaedics at the
clinic in The Physicians' Group Medical Plaza, 10001 S. Western Ave.

Robinson specializes in the treatment of nonsurgical musculoskeletal conditions,
electrodiagnostic medicine and pain management.

Edmond Medical Center

Kent Smalley has joined the staff of Edmond Medical Center. Smalley is a
neurologist who specializes in treating pain, headaches, spine pain and general
neurology and is experienced in electromyography.

His Edmond office is called Edmond Headache and Pain Clinic and is located at
609 S. Kelly Ave.

New heart treatment

Ashley Wolford, a young girl from Oklahoma, has become one of the first people
in the country to undergo a new, minimally invasive procedure to repair a heart.

Shortly after birth, Wolford, who just turned 6 in July, was diagnosed with a
condition called Atrial Septal Defect. This defect is a hole between the top two
chambers of the heart that results in the mixing of oxygenated and de-oxygenated
blood, causing the heart to work harder.

At the time, the only choice to repair the disorder was an invasive and risky
open-heart surgery. However, when Kent Ward, a pediatric cardiologist at The
Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center told the girl's parents that new
treatments were in development and Wolford did not need immediate treatment, her
parents decided to wait.

Four years later, Jeremy Ringewald used an Amplatzer Septal Occluder to fix the
defect.

The Amplatzer, a small double-disc wire mesh device, can easily be implanted
through a small catheter inserted in a vein in the patient's groin. The doctor
navigates the catheter through the vein to the location of the defect in the
heart where the Amplatzer is then deployed. The heart's tissue then grows over
the Amplatzer, permanently sealing the hole. The procedure lasts one to two
hours.

It has been several months since Wolford underwent her procedure. She has no
restrictions and enjoys playing with her friends.

OSU Center for Health Sciences

Oklahoma State University has been awarded a $1 million, three-year Health
Careers Opportunity Program grant to encourage disadvantaged students to pursue
medical careers.

The project provides stipends to eligible students from middle school through
post-college. Qualified students may also attend specialized academic academies
that focus on preparing students for medical study.

History of Medicine Collection

Rare books, antique doctors' bags, medical instruments and microscopes of the
past are just a few of the items that will be unveiled at a preview of the
History of Medicine Collection at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center at 4 p.m. today.

Housed on the fourth floor of the Robert M. Bird Health Sciences Library, the
collection contains materials used for identification and treatment of diseases.
Students and physicians are expected to use the books to study the origins of
diseases and to study the evolution of health care.

A grant from the Presbyterian Health Foundation made it possible for an area in
the library to be remodeled to house the collection.

Delta Dental

Delta Dental Plan of Oklahoma Charitable Foundation has donated $14,500 to Good
Shepherd Mission Dental Clinic.

The Good Shepherd Mission Dental Clinic is a joint venture of the First Baptist
Church of Downtown Oklahoma City, the University of Oklahoma College of
Dentistry, and local community volunteers. The mission provides dental care to
the poor, free of charge.

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... We also hoped to give health law students an opportunity to learn about the
health-related legal issues of individuals in low-resourced communities as part
of UM Carey Law's ongoing mission to meet the "third apprenticeship" of legal
education identified by the Carnegie Foundation as the place where knowledge,
skills, and the social-ethical dimensions of lawyering come together to help
students bridge the gap from law school to practice.  ... A professor at Saint
Louis University School of Law created a service-learning component for her
Disability Law course, which involved getting the city to cut sidewalk curbs
near the law school for improved access by disabled people, and she observed
that doing the project "benefitted me in many of the same ways it did my
students." ... To accommodate the growing number of students who wanted to
participate annually, MLSC moved from providing a single placement to offering
several different "trips" to the Gulf Coast region that students can choose
from.  ... When approaching an organization that does not have this experience,
it would be useful to have concrete suggestions as to what a group of students
can accomplish in a week's time; whether students will conduct research before
they leave; the knowledge base of the students based on which year of law school
they are in and the courses they have taken; and the amount of supervision and
work faculty members will provide to the project.  ... My early conversations
with MCJ involved identifying health-related issues that the attorneys were
working on but also eliminating issues that were particularly time sensitive and
those that required skills beyond the students' abilities.  ... We agreed that
students would conduct research on hospital charity care and debt collection
practices and help administer surveys in the Delta.

   -Delta Native B.B. King's "Inflation Blues"

Proving what the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge said was true, that "nothing is so
contagious as enthusiasm," Law & Health Care Program (L&HCP) faculty at the
University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law (UM Carey Law) were
infected with the enthusiasm generated by student-led trips to the Gulf Coast
organized after Hurricane Katrina. In 2010, Diane Hoffmann, the Director of the
Law & Health Care Program, and I decided to build on the energy and enthusiasm
of these trips by creating a co-curricular health law-focused service trip that
would provide a structured opportunity for health law students to practice law
in their future field of expertise. We also hoped to give health law students an
opportunity to learn about the health-related legal issues of individuals in
low-resourced communities as part of UM Carey Law's ongoing mission to meet the
"third apprenticeship" of legal education identified by the Carnegie Foundation
as the place where knowledge, skills, and the social-ethical dimensions of
lawyering come together to help students bridge the gap from law school to
practice.  n1

Mississippi to partner with the Mississippi Center for Justice in what has
turned out to be a wonderfully successful self-sustaining student-run service
trip for health law students. This essay is a how-to guide (with a dose of
analytical framework) for health law faculty interested in creating a similar
experience for their students. In the paragraphs that follow, I set forth the
model we have developed for the service trip and the successes and challenges we
have faced. My hope is that our enthusiasm for this type of trip will be
contagious as well.

Background: Service Learning in the Law School Setting
The dual pedagogical goals of skills training and social justice awareness have
been a valued component of legal education for decades, primarily through
clinical legal education.  n2 In the last decade, legal academics have called
for the kind of experiential learning that takes place in clinics and externship
programs to permeate the law school curriculum.  n3 This growing movement was
the focus of a call for papers by the Association for American Law School's
(AALS) Section on Pro Bono and Public Service Opportunities for the 2011 Annual
Meeting. The program, titled "Beyond Externships and Clinics: Best Practices for
Integrating Access to Justice Education," was designed to explore curricular and
co-curricular models of access-to-justice education that can be integrated into
legal education beyond in-house clinics  [*402]  and externship programs.  n4
One way that these goals are finding their way into law school curricula and
co-curricular activities is through a service-learning pedagogical approach.

   Service learning is an educational model that is widely used in the American
educational system, but it has not been adopted widely in the law school
setting. There is some fuzziness in the sparse literature on the issue as to the
whether there is a difference between service learning and clinical education.
One recent paper addressing service learning in the field of environmental law
called clinical legal education "law school's contribution to service learning"
and stated that "clinical legal education has been the primary vehicle for
service learning within the law school curriculum."  n5 However, others have
noted that clinical legal education and service learning are separate
pedagogical models: the former grounded in theories of promoting social justice
and professional responsibility and the latter on civic engagement.  n6 Another
overlap exists between service learning and the pro bono activities required or
encouraged of students at most law schools. The American Bar Association (ABA)
and AALS take the position that law schools "shall offer substantial
opportunities for student participation in pro bono activities."  n7

   In 2010, [we] decided to build on the energy and enthusiasm of these trips by
creating a co-curricular health law-focused service trip that would provide a
structured opportunity for health law students to practice law in their future
field of expertise. We also hoped to give health law students an opportunity to
learn about the health-related legal issues of individuals in low-resourced
communities as part of UM Carey Law's ongoing mission to meet the "third
apprenticeship" of legal education identified by the Carnegie Foundation as the
place where knowledge, skills, and the social-ethical dimensions of lawyering
come together to help students bridge the gap from law school to practice.

   Practically speaking, however, although the goals of service learning,
clinical education, and pro bono work clearly overlap in places, service
learning is different for a number of reasons. Service learning generally takes
place outside of the law school (sometimes far enough away that it requires
students to live together off site); lasts for a period of time shorter than a
semester; is the students' only activity while engaged in the experience; and is
often student-initiated. Unlike clinical education or pro bono work, service
learning is often an "immersion" experience.  n8 There are many definitions of
service learning, but most emphasize a learning experience that includes
meaningful community service with instruction and reflection. These definitions
offer substantial latitude, resulting in a wide variety of experiential learning
activities being labeled as "service learning."  n9 Among these are internships
with community-service organizations, class projects conducted with community-
service agencies, and consciousness-raising volunteerism. The benefit of service
learning does not accrue simply to the student; service learning can provide
tremendous economic benefits to non-profit organizations, supplementing or
complementing the work of a paid staff and helping organizations to hold down
costs.  n10

   Historians trace the emergence of service learning to the
government-sponsored programs of the 1960s such as VISTA and Peace Corps.  n11
Service learning is now a widely used educational tool throughout the American
educational system from kindergarten through graduate education. The
incorporation of service learning into the education process has grown at an
astounding rate since the early 1990s.  n12 Service learning programs have
become commonplace in American colleges and universities. While definitive
statistics are not available, over 900 two- and four-year colleges and
universities are members of Campus Compact,  n13 a national organization that
promotes community- and service-learning initiatives.  n14 Several prominent
private and governmental organizations promote service learning through grants,
education, and opportunity databases including Learn and Serve America's
National Service-Learning Clearinghouse, the National Service-Learning
Partnership, and the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Partnership Foundation.

   The wide variety of service-learning activities has made the assessment of
their effectiveness problematic.  n15 However, those who have studied the
[*403]  benefits of service learning have concluded that service learning
produces beneficial consequences for college students (no empirical work has
been conducted with law students). These benefits include increased grade point
averages, retention, degree completion, graduate degree aspiration, civic
responsibility, and life skills (interpersonal, leadership ability, social
self-confidence, critical thinking, and conflict resolution skills, and
understanding national and community problems).  n16 In addition, service
learning has a positive impact on the civic responsibility of students,
including serving the community, helping others in difficulty, cleaning up the
environment, influencing social values, and influencing the political structure.
n17 Finally, other research has noted the positive effects of service learning
on other constituents, including the college or university, faculty, and
sponsoring agencies involved in service-learning activities.  n18

   As noted earlier, many law schools have adopted creative approaches for
adding "third apprenticeship" opportunities to their curricula. Relevant to this
essay, some law school faculty are actively incorporating service
learning-concepts into their teaching. For example, faculty at the University of
the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law created a doctrinal
course with an experiential learning component based on the service-learning
model. The course was originally designed to address the aftermath of Hurricane
Katrina but has evolved to encompass other man-made and natural disasters. In a
paper describing the history of the course and its methodology, the faculty who
created it argue that "service-learning provides the most effective vehicle for
the third apprenticeship [as it] brings together the values of the baby boomer
generation with the concerns of the Millennial generation."  n19 Another
professor at Gonzaga University School of Law who incorporated a service
learning component into her Women and the Law course by requiring students to
spend 20-25 hours working at social service agencies with low-income women,
praised her "experiment" as a success for "heightening student awareness of
women's issues [and] promoting a longer-term commitment to public service work."
n20 A professor at Saint Louis University School of Law created a service
-learning component for her Disability Law course, which involved getting the
city to cut sidewalk curbs near the law school for improved access by disabled
people, and she observed that doing the project "benefitted me in many of the
same ways it did my students."  n21

   If service learning is relatively rare in the law school context, then a
health law service-learning opportunity may be rarer still. At UM Carey Law, we
have a strong health law program with a growing number of students graduating
each year with the Certificate in Health Law. Like other law schools, we have a
number of clinics that tackle health law-related topics, and the credits earned
from these clinics count toward the Certificate in Health Law. We also have a
robust health law externship program that includes a required practice-skills
course called the Health Law Workshop. Both the clinical offerings and
externship program offer rich opportunities for students to gain experience
practicing health law and learning about the social and ethical dimensions of
health law practice. We saw an opportunity, however, to add to these offerings a
co-curricular immersion experience for health law students to enhance doctrinal
classroom education while being exposed to social justice issues that surround
access to health care and health care policy. Over an eight-month planning
period, we were able to find a willing collaborating partner who worked with us
to create a "doable" health law project that gave 10 students the chance to
conduct legal research, interview stakeholders on the ground, present their
findings, and draft a report that served as a valuable resource to our
collaborating partner.

How-To Guide
As the Managing Director of the L&HCP, I took the lead in organizing these
trips. The planning process has been similar for each trip and has worked well
enough for us to consider it a proven model for a successful trip and one that
we hope other health law faculty will consider adopting. I will describe the
first project in 2010 in detail from conception through execution to evaluation
of the project, and then provide a brief description of the 2011 and 2012 trips
and conclusions we have drawn from all three projects.

Logistical Framework
By 2010, the Maryland Law Service Corps (MLSC) at UM Carey Law had already sent
student teams to the Gulf Coast during the last week of winter break for four
successive years to help address legal issues that arose in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina.  n22 These trips were (and still are) organized by students
who do not receive academic credit for their participation. During the first
trip in 2006, students worked in the Public Defender's Office in New Orleans. To
accommodate the growing number of students who wanted to participate annually,
MLSC moved from providing a single placement to offering several different
"trips" to the Gulf Coast region that students can choose from. In addition to
the criminal law trip -- which has now expanded beyond the Office of the Public
Defender to include other organizations that represent indigent criminal
defendants -- MLSC has added a civil law trip  n23 and a rebuilding trip.  n24
It was the addition of these new trips that sparked in us the idea of adding a
health law trip to MLSC's offerings.  [*404]  We considered other sites --
including sites in Baltimore and Nicaragua -- but believed that the existing
MLSC framework was a good vehicle to support the trip, fundraise, and select
students.

   Under the MLSC framework, two students are selected to lead each trip. Save
for the first year, they are chosen from the group of students who went on the
specific trip the previous year. This system has worked well because the team
leaders have developed relationships with collaborating attorneys and
stakeholders the previous year. In terms of faculty participation, the learning
component of the health law trip requires active faculty participation in the
planning and pre-departure research stages of the trip. In terms of the week on
site, my full participation was essential during the first year to ensure that
things went smoothly and to observe the project first hand. I was on site for
the last three days of the second trip and in telephone contact for the most
recent trip. With strong team leaders, faculty participation on site should only
be necessary for the first trip, although it is useful to be available by
telephone during the week and to check in periodically. I have found that
providing this degree of independence to the students has promoted leadership
skills and self-directed learning in a way that is observable later in the
students' law school careers.

Finding a Collaborating Partner
Once we decided to add a health law project to the MLSC trips to the Gulf Coast,
we set about finding a collaborating partner. We reached out to the Mississippi
Center for Justice (MCJ), a nationally recognized leader in nonprofit public
interest law. MCJ has a long history of working with law students from different
law schools to support the organization's mission and expose students to legal
work that focuses on racial and economic justice through advocacy for systemic
change. UM Carey Law already had ties to the organization because MCJ had served
as the local collaborator for MLSC's civil law trip. As luck would have it, MCJ
has a health law practice group in Jackson. I say "luck" because it is quite
unusual to find a non-profit law firm that groups attorneys under a "health law"
rubric, even if they are working on matters that would be considered health law,
e.g., Medicaid and SSA disability cases, HIV discrimination work, and public
health matters. When searching for a collaborating partner, there are many
options beyond groups that have a specific health law practice.

   In my initial conversation with attorneys at MCJ, I offered them 10 eager
health law students for one week of service under my supervision. It did not
take much salesmanship to interest MCJ attorneys in the project given their
experience hosting law student groups in the past. When approaching an
organization that does not have this experience, it would be useful to have
concrete suggestions as to what a group of students can accomplish in a week's
time; whether students will conduct research before they leave; the knowledge
base of the students based on which year of law school they are in and the
courses they have taken; and the amount of supervision and work faculty members
will provide to the project.

   In terms of the duties of the collaborating partner, their dedication to the
success of the project is key, and this involves their willingness to commit
time to the project both before and during the time on site. It is hard to
define what time and effort commitment is necessary, but at a minimum, the
attorney(s) must be willing to devote enough time to identify and develop the
project before the trip and have time to meet with the students when they arrive
to welcome them and answer questions about the project. They must also be
available during the week to answer questions and, at the end of the week, to
hear the students' findings and provide feedback. MCJ attorneys generously gave
their time to our students, including one attorney, Linda Rigsby, Health Law
Director, who devoted a full week to our team for each of the three trips as a
subject matter expert, advisor, and dedicated tour guide. While this degree of
participation in the trip is not necessary for a successful trip, Linda's
engagement was a critical factor in the pleasure our students took from the
trips.

Identifying and Framing the Project
Identifying and framing a project that is valuable to both the collaborating
partner and the students was (and every subsequent year, is) the most difficult
part of planning these projects. Every year this task requires multiple
conference calls, legal and policy research, and management of student and
collaborator expectations. Although the health law trip is technically run by
MLSC students with faculty in an advisory role, a faculty member should be
involved in initial project discussions. Faculty members -- more than students
or collaborators -- are in the best position to determine what can be expected
of students in a specific timeframe. Agreeing on the contours of a project
before it begins is essential to avoid misunderstandings and disappointed
expectations.

   My early conversations with MCJ involved identifying health-related issues
that the attorneys were working on but also eliminating issues that were
particularly time sensitive and those that required skills beyond the students'
abilities. We therefore honed in on long-term projects that MCJ attorneys were
interested in pursuing. I framed the question by asking: Are there any issues
that interest you but you haven't had time to research or develop? Over the last
three years, this has proven to be  [*405]  a valuable formula for identifying
appropriate projects.

   In my experience, a good project has the following attributes:


     . it is one that the students have the legal skill to accomplish;

     . it can be completed in one week;

     . if pre-departure research is required, students are willing to do
     pre-departure research for the project over winter break;

     . the project includes the opportunity to meet with local
     stakeholders;

     . it is comprised of separable components that can be divided among
     team members so that they can work in smaller groups;

     . the subject matter of the project is interesting (of course this is
     subjective, but a compelling project is likely to energize the student
     team in a way that enhances the overall success of the trip);

     . there are opportunities during execution of the project to use the
     students' non-legal skills (such as videography, blogging, and
     computer graphics); and

     . the collaborating partners or local stakeholders will allow the
     students to present their work at the end of the week.


The project we chose in 2010 focused on hospital charity policies and debt
collection practices. In 2009, MCJ, in collaboration with the Mississippi
Coalition for Citizens with Disabilities, created the Hospital Accountability
Project to document hospital charity care and debt collection practices in
Mississippi. MCJ was exploring the issue after hearing reports that uninsured
individuals were being treated at hospitals, not offered any form of discounted
payment (charity care), and subsequently made the subject of abusive debt
collection practices on the part of the hospital or their collection agents. MCJ
wanted to pursue the issue but first wanted to know how other states were
approaching it and what was happening at the national level in terms of federal
policies or development of best practices.

   This long-term project was perfect for students as the subject matter was
relatively straightforward, had a strong social justice component, and was
critical to MCJ's advocacy agenda. At the same time, Linda Rigsby and other MCJ
attorneys were beginning to turn their sights to the vast unmet need for legal
services in the Delta region of Mississippi. They were in the process of
finalizing a survey that they hoped to administer in the Delta region to
identify legal concerns of Delta residents particularly in the area of access to
health care. MCJ had identified a strong connection between lack of health
insurance and the resultant negative consequences of burdensome hospital debt.
We agreed that students would conduct research on hospital charity care and debt
collection practices and help administer surveys in the Delta.

   Spending time in the Delta has become a highlight of the trip and an
experience that future student leaders of the health law trip will have trouble
giving up, even if a project does not naturally emerge in the Delta. In their
reflections, the students speak of the window that the Delta has given them into
the incredible bravery and warmth of individuals confronted by deep-rooted
poverty, of the systemic factors that make emerging from poverty difficult to
solve, and the intense satisfaction the students feel providing assistance to
people in need.

Work Plan
Once the project was identified, I worked with MCJ to develop a work plan and
schedule (both for pre-departure research and for the week in Mississippi). We
determined the scope and extent of the legal research, and I asked for student
volunteers. Four students were willing to conduct pre-departure research.  n25 I
divided the work into four sections: (1) Mississippi law relating to hospital
charity care; (2) federal law relating to hospital charity care and any best
practices in the area; (3) Mississippi law relating to debt collection
practices; and (4) federal law relating to debt collection practices and any
best practices in the area. The students and I met several times before leaving
and conducted conference calls over winter break to discuss the progress of
their research.

   By the time we left for Mississippi, their research had been written into
memo form and all that remained was to interview individuals we identified in
Mississippi as having expertise in the area (e.g., an executive with the
Mississippi Hospital Association). We created a list of people the students
needed to meet with during their trip who had expertise or experience in charity
care and debt collection. MCJ was able to mine their contacts so that we could
arrange meetings with individuals in the state legislature and the Department of
Health, health care providers, local  [*406]  attorneys, advocacy organizations,
and members of the faith community. We found people very willing to meet with
the students, although it was often hard to arrange a meeting until very close
to our departure date which hindered our planning efforts.

   We developed a schedule for the week that remains the model we use to plan
all future trips. The students arrived in Mississippi on Sunday. On Monday
morning, MCJ attorneys provided them with an orientation. The most valuable part
of the orientation was a training session on how to administer the MCJ survey
from a technical and culturally sensitive point of view. From Monday afternoon
to Wednesday evening, the students met with stakeholders. Because all three of
the trips have focused on the Delta region of Mississippi, we have worked in
both Jackson and the Delta and spent the night in the Delta to decrease travel
time. The students conducted surveys in locations in the Delta suggested by MCJ
including a soup kitchen, Mississippi Valley State University, and a community
center.

   Spending time in the Delta has become a highlight of the trip and an
experience that future student leaders of the health law trip will have trouble
giving up, even if a project does not naturally emerge in the Delta. In their
reflections, the students speak of the window that the Delta has given them into
the incredible bravery and warmth of individuals confronted by deep-rooted
poverty, of the systemic factors that make emerging from poverty difficult to
solve, and the intense satisfaction the students feel providing assistance to
people in need. While students could have this experience in Jackson (and many
other places), I have found that the rural communities of the Delta provide an
intense and moving experience for students that speaks for itself in the
affection the students have developed for the region. This feeling on the part
of our students may reflect the fact the UM Carey Law is located on an urban
campus and may not be as compelling for students in differently-situated law
schools. I simply note that, as in the world of real estate, "location,
location, location" seems to matter a great deal to the value of the experience
for the students.

   On Thursday, the students worked as a group at a public library in Jackson
that had internet access to write a report on their findings (incorporating
pre-departure research, interview data, and survey findings) and prepared for
the presentation on Friday. These two final days require strong student leaders
or a faculty member on site to provide direction to the students. Many of the
students who participate in the health law trip are first-year students with
only one semester of legal writing and research under their belts. It is
therefore very important to have strong leaders who can help students commit
their findings to paper, develop legal and policy recommendations, and edit
drafts. The leaders must also be able to divide work among students and help
them meet deadlines.

   On the final day of the trip, MCJ organized a meeting in their conference
room for students to present their findings to MCJ attorneys, a handful of
health policymakers, and State Representative John Hines, Sr., who represents
the Delta region in the Mississippi legislature and serves on the House
Committee on Public Health and Human Services. This Friday presentation has
proven to be a valuable opportunity for students to speak publically and engage
in legal and policy discussions with health law and policy makers. With a group
of ten students, I have found it most convenient to divide the students into
topic teams, with one spokesperson who presents the findings and recommendations
and with all members of the team available for questions.

   At the presentation, the students presented their findings regarding charity
care and debt collection. They summarized the laws in the 12 states that have
passed legislation addressing the issue and the advisory guidelines for states
and hospitals developed by state hospital associations and national
organizations, such as Community Catalyst, Families USA, the American Hospital
Association, and the Healthcare Financial Management Association. In addition to
the regulatory approach, the students discussed lawsuits that have been filed
(unsuccessfully) by or on behalf of patients in various states against hospitals
and hospital associations seeking relief from abusive debt collection practices.
The students also presented their findings of the 60 surveys they conducted.

   A final, but important, scheduling note is the importance of including
sightseeing and "down time" into the week. MCJ arranged for us to tour one of
the Delta's most impressive cultural gems: the B.B. King Museum. The students
also had a tour of the state capitol building and dined on southern cuisine in
the Delta and Jackson.

Evaluation and Feedback
We have not conducted a formal evaluation of the health law trip either from the
perspective of student growth or the value of the work the students have
conducted for MCJ. However, we have had informal feedback on both fronts.
Students have enjoyed the trip greatly, and the trip has been oversubscribed all
three years with some interested students having to go on other trips because
they did not get into the health law trip. Despite the fact that the students do
not receive academic credit and yet are required to do a fair amount of research
and writing before and during the trip, this does not seem to be a disincentive
to participate. In fact, students have enjoyed the opportunity to work alongside
MCJ attorneys and present their findings in a professional manner at a
round-table meeting. As one student noted  [*407]  in an L&HCP newsletter story
about the trip, "[w]e had a great sense of accomplishment because the hard work
we did prior to our week in the Delta and during our time there was genuinely
appreciated by everyone at MCJ." Below are other student comments about the
trip:


     "The opportunity to meet fascinating people, grapple with complex
     legal and health issues, all while enjoying quintessential Southern
     food and culture, made the trip unforgettable."

     "You don't have to wait until after you finish school to help. Three
     years is a long time to wait but you can start giving back while you
     are still in school [as part of the health law trip]."

     "We left Mississippi with a sense of accomplishment and the experience
     was truly rewarding both educationally and culturally."

   Feedback from MCJ has been very positive as well. Part of MCJ's mission is to
conduct advocacy by engaging elected officials and community leaders in a number
of policy campaigns, many of which are health related. The report that the
students wrote on hospital charity care and debt collection was used by MCJ to
advocate for improved charity care policies, especially on the part of nonprofit
hospitals that often fail to meet their community-service mandates, and better
debt regulation policies. MCJ has expressed its wish that we continue to send
teams of health law students in the future.

2011 Trip: A Report on the Legal Concerns of Individuals with HIV/AIDS in the
Delta
As I mentioned earlier, in 2010, MCJ was planning to increase its work in the
Delta region, particularly with regard to the legal needs of individuals with
HIV/AIDS. In 2011, MCJ asked the UM Carey Law team to interview individuals with
HIV/AIDS, health care providers, community advocates, lawyers, and faith leaders
in the Delta about the legal concerns of individuals with HIV/AIDS and their
access to legal services. In the first three days of the project, the student
team met with a variety of stakeholders in Jackson and in towns throughout the
Delta. They noted a number of common themes including privacy violations,
workplace and housing discrimination, lack of access to health care services,
pervasive stigma, and fear of being ostracized from the community.

   Back in Jackson, the students completed their written report and presented
their findings to MCJ staff and Representative John Hines Sr. (mentioned above).
He has sponsored legislation on HIV/AIDS prevention including comprehensive sex
education reform efforts. Representative Hines said he would use the information
from the student report to begin addressing the needs of the Mississippi
HIV/AIDS community through legislative action.

2012 Trip: Know-Your-Rights Pamphlets on HIV/AIDS and the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act
During the 2012 trip, the students prepared "know-your-rights" pamphlets in two
subject areas. This proved to be an achievable and worthwhile project for the
students. Building on the work of the prior trip, MCJ asked half of the students
to prepare "know your rights" pamphlets for individuals with HIV/AIDS. Prior to
leaving, the students studied the 2011 student trip report and other sources to
get a general idea of HIV/AIDS legal issues and resources to include in the
pamphlets. They also identified a student with graphic design skills in the
group who created a template for the pamphlets prior to leaving. The students
prepared three pamphlets relating to the following issues: housing
discrimination, employment discrimination, and access to health care. One of the
biggest struggles for the students was making the language in the brochures
accessible.

   MCJ also asked the students to prepare a pamphlet regarding the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and what benefits were already
available under the law and what benefits may be available in the future. The
students conducted street interviews to determine how familiar Mississippians
were with PPACA and the best method of dispensing information about PPACA to the
general public. They also researched the resources available to Mississippians
who have little or no access to health care. Based on their interviews, the
PPACA group created a fact sheet and three separate pamphlets: one concerning
general PPACA information, one with information about children's rights under
the PPACA, and one about care for individuals with preexisting conditions. The
pamphlets were designed for general distribution and as a tool that MCJ can
modify to fit the audiences they hope to reach. At the final presentation,
attendees provided feedback on the pamphlets.

Conclusion
Our experience creating and sustaining a health law service trip has been
overwhelmingly positive. We are providing students with an opportunity to
develop legal skills in their chosen field of study, and we are exposing them to
the social justice consequences of health policy decisions made at the state and
federal level. Through both luck and perseverance, we have developed a framework
that is flexible enough to accommodate new projects each year but structured
enough to ensure that the goals of the trip are met no matter what the project
is. One unexpected outcome of the trip has been the impact it has had on the
body of  [*408]  health law students at the law school. The trip has almost
become a rite of passage for first-year health law students and, because of the
peer bonding that occurs in any immersion experience, has created a stronger
sense of family among health law students. The ripples of this can be felt
throughout the L&HCP -- indeed their enthusiasm is contagious.

     Each law school is encouraged to be creative in developing substantial

     bono opportunities should at a minimum involve the rendering of
     meaningful law-related service to persons of limited means or to

     most existing law school pro bono programs include only activities for
     which students do not receive academic credit, Standard 302(b)(2) does
     not preclude the inclusion of credit-granting activities within a law

the student teams and conducts fund-raising to support the teams. MLSC's goal is
to raise enough funds to pay for the students' airfare, car rental,
accommodation, and a daily per diem for each student. To date, this lofty goal
has not been reached, but the funds that are raised are used to offset the cost
of the trip for each participant and therefore the cost of the trip has been
relatively low. The students spend the last week of winter break - usually
Saturday to Saturday - on site in the Gulf Coast. Students do not receive credit

Humanity to build houses for individuals in need. This trip does not include a
legal component.




n25  In the course of the three trips, we have not made a formal decision as to
whether students should be required to work on project matters before they
leave. As I note above, I solicited volunteers the first year. In the second
year, the team leaders were the only students to conduct research before the
trip, and in the third year, the team leaders required all students to help with
the project before the trip. I think any model is acceptable as long as the
expectations are clear and conveyed in advance.

Delta Docs program at risk in federal budget

BYLINE: Michaela Gibson Morris, Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 649 words


March 22--TUPELO -- If the Delta Regional Authority is defunded, Mississippi
could lose access to an effective program that helps place doctors in
underserved rural communities.

Like the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Clarksdale-based authority that
covers 252 counties and parishes in eight states was not funded in the
preliminary budget submitted by President Donald Trump.

The authority oversees the Delta Doctors program that has placed 530 U.S.
trained, foreign-born physicians in rural communities in eight states --
Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and
Tennessee since 2004. Of the 87 placed in 2016, 22 came to Mississippi.

"The DRA has really been very proactive," said Barry Walker, a Tupelo
immigration attorney who has worked through the program to help clinics and
hospitals around the state. "They are an excellent program for bringing doctors
to the places that need them most."

Of Mississippi's 82 counties, 76 are considered health professional shortage
areas. The Delta Regional Authority covers 56 counties in Mississippi. The Delta
Doctors program can also work with clinics and hospitals in adjacent counties.

"It covers almost the entire state," said Walker, including Tupelo, Meridian and
Hattiesburg.

Mississippi's senators noted the federal budgeting process is just beginning and
the Delta Regional Authority has a strong reputation.

"Our state makes good use of Delta Regional Authority funds by supporting roads
and bridges to attract industry and improving the health of Mississippians,"
said Sen. Roger Wicker in a statement. "I have no doubt that people in
neighboring states would agree to the importance of the agency in their own
communities."

How it works

When foreign-born doctors get permission to complete medical training at U.S.
residency and fellowship programs, they have to prove the are competent in
English and clinical skills, Walker said. They enter under a J-1 visa that
requires them to return home for at least two years after completing training
unless they get a waiver.

Typically, hospital and clinic recruiters identify candidates during their final
year of training. They contact immigration attorneys like Walker to assist in
the waiver process. If the position is in a medically underserved area that
falls inside the Delta Doctors guidelines, the program has been very effective.

As part of the J-1 waiver program, they agree to practice in a medically
underserved area for at least three years, Walker said. Many stay beyond the
required period.

The Delta Doctors program has received 556 applications and been able to place
530 in rural communities in the region, according to the agency. It has already
received 26 applications for 2017.

The Delta Docs program isn't the only J-1 waiver program available. Each state
can grant up to 30 waivers a year. However, the Delta Doctors program has
historically been extremely proactive in meeting the needs of the communities it
serves, Walker said.

In Congress

The work of the Delta Regional Authority focuses on economic, infrastructure and
community development. For fiscal year 2016, the agency received $25 million in
federal funds. The Senate and House are currently still negotiating Fiscal Year
2017 funding, but three Senate committees have recommended funding for Delta
Regional Authority.

"The president's budget recommendation is only the first step in the budget and
appropriations process," Sen. Thad Cochran said in a statement. "From here, the
House and Senate will carefully consider the benefits of the Delta Regional
Authority for residents of Mississippi and other states before crafting final
legislative proposals."

Antioch chamber honors top citizens, businesses at annual gala

ANTIOCH -- Businesses here took a bow Friday along with nonprofits, civic-minded
teens and others who have given of themselves to make Antioch a better place to
live.

Nearly 200 people turned out for Antioch Chamber of Commerce's annual gala
affair where initiative, volunteerism and generosity received standing ovations
during the awards ceremony.

Two people were named Citizen of the Year, longtime resident Tom Menasco,
accepting the title for lifetime achievement, and painting contractor Tom
Hartrick for having the greatest impact on the city last year.

Menasco was one of the founders of Antioch Sports Legends, a portion of Antioch
Historical Society's museum that has been paying tribute to outstanding local
athletes since fall 2007.

The former city employee has spent nearly all his life in Antioch, and over the
past 48 years Menasco has volunteered for well over a dozen organizations from
the Salvation Army Corps and Antioch Committee on Aging to the Antioch Youth
Sports Complex and Kaiser Permanente's medical center.

Hartrick, a member of Rotary Club of the Delta, organized the painting of
Antioch's senior center's interior as well as the outside of The Delta Learning
Center. He also has helped build homes in Mexico, participates in the city's
regular trash cleanups, distribute dictionaries to local third-graders and
provide backpacks for foster children.

"These citizens have dedicated their lives to this community -- they are both
winners," said Sean Wright, Antioch chamber of commerce's chief executive
officer.

Also honored was Paula's Family Florist as Small Business of the Year and The
Dow Chemical Company for its contributions as a business with 201 manufacturing
sites in 35 countries.

The florist shop donates to the "Every 15 Minutes" campaign that discourages
high school students from drinking and driving, donates flowers for events, and
hosts field trips where children create bud vases to take home.

Dow Chemical has earned national recognition for restoring and preserving the
wetlands that it bought to serve as a buffer zone for its nearby plant, an area
that doubles as an outdoors lab for science students. The company also helps
meet people's needs by supporting Habitat for Humanity's construction of
low-income housing.

Antioch High School student Eboni Agee accepted kudos along with a $1,000
scholarship as Youth of the Year for community service that has included
knitting hats and scarves for hospitalized infants, veterans and the homeless.

She also volunteers at an assisted living facility and has helped out at an
annual fitness fair that raises funds for projects benefiting local youth,
seniors, service clubs and libraries.

Agee, who is in the top 1 percent of her class, plans to pursue a career as a
chemical engineer.

And the nonprofit Opportunity Junction won top billing for providing the job
training that has enabled thousands of low-income residents around the county
over the past 15 years to become self-sufficient.

During the ceremony Antioch Mayor Wade Harper also swore in the chamber's new
15-member board of directors.

Antioch chamber honors top citizens, businesses at annual gala

ANTIOCH -- Businesses here took a bow Friday along with nonprofits, civic-minded
teens and others who have given of themselves to make Antioch a better place to
live.

Nearly 200 people turned out for Antioch Chamber of Commerce's annual gala
affair where initiative, volunteerism and generosity received standing ovations
during the awards ceremony.

Two people were named Citizen of the Year, longtime resident Tom Menasco,
accepting the title for lifetime achievement, and painting contractor Tom
Hartrick for having the greatest impact on the city last year.

Menasco was one of the founders of Antioch Sports Legends, a portion of Antioch
Historical Society's museum that has been paying tribute to outstanding local
athletes since fall 2007.

The former city employee has spent nearly all his life in Antioch, and over the
past 48 years Menasco has volunteered for well over a dozen organizations from
the Salvation Army Corps and Antioch Committee on Aging to the Antioch Youth
Sports Complex and Kaiser Permanente's medical center.

Hartrick, a member of Rotary Club of the Delta, organized the painting of
Antioch's senior center's interior as well as the outside of The Delta Learning
Center. He also has helped build homes in Mexico, participates in the city's
regular trash cleanups, distribute dictionaries to local third-graders and
provide backpacks for foster children.

"These citizens have dedicated their lives to this community -- they are both
winners," said Sean Wright, Antioch chamber of commerce's chief executive
officer.

Also honored was Paula's Family Florist as Small Business of the Year and The
Dow Chemical Company for its contributions as a business with 201 manufacturing
sites in 35 countries.

The florist shop donates to the "Every 15 Minutes" campaign that discourages
high school students from drinking and driving, donates flowers for events, and
hosts field trips where children create bud vases to take home.

Dow Chemical has earned national recognition for restoring and preserving the
wetlands that it bought to serve as a buffer zone for its nearby plant, an area
that doubles as an outdoors lab for science students. The company also helps
meet people's needs by supporting Habitat for Humanity's construction of

Jabberwock Cotillion to feature gospel, 'Idol' contest

BYLINE: By YVETTE KIMM yvette.kimm@heraldtribune.com

In 1925, a Delta Sigma Theta Sorority member in Boston was so inspired by the
work of Lewis Carroll that she named a gala showcasing local talent after one of
his creations.

That event was the Jabberwock Cotillion, to raise money for college
scholarships.

Today, Jabberwock Cotillions are held across the country, including one tonight
at Southeast High School in Bradenton.

Six girls will vie for titles at the event, which has the theme of "A
Celebration of Gospel: The Old and New."

"We hope to raise $25,000 this year for our scholarships," said Carolyn Major
Harper, the sorority's Bradenton-Sarasota chapter Jabberwock contestant
chairwoman.

Throughout the years, the chapter has handed out hundreds of scholarships to
help local black students.

The Jabberwock contestants have been working with teams of sorority members to
raise scholarship money. The top fundraisers will win crowns and titles.

Vying for Little Miss Jabberwock are Duraia Jan'e Cox-Gibson and Marquia Walker.

Junior Miss Jabberwock contestants are Raven Carnegie and Tansha Mathews.

Andrea Booker and Tameka B. Clayton-Hunter are the Miss Jabberwock contestants.

"Participating in Jabberwock also provides a wonderful opportunity for the
girls," Harper said.

The girls are introduced to the community and enhance their social skills
through several activities, such as a "meet-and-greet" social, visits to area
churches and a formal dinner.

They also visit the Family Heritage House Museum at Manatee Community College
for their cultural education activity.

"These are the things that help the girls become well-rounded young ladies,"
Harper said.

Jabberwock will include something new this year, the Delta Idol Contest, based
on the popular "American Idol" TV show. Students will compete for prizes.

Because the sorority is expecting a large crowd, Delta Idol is the perfect venue
for aspiring entertainers, sorority member Dawnyelle N. Singleton said.

Also appearing at the event will be the Booker High School Gospel Chorus.

"Adding gospel music is also something new for us," Singleton said. "We really
look forward to hearing the Booker Gospel Chorus. They are a wonderful choir."

Six named to SMH Black History Hall of Fame

There are nearly 120 years of combined service to Sarasota Memorial Health Care
System among the six employees inducted Monday into the company's Black History
Hall of Fame.

A ceremony recognizing the much respected and much admired honorees -- and
featuring a gospel choir, gospel rap group and poetry readings -- marked the
conclusion of the month-long Black History Month celebration at the hospital.

The new inductees were:

* Diane Heggs, a health unit coordinator in the Meckler Admission Center and
17-year employee.

* Carletha Hubbard, a pharmacy technician and an employee for nearly three
decades.

* Brenda Morris, a nurse by profession who now works as a utilization case
manager at Bayside Center for Behavioral Health, and 12-year employee. She helps
patients with insurance issues and makes sure they have the resources when
released to support their needs.

* Cathy White, a rehabilitation technician and CNA for acute rehab, and an
employee for nearly two decades.

* Joseph L. Franklin of central storage and supply chain management and 28-year
employee.

* Victor Rowe, environmental services technician for the operating room and a
13-year employee.

Employees who exemplify leadership, excellence, a positive self image and
dedicated service to others and their community are nominated by co-workers and
selected by a committee.

This was the fourth annual Hall of Fame ceremony.

Habitat for Humanity plans 'Hammers & Hope' celebration

Habitat for Humanity Sarasota is planning its first "Hammers & Hope" gala event,
with all proceeds supporting the building of homes for deserving, low-income
families.

The theme is "Twenty Years of Building Hope, One Unforgettable Night."

The dinner and auction will be held at the historic Sarasota Municipal
Auditorium on March 22 at 6 p.m.

Guests will hear about Habitat's housing initiatives, view models of homes in
future Habitat neighborhoods and feel the rewards of giving a hand up rather
than a hand out.

Habitat board member Laurin Ripley is chairing the event, which will include
cocktails and dinner catered by Michael's on East.

Tickets are $150 a person. They can be purchased by calling 487-5510.

Silver Hammer Patrons and table sponsors will be invited to a party at the home
of Board Chairman Brock Leach and his wife, Julie.

For more information or to become a sponsor, call Habitat's director of
development, Deborah Rohaty, 365- 0700, Ext. 111.

Dunn was presented with 2014 Excellence in Public Health Award at the Fourth
Annual Distinguished Lecture and Induction Ceremony at UH M[#x101]noa.

The award recognizes medical students who show their dedication to public health
by making exceptional contributions to the community through [#x200b]U.S. health
[#x200b]initiatives, including[#x200b][#x200b] Healthy People 2020 and the
National Prevention Strategy. [#x200b]

The award was created by the the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) to
inspire medical students to commit themselves to public health and to become
leaders in the field.

Each year, every U.S. medical school is able to nominate one student who has
worked hard to increase awareness about health care and put that knowledge into
action.

This year, Dunn was recognized for his commitment to public health as the
volunteer coordinator of Hui Ola Pono, a public health student organization.  He
also co-founded Teen Health Camp Hawai`i, a program that has helped more than
500 disadvantaged high school students overcome academic struggles and seek
mentors in higher education in public health and medicine, and consider
health-focused careers.

"Along with Teresa Schiff (fourth-year medical student) and Eduardo Duquez
(JABSOM Alumni '13), I established Teen Health Camp Hawai`i in 2009 to inspire
local students to enter the field of health care and hopefully help combat our
state's terrifying shortage in health-care workers," said Dunn.  "Teen Health
Camp Hawai`i is a motivational career-oriented program targeted at
underrepresented middle and high school students in rural Hawai`i. This program
is designed to attract minority students to health-care careers through fun and
interactive workshops in health-care training, while also teaching students
about opportunities and options in higher education," said Dunn.

Dunn, who is the MD Class of 2016 President, earned his Master's in Public
Health (MPH) in Epidemiology at the UHM in 2011, and was inducted into the
Hawai`i Delta Omega Society that same year. Apart from receiving the 2014
Excellence in Public Health Award, Dunn was honored with the Koseki Award for
Excellence in Community Service during his MPH studies and the 2013 American
Heart Association Student Scholarship in Cardiovascular Disease for his research
efforts at the medical school.

Dunn counts among his mentors Public Health Studies Professor Alan Katz, whom he
worked closely with during his MPH studies.

Dr. Katz described some of Dunn's work in the nomination paper he transmitted to
the public health service.  "Mr. Dunn's final project for his MPH degree was an
ambitious survey of hospital and community-based health professionals in Hawai`i
on the topic of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections,"
Dr. Katz wrote.

"Working closely with his practicum advisor, the late Dr. Alan Tice, a professor
at our School of Medicine and an infectious disease specialist, he developed and
pilot tested a survey tool which addressed knowledge of the epidemiology of MRSA
and attitudes towards antibiotic resistance. He then distributed the survey on
line, analyzed and interpreted the findings, and published his findings in the
Hawai`i Journal of Medicine and Public Health," Katz said.

Dunn expressed his gratitude to Dr. Katz and to JABSOM's Dean. "I would not have
been able to receive this (Excellence in Public Health) award without the
support from the JABSOM faculty, specifically Dr. Katz and Dean
[#x200b]Jerris[#x200b] Hedges, who ultimately nominated me for this award," said
Dunn.

Stupak pushes back against claims grant bought his vote

BYLINE: By Susan Crabtree

SECTION: Pg. 3

LENGTH: 795 words


Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) shot down Republican claims that federal grant money
for airports in his district helped convince him to vote for healthcare reform.
Stupak denounced any supposed links between the grants and his healthcare vote
as a smear campaign from Republicans who are "grasping at straws" to discredit
Democrats who voted in favor of the bill.

"It is absurd to think I would change my vote for a tow truck and a fence to
keep deer from walking onto the runway of an airport in my district," Stupak
said in a statement. "I have long advocated for comprehensive healthcare reform
and voted in favor of the House healthcare reform bill - a fact that many
opponents of healthcare reform can't seem to acknowledge." The right-wing
blogosphere has seized on Stupak's Friday announcement that three airports in
his district received a total of $726,409 in grants as the possible reason
behind his last-minute yes vote. "Did Stupak compromise his supposed principled
stand against taxpayer funding of abortion in exchange for taxpayer dollars for
pet projects?" asks one posting on Deal Watch, the National Republican
Congressional Committee's latest blog. A Stupak press release dated Friday,
March 19 trumpeted the three separate grants. The release said the grants
include: $85,500 to the Alpena County Regional Airport to acquire friction
measuring equipment, "specifically a decelermeter and tow vehicle"; $179,209 for
Delta County Airport to install a 10-foot perimeter fence to enhance security
and "prevent wildlife from entering the airport"; and $461,700 for the Chippewa
County International Airport "to install lighted signs on Runway 16/34" and make
pavement repairs. The Airport Improvement Program, which has existed since the
early 1980s, awarded grants in 47 states this year. At least six of the
districts receiving the funds are represented by Republicans, including Minority
Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Conference Chairman Mike Pence (R-Ind.), whose
districts received $108,738 and $75,000, respectively, according to a Department
of Transportation spreadsheet listing the grants. Stupak has found himself under
attack from all sides after striking a deal on an executive order on abortion
that handed Democrats a victory on healthcare. Stupak, along with eight or nine
other Democrats, had been negotiating with the White House for months over
abortion language in the bill. He announced Sunday afternoon that he was
satisfied with a White House agreement to issue an executive order preventing
the healthcare bill from providing public funding for abortions. Stupak has
accepted an apology from Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas), who owned up to
shouting "baby killer" during Stupak's floor speech Sunday night. But on
Tuesday, Stupak said Neugebauer should offer an apology to the entire House for
the outburst. Neugebauer said the shout came in the heat of the emotional
healthcare debate and was directed at the agreement reached by the Democratic
leadership on the executive order, not at Stupak himself. "Randy did call and
apologize and he said it wasn't directed toward me personally," Stupak said
Tuesday during a CBS News webcast. "If that's the case, then it must have been
directed toward the rest of the members of the House, and I would hope that
Randy would just clear it up and take to the House of the floor [sic] and say,
'Look, I didn't mean to offend anyone, and if I did, I apologize.' " Stupak
said. "That's what he should do and that's what I would expect him to do." House
Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) also thinks Neugebauer needs to apologize
to the full House for disgracing the institution. The executive order contains
language from the Hyde Amendment, a provision from a previous version of the
healthcare bill that prohibits the federal funding of abortion. Outside groups
on both sides of the abortion divide have denounced the deal, with
anti-abortion-rights groups arguing that executive orders do not have the power
to trump statutory law and abortion-rights groups condemning the language they
had long opposed. Stupak has spent the last two days defending the deal, and did
so again Tuesday. "The fact is, the executive order from President Obama coupled
with the colloquy stating congressional intent to apply the Hyde provisions to
prevent public funding for abortions clearly applies to the new healthcare
reform legislation," he said in the statement. "When you apply the Hyde
provisions protecting the unborn and add to it the fact that 31 million
Americans will now have access to healthcare and millions more will not be
denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions, this is one of the most truly
pro-life pieces of legislation in modern times." Michael O'Brien contributed to

ABSTRACT

CALBUDGET

FULL TEXT

SACRAMENTO >> With years of budget woes fading in the rear view mirror and a few
billion extra dollars padding state coffers, Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled his first
draft of the next state budget Thursday morning - including the framework of a
new tax on managed health care plans that will prevent a cutoff of federal
funds.

Brown pitched a $122.6 billion general-fund budget plan that he says makes
significant increases in funding for education, health care and state
infrastructure.


His plan also bolstered the state's rainy-day fund and continuing to pay down
state debts and liabilities.

"This budget, relative to the budgets of the last decade and a half, is in good
shape," Brown told reporters at a news conference in the state Capitol.

The governor pitched a proposal for the new managed health care plan tax after
several months of negotiations with health insurers, some of whom had not been
taxed in this manner before and initially balked at the idea, two Capitol
sources close to the talks said. The tax structure California uses now must be
phased out by the end of the fiscal year because it doesn't comply with new
Obama administration rules that dictate how health care plans may be taxed by
the states.

Currently, the state taxes only plans that accept Medi-Cal patients and uses all
the money it collects to help finance the health insurance program for
low-income Californians, which now covers one-third of the state's residents
after it was greatly expanded under the Affordable Care Act. The new tax must
hit all plans whether they accept Medi-Cal patients or not. Brown last year
called a special session on health care funding and urged the Legislature to
tackle the problem, but lawmakers failed to act by the end of last year's
legislative session.

Medi-Cal expenses

Brown's proposal provides a net reduction in taxes paid by the private health
care industry, secures funding for general fund Medi-Cal expenses, and provides
an opportunity for targeted rate increases for developmental disability
services.

Brown said he wants this tax formula set within a month or so, but for now
"there's no deal - there are some ideas, understanding of a very complex way to
help California at no cost, and we are inviting people to help us accomplish
that."

The budget proposal Brown unveiled Thursday is his long-range plan. As the
state's revenue and spending picture becomes clearer, he'll develop a revised
plan to roll out in May. The Legislature will then have until June 15 - a
deadline set by the state constitution - to negotiate and pass the budget.

Brown's budget deposits another $2 billion into the state's rainy day fund,
boosting it to 65 percent of its constitutionally set target.

School spending

The budget plan boosts school spending per student to $10,591 in 2016-17 -an
increase of nearly $3,600 compared to 2011-12. Brown also proposes a $1.6
billion early education block grant that combines three existing programs to
promote local flexibility, focusing on disadvantaged students and improved
accountability.

The budget also includes the governor's transportation package, first outlined
last summer, to provide $36 billion over the next decade to improve upkeep of
the state's crumbling highways and roads, expand public transit and improve
trade routes. There's another $807 million - of which $500 million comes from
the general fund - for critical backlogged maintenance.

The environmental centerpiece of Brown's budget is his plan to spend $3.1
billion from fees collected on big polluters under the state's cap-and-trade
program to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Brown proposed spending $500 million of that money on his controversial
high-speed rail plan; another $500 million for low-carbon fuel programs, such as
rebates for people who buy electric cars, hybrid trucks and zero"'emission
trucks and buses; $400 million for urban rail programs, and $150 million to
remove and replace many of the 22 million trees across the Sierra and other
rural parts of California that have died during the drought.

Cap-and-trade fees

Other programs he proposed funding from cap-and-trade fees would boost renewable
energy, restore wetlands, and pay for energy efficiency and weatherization of
state buildings.

California's four-year drought also received attention. The governor unveiled a
plan to spend $323 million on drought relief. Among the priorities: spending $77
million for beefing up firefighting crews and equipment, $42 million for
building rock barriers in the Delta to limit encroachment of salinity into water
supplies, $30 million to fund rebates for people who buy water-efficient toilets
and appliances and $26 million to assist unemployed farmworkers with food aid
and other relief.

"The world is expensive, and drought and climate change are part of the future,"
Brown said, "so I wouldn't be surprised if those costs continue to rise."

Brown also proposed spending $100 million in bond funding to shore up Delta
levees and $60 million to pay down deferred maintenance at state parks, such as
repaving roads, fixing roofs and modernizing campgrounds.

The governor's plan reflects the increase of the state's minimum wage to $10 per
hour, effective Jan. 1. Some Democrats are already pushing for an increase to
$15 per hour.

Ballot measure

Asked whether he would support or oppose a ballot measure to that effect, Brown
replied that raising the minimum wage further "has to be done very carefully; it
has to be done over time" and take economic conditions into account.

The budget proposal provides $380 million for the second year of the state's
Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps the state's poorest working families, as
well the first cost-of-living increases since 2006 for aged, blind and disabled
Californians in the Supplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payment
program.

But despite all this budgetary largesse, Brown cautioned that too much more
permanent spending, combined with another recession, would be devastating - a
scenario that could plunge the state back into deficits ranging up to $43
billion within a few years.

"We've had 10 recessions since World War II - we know we'll get another
recession, but nobody ever plans for it," Brown said, noting that he instructed
his Finance Department to model projections for an average-sized recession in
the next few years.

promote local flexibility, focusing on disadvantaged students and improved
accountability.

The budget also includes the governor's transportation package, first outlined
last summer, to provide $36 billion over the next decade to improve upkeep of
the state's crumbling highways and roads, expand public transit and improve
trade routes. There's another $807 million - of which $500 million comes from
the general fund - for critical backlogged maintenance.

The environmental centerpiece of Brown's budget is his plan to spend $3.1
billion from fees collected on big polluters under the state's cap-and-trade
program to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Brown proposed spending $500 million of that money on his controversial
high-speed rail plan; another $500 million for low-carbon fuel programs, such as
rebates for people who buy electric cars, hybrid trucks and zero"'emission
trucks and buses; $400 million for urban rail programs, and $150 million to
remove and replace many of the 22 million trees across the Sierra and other
rural parts of California that have died during the drought.

Cap-and-trade fees

Other programs he proposed funding from cap-and-trade fees would boost renewable
energy, restore wetlands, and pay for energy efficiency and weatherization of
state buildings.

California's four-year drought also received attention. The governor unveiled a
plan to spend $323 million on drought relief. Among the priorities: spending $77
million for beefing up firefighting crews and equipment, $42 million for
building rock barriers in the Delta to limit encroachment of salinity into water
supplies, $30 million to fund rebates for people who buy water-efficient toilets
and appliances and $26 million to assist unemployed farmworkers with food aid
and other relief.

"The world is expensive, and drought and climate change are part of the future,"
Brown said, "so I wouldn't be surprised if those costs continue to rise."

Brown also proposed spending $100 million in bond funding to shore up Delta
levees and $60 million to pay down deferred maintenance at state parks, such as
repaving roads, fixing roofs and modernizing campgrounds.

The governor's plan reflects the increase of the state's minimum wage to $10 per
hour, effective Jan. 1. Some Democrats are already pushing for an increase to
$15 per hour.

Ballot measure

Asked whether he would support or oppose a ballot measure to that effect, Brown
replied that raising the minimum wage further "has to be done very carefully; it
has to be done over time" and take economic conditions into account.

The budget proposal provides $380 million for the second year of the state's
Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps the state's poorest working families, as
well the first cost-of-living increases since 2006 for aged, blind and disabled
Californians in the Supplemental Security Income/State Supplemental Payment
program.

But despite all this budgetary largesse, Brown cautioned that too much more
permanent spending, combined with another recession, would be devastating - a
scenario that could plunge the state back into deficits ranging up to $43
billion within a few years.

"We've had 10 recessions since World War II - we know we'll get another
recession, but nobody ever plans for it," Brown said, noting that he instructed
his Finance Department to model projections for an average-sized recession in
the next few years.

NATIONAL BRIEFING

SECTION: Financial; D02

LENGTH: 993 words


ECONOMY

U.S. retail sales were weaker than expected in April as soaring gasoline prices
forced consumers to cut back on spending in other areas. The Commerce Department
reported that total retail sales rose 0.5 percent, to $362.67 billion, in April
following a 0.6 percent advance, to $360.92 billion, in March. Virtually all of
last month's growth came at gasoline stations, where sales climbed 4.6 percent
to $36.14 billion. Excluding gasoline, retail sales rose only 0.1 percent in
April.

BANKRUPTCY

The Connecticut Bar Association and the National Association of Consumer
Bankruptcy Attorneys have sued the Department of Justice, challenging the
constitutionality of its interpretation of several provisions of the bankruptcy
law passed by Congress in 2005.

They say the Justice Department defines bankruptcy lawyers as "debt relief
agencies," an interpretation that would bar lawyers from recommending some
options to clients  --  such as advising prospective bankruptcy filers to buy a
car before filing so they could get to work to earn money to repay debt.
Prohibiting speech to a client violates the First Amendment's guarantee of free
speech and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, including the right
to advice from a lawyer, the suit says.

INSURANCE

Legislation that would give small businesses a cheaper option when providing
health insurance stalled in the Senate. Under the proposal endorsed by President
Bush, businesses could buy insurance through regional or national trade
associations. The insurance would be free of many state mandates and could make
it a cheaper alternative for businesses and for workers who have no insurance.

In a vote of 55 to 43, Democrats blocked a motion that would have limited
debate, citing Republicans' refusal to allow votes on amendments  --  such as
extending Monday's Medicare enrollment deadline  --  that they considered a
priority.

Democrats also said the bill stripped away a state's ability to determine which
health-care screenings and treatments insurers must cover. They said states that
have worked for such protections for years and that it would not be right for
lawmakers in Washington to take them away.

UnitedHealth Group admitted a "significant deficiency" in its handling of stock
options and said it may have to restate several years of earnings. The nation's
second-largest health insurer had maintained that it handled options granted to
chief executive William McGuire and other executives appropriately.

The company said in a regulatory filing that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is conducting an "informal inquiry" of its options-granting practices
and said it could lose tax deductions for options grants it previously thought
were deductible. If restatements are needed, UnitedHealth said, as much as $286
million could be sliced from its earnings for 2003, 2004, and 2005.

The Minnetonka, Minn., company has been under fire for weeks since the Wall
Street Journal reported that 11 executives received stock-option grants at the
lowest daily closing price of their respective quarters, giving them the maximum
opportunity for profit.

AIRLINES

Delta Air Lines, the largest U.S. carrier operating in bankruptcy protection,
said its first-quarter loss widened to $2.07 billion from $1.07 billion in the
comparable period a year earlier on costs from its restructuring.

The loss included a $1.4 billion reorganization charge and $310 million for
accounting adjustments. It was Delta's second-largest shortfall, behind a $2.2
billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2004. The 2004 loss included a $1.9
billion write-down of the value of its commuter-carrier units.

Traffic, or miles flown by paying passengers, fell 6.4 percent as Delta dropped
unprofitable flights to trim capacity by 8.6 percent. The airline has eliminated
about 10 percent of its fleet and has said it wants to reduce capacity 7 percent
this year.

LEGAL

Universal Music Group Recordings, the world's largest record company, agreed to
pay $12 million to settle a payola case that claimed the company provided
vacations, electronics and other bribes to increase radio play for its artists,
New York Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said. The bribes and gifts were used
to get airplay for songs that included records by Nick Lachey, Ashlee Simpson,
Brian McKnight, Big Tymers and Lindsay Lohan, Spitzer said.

The California-based company agreed to pay the cash to charity, with $100,000 to
cover the cost of the investigation, and to adopt reforms, Spitzer said.

AUTOMOTIVE

Dana, a troubled maker of light-truck axles, delayed filing its first-quarter
results, which are to show a loss on reorganization costs and tax changes. Dana
said the delay stems from of the Chapter 11 reorganization process. It filed for
bankruptcy protection March 3, plagued by internal delivery problems, rising
steel costs and a drop in demand after production cuts at General Motors and
Ford Motor. It posted losses in three of the previous five quarters.

Separately, Delphi said in a regulatory filing that it won't release
first-quarter results until after it has calculated last year's results  --
which were delayed by the company's filing for bankruptcy protection in October.
It didn't say when it would make the filings.

J.C. Penney said that its first-quarter profit rose 22 percent, to $210 million
from $172 million in the comparable period a year earlier, as holding overhead
costs below the rate of inflation helped the department store operator
supplement a modest revenue increase. Revenue rose 2.5 percent, to $4.22
billion.

Kohl's said its first-quarter earnings rose 34 percent, to $167.2 million from
$124.7 million, buoyed by strong sales of home goods and its own clothing
brands. Revenue at the discount department store operator grew to $3.18 billion
from $2.74 billion.

Alstom And Other Technology Companies Form Smart Cities Council

   May 29, 2013

   More than a dozen top technology firms have formed the Smart Cities Council
to provide cities with tools and best practices. Operating under the banner
'Livability, Workability, Sustainability', the council has gathered the firms in
areas such as smart energy, water and transportation. These firms, which make up
the council's Steering Committee, include Alstom, AT&T, Bechtel, Cisco,
Electricite de France, General Electric, IBM, Itron, Microsoft, National Grid,
Qualcomm, and S&C Electric.In addition to lead partners, the council's associate
partners include ABB, Alphinat, Grid2020, Invensys, MaxWest Environmental
Systems, Opower, and Zipcar, a division of Avis.Mayors and city leaders can tap
into this global hub to develop a comprehensive and collaborative roadmap for
their city, to gain advice on the most effective ways to move forward, and to
compare notes with like-minded leaders. Jesse Berst, Smart Cities Council's
founding chairman, said, "All over the world, rapid urbanization is putting
enormous stress on city resources and infrastructure. Cities are at a
crossroadsmany are nearing the point at which they could easily become
overwhelmed by issues related to crime, congestion, and public health and
safety. To prevent this, cities can use smart technologies to not just manage
problems, but to usher in a new era of prosperity and sustainability." A
â[#x20ac][#x2dc]smart city' uses digital technology to deliver better, more
efficient services to its citizens. It enables access to information via data
collected from devices and sensors that are embedded in roadways, energy and
water infrastructure, buildings and more. For example, smart power and water
grids improve efficiency and reliability, as well as provide customers with
detailed information to help them reduce their bills. For another example, a
smart transportation network optimizes multi-modal travel throughout the city
with real-time bus updates, taxi locations, and the ability to reserve parking
spots. Thousands of smart city projects are underway around the globe, but major
hurdles remain. Cities have significant questions and challenges with regard to
the four chief barriers of technology, financing, policy, and citizen
engagement. The council was formed to lower these barriers to adoption through
education, outreach, and tools for cities. One of the Smart Cities Council's
first initiatives is the development of the Readiness Guide, which will launch
as a beta version at the 81st Annual United States Conference of Mayors next
month. The Readiness Guide will be the first collaborative and comprehensive
vision of a smart city. It will provide city leaders with a conceptual
technology roadmap to address growth strategies in an effective and systemic
way, focusing on key issues such as energy, transportation, water, and public
safety. The council also has initiatives underway to address financing, policy,
and citizen engagement. To accomplish these important but challenging tasks, the
council has marshaled the world's leading authorities.

by 2015, and reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75%. Roberto Tapia-Conyer,
president of Carlos Slim Health Institute, said: "The current maternal mortality
rate demands innovative models of care that use a systematic approach. "By
joining with the West Wireless Health Institute and Qualcomm, we believe we can
demonstrate that the use of wireless technologies can transform the current
paradigm of care, improve the quality of health services and better serve a
population in need. Maternal deaths can be prevented or reduced if pregnant
women have easily accessible tools that empower them to continuously interact
with their physicians to timely detect signs of alarm and receive proper medical
care." The Wireless Pregnancy Remote Monitoring Kit includes Sense4Baby, a
wireless fetal and maternal monitoring prototype developed by the West Wireless
Health Institutean affordable 3G phonea glucometer and blood pressure meterurine
stripsand a 3G wireless embedded laptop. The Kit will enable timely and
continuous monitoring in rural and marginalized areas, bridging the gap and
enabling access to health and medical services. This is particularly beneficial
for groups at higher medical risk, including pregnant women who live in areas
where health care is not readily available. Don Casey, CEO of the West Wireless
Health Institute, said: "By leveraging low-cost wireless technologies, we not
only extend the reach of health care workers, but also ease time and travel
burdens on women with high-risk pregnancies who live far from clinical
facilities. "We are excited to be collaborating with Qualcomm and the Carlos
Slim Health Institute and hope to demonstrate the value and the potential of
this new model of care." Donald Jones, vice president of business development
for Qualcomm, said: "Many countries are challenged when it comes to providing
adequate health care. "Some of the difficulties faced include physical distance
between doctors and their patients and a limited number of skilled health care
professionals. Wireless technology extends the reach of doctors and can be
effective in overcoming these challenges by bringing the latest medical
intelligence to health care providers and their patients." Carlos Slim Health
Institute, West Wireless Health Institute and Qualcomm are collaborating to
develop new models of care that incorporate low-cost and affordable wireless
health care solutions to reduce maternal mortality and improve health in
underserved communities in Mexico.


Qualcomm And ECOtality To Enable EV Charging Stations With Cellular Connectivity


Jul 27, 2010

Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) and ECOtality Incorporated (ECOtality) have
entered into an agreement to implement cellular connectivity into charging
stations. The solution will allow ECOtality to use a commercial cellular network
to manage its Blink brand charging station operations, transfer usage data,
download firmware updates and publish availability to electric vehicle (EV)
drivers in real time.Jonathan Read, president and CEO of ECOtality, said:
"Blink's simple, smart approach to charging allows consumers the real-time
monitoring, command and control they expect while leveraging renewable energy
generation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cellular networks will play a
critical role in connecting the charging stations with ECOtality's control
systems so we can make all these benefits possible."ECOtality will begin
deploying cellular-enabled charging stations this year under the EV Project, a
$230 million project involving the US Department of EnergyECOtality's
subsidiary, ECOtality North Americaand more than 40 project partners. The EV
project is the deployment of EV and charging infrastructure in US history,
including up to 8,300 fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and nearly
15,000 at-home and publicly available charging systems. All chargers to be
deployed under this program, as well as those carrying ECOtality's recently
unveiled Blink brand, will contain Qualcomm technology to communicate over

Qualcomm Announces Project To Enable 3G Health Care Access For Rural Japanese
Communities

Jul 22, 2010

Qualcomm Incorporated (Qualcomm) and Medical Platform Asia (MedPA) have signed a
formal agreement to provide medical devices with integrated 3G wireless modules
for people in need of health services. The project is being implemented through
Qualcomm's Wireless Reach initiative and will allow 300 remote local residents
to send critical health information to doctors through a 3G wireless network.
Information such a resident's blood pressure, weight and distance walked can be
easily and immediately shared with participating physicians. The data is then
reviewed and local residents are advised to adjust their activities in order to
improve their physical condition. The health records are further analyzed by
correlating them with clinical data and other factors.There are local regions
where emergency care and advanced health care are lacking, particularly in snowy
areas such as Hokkaido where there are issues with transportation during the
winter and the circumstances make access to health care facilities more
difficult. For such areas, the ability for people to manage their own health is
important to preventing illnesses from becoming serious. The current trend is to
reduce the number of long-term care beds in hospitals to promote shorter
hospital stays and home-based nursing to reduce health care costs. This being
the case, home medical care is fast becoming important in Japan. For remote
locations, even a home visit by a doctor or nurse requires considerable time and
effort. Therefore, there is a need to increase efficiency through the ability to
remotely monitor patient risks and symptoms. Jun Yamada, senior vice president
of Qualcomm and president of Qualcomm Japan, said: "The collaboration between
Qualcomm, MedPA and other project participants will increase access to quality
health care. "We are committed to applying 3G wireless technology to improve
public health in rural areas of Japan where there is currently limited access."
MedPA will provide the 3G-enabled communication equipment in collaboration with
Chealcomm, a Japan-based MVNO that engaged in advanced wireless and wellness
services. The equipment, which is distributed through MedPA's affiliated medical
facilities, is used for monitoring vital data from people (seniors and patients
with lifestyle diseases) living in areas that are located far from a medical
facility or that face other issues, such as a scarcity of physicians. Masanori
Nishiyama, M.D., chairman of the board of directors of MedPA, said: "MedPA is
fortunate to have these companies involved to aid in the adoption and
advancement of wireless medical and wellness services in the Japanese home
market. "This project will provide close monitoring of a local resident's
condition and, by utilizing 3G wireless technology, a doctor can remotely
provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations on a regular basis." Kazuaki
Shimamoto, president and chairperson of Sapporo Medical University, said: "In
Japan, there are areas where it is difficult to see a specialist and there are
quite a few patients who don't receive adequate medical services. "I have been
building evidence via epidemiological research of patients who have had high
blood pressure for more than 30 years and in order to receive the latest
treatments based on real-time and vital data, there is a need to improve medical
access. The Japanese Society of Hypertension has stated the importance of having
home blood pressure measurement included in hypertension treatment guidelines.
With quick and simple monitoring of blood pressure at home and the ability to
receive remote treatment by specialists, this project is an important step in
improving medical access. I welcome this initiative to support underserved
patients and I truly appreciate the efforts of everyone involved in this
project."

Qualcomm disputes anti-trust claims by JFTC

Aug 14, 2009

Denies forcing customers to license patents on a royalty-free basisQualcomm said
that it disputes claims by Japan's anti trust regulator that it has forced
Japanese licensees to cross license patents to it on a royalty-free basis and
forced them to accept a provision under which licensees agreed not to assert
their essential patents against each other.In a draft order, the Japan Fair
Trade Commission (JFTC) reportedly seeks Qualcomm to modify existing licenses
with Japanese companies to eliminate these provisions while preserving the
license of Qualcomm's patents to the Japanese companies. If Qualcomm were to
eliminate these provisions as contemplated by the draft order, there is a risk
that some Japanese licensees may attempt to assert their previously licensed
patents against Qualcomm, its customers and licensees, the company said.
Qualcomm said in a statement: Qualcomm naturally disputes the notion that any
provisions in our license agreements with Japanese companies were forced upon
them. These licenses were agreed to voluntarily by the Japanese licensees many
years ago, after extensive arms-length negotiations. Indeed, the non-assert
provision was rejected by several Japanese companies, and is not even a
provision in those agreements. The company said that it will submit a written
response opposing the draft order within the next two weeks. If the
investigative staff adopts the draft order in whole or in part, Qualcomm will
request a full evidentiary hearing and review by the JFTC. Last month, the
Korean Fair Trade Commission has issued a $200m fine against Qualcomm, after
ruling that certain discounts the chip maker offers to the Korean customers on
the purchase of its CDMA chipsets are in violation of Korean competition law.
Qualcomm disagrees with the ruling.


Japan's antitrust regulator targets Qualcomm

Jul 28, 2009

Accuses Qualcomm of abusing its market dominanceThe Japan's antitrust regulator,
Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has sent a draft order to Qualcomm, accusing
it for its market dominance. The incident comes less than a week after the chip
supplier was fined over $200m by the Korean Fair trade commission.Qualcomm said
in a statement that it is unable to comment in detail until it had received the
full translation of the order. The company stated: However, it appears that the
draft is directed at common, industry-standard licensing terms that are in fact
pro-competitive and were the subject of intense negotiations with very
substantial Japanese companies. It is important to note that Qualcomm has never
seen any evidence upon which the JFTC may be relying and has not, until today,
even been aware of many of the allegations. The San Diego, California-based
Qualcomm said that it would pursue its right to file a written response before a
final decision is made by JFTC. Last week, South Korea's antitrust watchdog
imposed a largest fine on a single company, a record $208m on Qualcomm for
abusing its market dominance in the CDMA mobile phone chips. It said that the
company violated fair competition rules.

Steve Pazol, who has previously served at Qualcomm as vice president of global
smart services. Anthony Lewis, vice president of open development at Verizon
Wireless, said: The Verizon Wireless vision for bringing the benefits of
'everything connected' to the marketplace started with the introduction of the
open development business and the selection of LTE technology for our 4G
network. This distinctive partnership with Qualcomm allows us to swiftly build
on the strengths of each company's M2M strategy. The JV's focus on unlimited
innovation will enable the production of next-generation products and services
that will release the full power and potential of our network for customers.
Reportedly, the new 50:50 joint venture is yet to be christened and other
details, yet to be disclosed.

On Oct. 22 more than 30 volunteers from Hospice of Citrus County volunteers,
board members, staff, members from the community, health care providers and area
garden clubs worked together to plant shrubs and trees at the new Hospice House
at 3350 W Audubon Park Path in Lecanto.

The Hospice House is a place where people with terminal illnesses may spend
their final days when they require special care not possible at home and is
scheduled to be completed in December.

The trees were obtained through the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners
Tree Enhancement Program. Hospice of Citrus County's Director of Business
Development, Bonnie Saylor, contacted Development Services Director, Gary
Maidhof, about the program and the University of Florida IFAS Extension Services
modified the landscape requirements so that Hospice of Citrus County could use
the trees grown by the residents of the Key Training Center.

Saylor noted, "We are always looking for ways to conserve costs and continue to
offer excellent services. The county's Tree Enhancement Program saved us a
considerable amount of landscaping costs."

The Tree Enhancement Program is a joint effort between the County Commission and
Key Training Center. The County purchases the seedlings and Key Training Center
residents care for them at their nursery until they are planting size. Native
Trees such as live oak, laurel oak, red duds, and willow oaks are just a few of
the trees that where planted on the Hospice House site.

Hospice House is a capital project that is dependant upon community donations.
More than 800 individual donors and businesses and organizations have
contributed to the project. If you would like information on Hospice House or
any of the services provided by Hospice of Citrus County, call 527-2020 or visit
Hospice on the web at www.hospiceofcitruscounty.org.

LINDA NELSEN

Age: 50

Title: Senior vice president of housing, assisted living and home care for
Pathway Health Services in White Bear Lake

What do you do? I assist the senior housing continuum with health care delivery.
I am also on the faculty of two trade organizations for the senior health care
industry - Minnesota Health and Housing Alliance, and Care Providers of
Minnesota.

Education: Bachelor's degree in community health with an emphasis on health
education, Minnesota State University, Mankato; Long Term Care Administration
Licensure Program, University of Minnesota; licensed nursing home administrator

Family: My husband, Tom, is a teacher in St. Peter, Minn. We have two incredible
children: Grant, 22, and Emily, 17.

Hobbies: Attending children's sporting events, boating, golf, recreational
traveling and reading

Previous jobs: Regional director of operations for Alternative Living Services,
Good Samaritan Society and Good Neighbor Services; nursing home administrator

Other than your current position, what would be your dream job? To work with
children in foster care.

Why do you do what you do? It affects so many lives - those living in a senior
housing environment, their families, and the community, and staff that serves
them. I'm enhancing lives and expanding employees' skill levels. It's very
rewarding.

What would you rather do than go to work on Monday? Take a leisurely trip with
my family.

How did you choose this type of work? My very first job was working in a nursing
home. I've always loved working with older adults. Senior living and health care
is changing continuously and is always a new and challenging venture.

What's the biggest industry change you've experienced in your career? The
industry has addressed the fact that many of us, including our customers, would
prefer to live in a residential environment, be the person directing our service
and care, have the opportunity to ask a lot of questions, and work together with
the service providers. As providers, we continue to be innovative in finding new
ways to offer those services and provide complex care for our clients in an
environment that they choose.

ECONOMY IN AUGUSTA STILL ADDING JOBS

BYLINE: By Walter C. Jones Morris News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 367 words


ATLANTA - The Augusta economy might have been a little tepid in the first half
of the year, but things began improving around late summer, resulting in a
growth rate of 0.8 percent in the third quarter.

For the year, the final increase in jobs will be only 0.3 percent over 2004, but
it's still going in the right direction, according to a quarterly outlook
released Wednesday by Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center.

Next year's growth rate will continue, in the range of 0.9 percent, according to
the forecast. That would be less than half the state's growth rate of 1.9
percent for 2006.

In bad news, the area's 6 percent unemployment rate is tied with Macon's for
worst among the state's 13 metropolitan areas. The state's current rate is 5.3
percent.

Augusta added the most jobs in the third quarter in retailing, government,
hospitality, education and health.

Grant Sutton, the president of Windsor Jewelers, has a larger payroll than he
did at the same time last year and has built his inventory with expectations of
a banner year ahead.

"The jewelry business is very, very healthy," he said.

Two massive hurricanes, Delta Air Lines' bankruptcy and yo-yo energy prices
haven't stalled the economy, according to the forecast. Mr. Sutton attributes
that to human nature.

"I think Americans have a very short memory," he said.

Rajeev Dhawan, the director of the forecasting center, sees a silver lining in
the storms for Georgia as conventions and tourism shift away from the Gulf
Coast. Nationally, the sting will be slight.

"I expect the one-two punch from Katrina and Rita to impact gross domestic
product growth negatively by only 0.2 percent over the next four quarters," he
said.

Augusta has a few factors in its favor. The forecast says the area will benefit
from the start of a six-year, multimillion-dollar military-intelligence project
that will eventually bring hundreds of jobs to Fort Gordon.

News that food processor Castleberry is adding 200 jobs will also help.

The health care segment of the economy has resumed its pace of job creation
after a pause earlier this year. That could also benefit a city like Augusta.

Submitted story

OXFORD -- The Granville Health System Foundation has awarded Kaitlin Mize of
Oxford the second annual Sam Perry Scholarship.

Mize, the daughter of Howard and Lisa Mize of Oxford, recently graduated with
honors from N.C. State University with a B.S. degree in psychology. She will be
entering the Duke University Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program
this fall.

The Foundation established the scholarship fund in memory of Sam Perry, a
physician's assistant whose specialized medical care had earned him deep respect
from both patients and peers throughout his career.

"Sam would be proud to see this talented young woman rewarded for her dedication
and achievement in pursuit of a nursing career," said Gary Bowman, President of
the Granville Health System Foundation. "We will continue to honor Sam's vision
by seeking out exceptional students in the field of allied health for this
scholarship."

The Sam Perry Scholarship is awarded to a Granville County resident who has been
accepted into a two-year or four-year Allied Health Program at an accredited
school and who intends to pursue a career in the allied health care field.
Programs eligible for this scholarship include clinical laboratory sciences,
physical therapy, occupational therapy, radiological science, pharmacy, RN, BSN,
AND, LPN, dentistry and related careers, physician assistant, and nurse
practitioner.

During three semesters, Mize served as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at
N.C. State University. She was also a recipient of the 2010 College of
Humanities and Social Sciences Dean's Scholarship. While a member of Delta Zeta
Sorority at NCSU, Ms. Mize served two semesters each as Academics Chairman and
Athletic Chairman, and was the New Member Panhellenic Voting Delegate. She also
participated in philanthropic events to raise money for the Delta Zeta
Foundation.

She graduated 10th in her class from J. F. Webb School of Health and Life
Sciences in 2007.

Mize has actively participated in a number of community service activities. She
volunteered in the Nutrition NUTS program, teaching nutrition education to
children and parents at Head Start centers; was a camp counselor for hearing
impaired children at Camp Woodbine; volunteered at the Salvation Army;
volunteered at Constraint Induced Movement Therapy Camp; and helped at the
Triangle Wine Experience event, which raised money for the Frankie Lemmon School
in Raleigh, at which Mize did an internship.

Tentative deal cuts wage increase for GM Moraine workers

MORAINE - A tentative agreement last week between General Motors Corp. and the
union for hourly workers at GM's Moraine Assembly plant will eliminate a wage
increase this September and transfer some health care costs to retirees, a union
official said Thursday.

The agreement also grants GM-requested changes in work rules at the sport
utility vehicle plant, said Henry Reichard of the International Union of
Electronic Workers-Communications Workers of America.

The deal would change terms of the union's existing contract with GM at Moraine,
so it is subject to a Thursday ratification vote by members of IUE-CWA Local
798, which represents Moraine's 3,800 hourly production employees.

Reichard said he expects the contract to be ratified, coming at a time of GM's
multibillion-dollar losses, declining North American market share and shutdown
of excess automaking capacity.

Deal between Delta, pilots union could avert strike, according to memo

ATLANTA - Delta Air Lines Inc. and its pilots union have reached a tentative
agreement on pay and benefit cuts that could avert a strike, according to a memo
Friday from the union to its pilots. No details of the agreement were released.
The pilots union had threatened to strike if its contract was thrown out. Delta,
which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since September, has said
in court papers that a pilot strike would put it out of business.

Delta, based in Atlanta, has its second-largest hub at Cincinnati/Northern
Kentucky International Airport.

Alcoa plans to sell home exteriors business, including Sidney plant

SIDNEY - Alcoa Inc., the world's biggest aluminum producer, said Thursday it
plans to sell its U.S.-focused home exteriors business, including a plant that
employs 320 workers in Sidney.

The plant, which began operating in 1963, makes siding, gutters, downspouts and
other aluminum products.

State agency wants Ohio justices to toss Duke Energy-Cinergy merger

DAYTON - The Ohio Consumers' Counsel, a state agency representing residential
consumers in utility rate cases, has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to throw out
the merger in which Duke Energy Corp. absorbed Cinergy Corp. earlier this month.
The counsel contends the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio erred in approving
the $9 billion merger.

The merged company, based in Charlotte, N.C., obtained approvals from the
federal government and the five states where it operates: Ohio, Kentucky,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Gas prices jumped as high as 30 cents a gallon in Dayton area

DAYTON - Gasoline prices in the Dayton area spiked Tuesday, jumping 20 or even
30 cents a gallon at many area stations. Pump prices around $2.80 a gallon for
regular became the rule, as futures for light crude approached $69 a barrel.

A U.S. Energy information Administration weekly report showed an
18-cent-a-gallon jump in average Ohio prices in the past two weeks and a
43-cent-a-gallon surge from a year ago.

Americans are expected to use 1.5 percent more gasoline than last summer,
according to AAA.

Gem City Records sale finalized; new owner says expect more DVDs

DAYTON - On Tuesday, John Huffman closed the deal to sell Gem City Records to
Value Music Concepts Inc., a privately held company based in Marietta, Ga., that
operates 61 home entertainment stores in 22 states.

Gem City Records is located at 318 E. Fifth St. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed.

Huffman founded the Gem City 25 years ago, carving out a niche for hard-to-find
and import records, foreign movies and eventually indie rock selections.

Rob Perkins, Value's president and chief executive officer, said the customers
will notice an enhanced selection of new and used music and movies. The company
will be adding more DVDs and vinyl records.

Air Force plans to bring at least 100 call center jobs to region

WASHINGTON - The Air Force on Monday announced plans to bring at least 100 Air
Force call center jobs to the Dayton region.

Under an Air Force plan, the region, and possibly the former site of the
Kettering Defense Finance and Accounting Service center - would become the new
home to the Air Force Claims Service center, slated to open in fiscal 2007.

Meanwhile, new figures detail the dramatic growth Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base expects from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process.

Base engineers estimate they will need 1.1 million square feet of new
construction and renovation in 17 projects at a cost of more than $370 million
for offices, laboratories and medical training facilities.

Two Mustangs, one driver

To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the Ronald McDonald House of Long Island is
raffling off not one, but two Mustangs to one lucky winner. In keeping with the
"Looking Back ... Moving Forward" theme of the New Hyde Park nonprofit's gala
silver anniversary celebration, one winner will come away with both a 1965
Mustang, courtesy of the East to West Classic Car Club, and a 2012 version,
donated by Ford Lincoln of Queens and CBS News. No more than 2,500 tickets will
be sold, at $100 each, and winners will be announced during the gala, which will
take place at Citi Field in Queens on March 24.

"We are incorporating the theme to recognize our history and present/future, and
we thought it would be unique and more appealing" for one winner to win both
cars, rather than have two separate winners, said Deepika Thadhani, a
spokesperson for RMH-LI.

Radio days for children

Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York was the beneficiary of a recent
WCBS-FM radiothon. The two-day event, entitled "CBS Loves Our Kids," was
broadcast live from the New Hyde Park hospital, which is part of the North
Shore-LIJ Health System. The radiothon raised $261,295 to support CCMC's child
life and creative art therapy programs.

CCMC's child life program, which touches tens of thousands of people each year,
feature specialists that are trained in a variety of disciplines to help
children and their families cope with the anxieties associated with
hospitalization. Many individuals and businesses, including the New York
Yankees, the New York Mets and Delta Airlines, participated in the radiothon by
providing merchandise certificates and matching grants to incentivize listeners
to call in with pledges.

In 2011, CBS Radio, in partnership with the Children's Miracle Network, raised
more than $48 million through local radiothons benefitting children's hospitals
in communities across North America. "CBS Radio is a driving force behind these
efforts, clearly recognizing the power of their radio brands and leveraging them
to change the lives of children and families throughout North America," Kevin
Carraccio, vice president of the North Shore-LIJ Health System Foundation, said
in a statement.

Health care reform made as easy as ABC

Last week, the Hauppauge-based Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council launched a public
information campaign to help Long Islanders understand the federal health care
reform law.

Entitled "The ABCs of Health Care Reform and You," the NSHC's web-based and
social media-driven campaign will share basic information about the Affordable
Care Act as it relates to particular population segments, including the
uninsured, young adults, seniors, chronic disease sufferers and businesses.
Messages will focus on access ("A"), benefits ("B") and costs ("C").

As health care reform approaches its second anniversary in March, opinion polls
show that many Americans still do not understand the law, according to the NSHC.
"It is important to us to help not only our hospital members, but the general
public gain a relatable understanding of the law as it affects them. ... A
better understanding of the ACA leads to more informed health care decisions,"
Wendy Darwell, COO of the NSHC, said in a statement.

Only flexible employers need apply

The National Association of Mothers' Centers, a Jericho-based nonprofit,
announced that applications are now being accepted for the 2012 Alfred P. Sloan
Awards for Business Excellence in Workplace Flexibility. The free competition is
open to for-profit and nonprofit employers with 10 or more employees.

NAMC, host of the annual Long Island awards ceremony in the fall, is a partner
of the national When Work Works program, a research-based initiative of the
Families and Work Institute and the Society for Human Resource Management. The
deadline for applications is April 16; visit www.whenworkworks.org.

Giving back through tax returns

With tax season getting into full swing, Bethpage Federal Credit Union launched
its ninth annual Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program last week. At 12 of its
branches in Nassau and Suffolk, the Bethpage-based institution is providing free
assistance with tax return preparation for qualifying families with incomes of
$49,000 or less.

Last year, 1,300 tax returns were completed in Bethpage's VITA program, with a
total of $1.8 million refunded by the IRS. This year, the credit union doubled
its number of volunteers and increased its number of participating branches.

Stepping forward for cancer research

Last week, the Stony Brook University Cancer Center was presented with a check
for $50,000 to support cancer research. The funds were raised in last fall's
18th annual Walk for Beauty in Stony Brook, a collaboration between the
hospital, the Ward Melville Heritage Organization of Stony Brook and area
businesses, schools and governmental leaders.

When the walk began in 1994, it raised funds exclusively for breast cancer
research. In 2002, the scope was broadened to include prostate cancer research,
but last year, organizers returned to the event's original focus on breast
cancer research exclusively.

Over the past 18 years, the walk has raised $1.1 million for cancer research at
Stony Brook. "Why are we successful? Because we put one foot in front of the
other, and we keep walking," Gloria Rocchio, president of WMHO and co-chair for
the 2011 event, said in a statement.

Adelphi's hotline number is on the bag

Through a new partnership, the Adelphi NY Statewide Breast Cancer Hotline &
Support Program is getting its phone number into the hands of potato
chip-eaters. The Garden City-based program's 800 number is now printed on the
snack bags as well as the pink delivery trucks of Pink Snacks, a Collegeville,
Pa.-based manufacturer of potato chips, potato sticks and pretzels that donates
70 percent of its proceeds to the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

"When we heard about this wonderful resource of the Adelphi Breast Cancer
Hotline, we knew we wanted to help get the word out so that women in need would
know that the hotline is there to help them," Damon Greco, founder of Pink
Snacks, said in a statement.

"We hope someone who needs help with breast cancer issues will see the truck or
a bag of potato chips and call us," said Lyn Dobrin, a spokesperson for the
Adelphi hotline.

Season for marching on Albany

Last week, Citizens Campaign for the Environment, a Farmingdale-based nonprofit,
participated in the 2012 Hydro-fracking Day of Action in Albany. CCE arranged
for vans to transport two dozen Long Islanders to the state's capital, where
they joined a rally of about 750 people in the legislative office building,
expressing concerns about the drilling for natural gas throughout the state. The
advocates also held meetings with 187 Senate and Assembly members, according to
Adrienne Esposito, executive director of CCE, which claims hydro-fracking has
been documented to cause contamination of drinking water, air and land.

On Feb. 14, a busload of Long Island arts advocates plans to travel to Albany to
join a statewide contingent of representatives from arts councils, museums,
cultural organizations and individual artists. The arts advocates will call on
state legislators to support the New York State Council on the Arts, which
provides grants and services to support cultural institutions and arts programs
throughout the state. The bus trip is being organized by the Huntington Arts
Council, in partnership with other Long Island arts organizations. "This is an
important opportunity to remind our state senators and representatives how
valuable arts and cultural services are in communities," Diana J. Cherryholmes,
executive director of the Huntington Arts Council, said in a statement.

Ailing hospital, health woes plague Bootheel residents Pemiscot County has high
rates of infant mortality, obesity and disease - and a shortage of doctors at a
struggling facility. HEALTH CARE: CHANGES AND CHOICES

BYLINE:  By Jim Doyle jdoyle@post-dispatch.com 314-340-8372

o Official warned lawmakers that decision to not expand Medicaid would shut its
doors.

CARUTHERSVILLE, Mo. o Many of the customers at the Round House, a popular
restaurant in this southeastern Missouri farming town, see health care access as
a cut-and-dried issue.

"We have enough doctors and hospitals," said Earl Bullington, a frequent Round
House patron.

The problem in Pemiscot County, said the retired farm credit manager and cotton
farmer's son, is that "a large percentage of the local population is (on)
Medicaid. We have a lot of people who abuse the (government) card they get. Lots
of doctor visits are made for unnecessary things."

That view is typical in these parts, except among those who are unemployed,
uninsured and broke.

Fact is, life expectancy in Pemiscot County is lower than in El Salvador - and
the lowest in the state of Missouri, the state's hospital association says.
(Then again, the life expectancy within the city limits of St. Louis is only
slightly better.)

This Missouri Bootheel county, with a population of about 18,200, is one of the
state's poorest, a fact reflected in high rates of infant mortality, obesity and
disease. Its poverty has been well-documented for decades - the equivalent of a
festering boil that's targeted occasionally by federal and state bureaucrats,
health advocates and assorted do-gooders.

The county's only hospital, Pemiscot County Memorial, serves a large population
of the poor and uninsured. Located in Hayti, nearly 200 miles south of St.
Louis, the hospital has struggled financially for years. Area residents
recognize its limitations.

"We have a good 'First Aid Station,'" said Harlin Crayne, a lifelong resident of
Caruthersville. "It's a good place to get stabilized, and then they shoot you
somewhere else."

Crayne, now in his 60s, knows. At 38, he suffered a heart attack and, once
stabilized, was flown by helicopter to Memphis, Tenn., for follow-up care. A few
years ago, he had heart trouble again, and was rushed out of the area for
specialty care.

The local First Aid Station is now in jeopardy.

Without an expansion of the Medicaid program - the government program that
provides health care coverage for some of the poor and disabled - the hospital
likely will close, Kerry Noble, the hospital's chief financial officer and
former CEO, told state lawmakers earlier this year.

At the time, Noble's warning was dismissed as fear-mongering by Missouri House
Speaker Tim Jones, a Republican and a fierce opponent of the Affordable Care
Act. And Missouri lawmakers subsequently refused to expand Medicaid.

Whether Noble's prediction proves prescient remains to be seen. Poverty-stricken
rural areas, where health needs are great and resources few, may pose the
ultimate test of President Barack Obama's signature health reform law as well as
state Medicaid programs. In the end, will the nation's most neglected
populations have greater access to health care or less?

PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE

The Bootheel's shortage of physicians cuts across the region's yawning chasm
between the haves and have-nots, especially for those whose families have lived
for generations in poverty in the Mississippi Delta region.

When Amber Ely, 33, of Kennett in nearby Dunklin County, needed medical
attention, local providers referred her to a specialist in Cape Girardeau, a
90-minute drive.

Ely, who is partially blind and on Medicaid, was pregnant.

She had suffered a stroke a few years ago, and physicians wanted to be certain
that her pregnancy and delivery would go smoothly. She recently gave birth at
St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau, more than an hour's drive away.

"My daughter has been getting beautiful, beautiful care" in Cape Girardeau, said
Ely's father, Frank Bailey, of Southaven, Miss.

Curtis Hicks, who is disabled and lives in Hayti, said that he walked into
Pemiscot County Memorial Hospital's emergency room a few months ago around 11
p.m. He had chest pains, and waited for four hours without being seen.

"I finally walked out. I was the only one in the waiting room," Hicks said. "I
had Medicaid. They wouldn't even take my information. They didn't act like they
cared. ... If I had a car, I would've taken it to Kennett or the Cape."

Kennett, located 17 miles away in Dunklin County, is the home of Twin Rivers
Regional Medical Center, a for-profit hospital. Cape Girardeau has two large
nonprofit hospitals.

"Back in the day, Pemiscot was a good hospital," Hicks said. "Someone needs to
buy (them) out."

Katrina Robertson, an intake specialist at the nonprofit Bootheel Area
Independent Living Services, or BAILS, in Kennett, said that primary care
physicians and surgeons who practice in the Bootheel area tend to stay only a
few years. Many doctors become frustrated with their patients' lack of
compliance with their instructions.

Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, she said, will "be warming up
TV dinners in the microwave, which is going to cause their blood sugar to go up
and land them back in the ER."

BAILS, a community-based nonprofit organization that serves Dunklin, Pemiscot,
New Madrid and Stoddard counties, helps residents apply for Medicaid and
arranges transportation and in-home services for the disabled.

Robertson said about 90 percent of referrals by local providers for specialty
care are to specialists based outside the Bootheel, including for patients who
need dialysis, cardiology and neurology services.

Her 17-year-old son Will, for instance, made several trips this year to see a
hand surgeon in Little Rock, Ark., after he suffered an injury playing
basketball.

The Delta Regional Authority, a federal-state partnership focused on development
in the Mississippi Delta, has a visa waiver program that allows foreign doctors
who are trained in the United States to work in medically underserved areas for
at least three years. But the shortage of Bootheel physicians persists.

A TRAIL OF STATISTICS

In the last two decades, Missouri's overall health care rating has eroded.

In 1990, the UnitedHealthcare Foundation ranked Missouri 24th in the nation.
Today, the state ranks 45th - and the Bootheel has some of the worst chronic
disease rates in the state.

Pemiscot County's sickly population spends a lot of time in the hospital.

Residents are hospitalized more than twice as often as the average Missouri
resident, according to the Delta Regional Authority. Hospital inpatient days per
1,000 residents in Pemiscot County is 1,858; the Missouri average is 719 days;
the U.S. average is 643 days.

Academics point to socioeconomic factors:

o Less than 60 percent of the county's adults ages 25 or older has a high school
degree; nearly 20 percent of these adults have less than nine years of public
education.

o The percentage of Pemiscot County residents living in poverty is more than
twice as high as the state average, Missouri officials say.

o According to the U.S. Census, the county's unemployment rates are also
significantly higher than the state average.

But there's no escaping the region's shortage of doctors. Pemiscot County, on a
per capita basis, has about one-fifth the number of doctors and dentists than
the state average.

"I've had numerous patients who have died because of lack of access to primary
care," said Dr. Abdullah Arshad, who provides emergency care at the hospital. "I
had two patients who lost their legs because they did not have Medicaid and
could not afford their medication. I had a patient with the HIV virus who died
of HIV because she did not have Medicaid or insurance."

He said that one of his patients - a young woman with nodules in her lungs -
died of metastatic lung cancer in August because she could not afford an X-ray.

FINANCIAL WOES

Pemiscot County Memorial Hospital, the county's second-largest employer, opened
in 1951 - when the county's population exceeded 45,000, more than twice its
current level. In subsequent decades, as agriculture changed and machines
replaced farm workers, people left the region. Now, the 49-bed hospital is in
trouble.

The hospital had total revenue last year of $94 million and a net loss of
$759,000, according to the American Hospital Directory.

The county's annual contribution to the hospital is about $634,000, said Ben
Baker, a county commissioner who also oversees a NAPA auto parts store in
Caruthersville.

"The county's broke as hell," Baker said. "We had people on the hospital board
with conflicts of interest. We have a new board now."

According to the Caruthersville-Hayti Democrat Argus newspaper, the hospital's
board of directors resigned recently after allegations surfaced that the panel
had awarded a lucrative hospital contract for billing services to then-board
chairman Glen Haynes.

In August, state officials agreed to release $1 million in emergency funds to
the hospital, which began to lay off or furlough some of its workers to reduce
its payroll. And the county's primary care clinic increased its prices by 20
percent.

Jack Pennington, the hospital's chief executive officer, declined to comment
about the hospital's finances, plans or the recent scandal.

The county's hospital system "almost went through a bankruptcy proceeding.
There's just no money there," Arshad said. "We need somehow for the government
to support us when we care for an uninsured patient."

Under new federal rules, the hospital is being penalized for its higher than
average readmission rates. If a discharged patient fails to take prescribed
drugs or to show up at doctor's appointments and becomes sick again, the
hospital has no choice but to readmit the patient - and is penalized for it.

"We need help with our equipment," Arshad said, stressing that the hospital's
key technology is more than 20 years old. "Our MRI machine has been down for two
weeks. Our cardiac stress machine has been down for a month."

Still, he voices optimism about the hospital's future. "The hospital will find a
way to be viable. The hospital will stay open," he said. "But I fear that the
hospital will be in the same situation two or three years from now."

A DOCTOR'S PERSPECTIVE

Arshad, whose specialty is internal medicine, also provides primary care and ad
hoc specialty services at a county-run clinic across the street from the
hospital. He sees 30 to 50 patients a day.

"I do everything from cardiology to neurology and pulmonology and oncology,"
Arshad said. "City physicians don't want to do that. They don't want to accept
the responsibility."

He said the Medicaid program has a long waiting list of Bootheel patients who
need to see specialists. "The number of uninsured has increased. The number of
sub-specialists has decreased," he said, referring in particular to doctors who
specialize in heart, lung, eye and cancer care.

"Of course there is a shortage of doctors," Arshad said, "but the real problem
in this area is the patients' inability to access what we have."

He said that several factors conspire to limit health access for the poor,
beginning with a lack of insurance. About 15 percent of Pemiscot County adults
younger than 65 are uninsured, a level that is roughly in line with the state.

Pemiscot County's primary care clinics in Hayti, Caruthersville and Steele offer
sliding-scale rates for doctor appointments, but no discounts for medications,
resulting in many patients not filling their prescriptions and getting sicker.

A lack of education among the poor is also a big factor.

"The patients just don't realize that they should care about their health," he
said, adding that it's not uncommon for 10 people and three pets to be living in
a small trailer. "Even if they don't smoke, they get secondhand smoke."

Another key factor is limited public transportation. Buses run along the
Bootheel's main arteries, but not along the smaller veins including gravel roads
where many people live - often without cars or phones.

Some of Arshad's patients walk to his clinic in Hayti from the town of Holcomb -
population 631 - in Dunklin County, a distance of 10 miles.

"These patients can't go anywhere," Arshad said. "They don't have cars. They
don't have the gas money."

He recalled an elderly woman who showed up at the hospital two weeks after
suffering a stroke. The left side of her body was paralyzed.

HEALTHY SOLUTIONS

It's difficult to identify potential solutions to problems that seem
intractable, experts say. But the region's ongoing economic troubles, including
its dearth of jobs and health disparities, have drawn the focus of academics.

Since the 1990s, researchers from St. Louis University have explored ways to
address the high rates of heart disease among African-Americans in Pemiscot
County, which are about 60 percent above the state average. The researchers cite
the apparent correlation between the county's few economic opportunities with
some residents' loss of hope, depression, low self-esteem and high stress
levels.

The Bootheel's fertile, black delta soil has long yielded cotton, soybeans,
wheat, corn and rice crops. More recently, a novel partnership has blossomed
there between SLU researchers and community health advocates.

"It's not enough for us to go out into the community and encourage people to eat
right and exercise," said Freda Motton, the project's community liaison. "These
people are poverty-stricken. They don't even know where their next meal is
coming from, let alone have time to think about eating high-priced fruits and
vegetables. They can't yet hear that message.

"The thinking was that people going to the grocery store are reaching for all
the wrong things," she said, citing the need to eat more healthy foods with less
salt and less fat. "What good is it to take a person's blood pressure if they
can't even afford to go to the doctor? If they have high blood pressure, what's
the next step?"

Inspired by a village garden that had sprung up years ago in Caruthersville, the
city of Hayti and two private landowners donated plots of land. To lower the
risk of heart disease, they would grow their own food.

A dozen unemployed men, including felons, who had participated in "Men on the
Move" job-readiness workshops were hired to work part time in three community
gardens. They planted cucumbers, squash, tomatoes, greens, watermelon, peas and
eggplant. They set up a produce stand in Hayti to sell fresh produce at
dirt-cheap prices.

Recipes, nutrition-education materials and cooking demonstrations were developed
to echo the harvest. Similar gardens were established in Dunklin, Scott and
Mississippi counties.

But not long after the program's launch, its grant through the National
Institutes of Health recently ended - leaving researchers and community health
advocates scrambling to find new funding streams.

"We did have some successes," said Motton, explaining that men who worked in the
gardens moved on to other local jobs. "It gave them a step up. It ignited hope
in them. They learned communication skills, teamwork and decision-making. ...
Just because the grant ends, doesn't mean the work ends."

Low-income students' test fees funded

West Virginia will receive nearly $53,000 from the U.S. Department of Education
to cover fees charged to low-income students who take Advanced Placement tests.

It is part of $21.5 million in grants announced Wednesday to 43 states. The
funding is expected to pay up to $38 per Advanced Placement exam for as many as
three exams per student.

Federal education officials say the program is intended to encourage low-income
students to take the tests, obtain college credit for high school courses, and
reduce the cost and time required to complete a postsecondary degree.

Funding levels per state were determined on state estimates of the number of
tests taken by low-income students.

2 W.Va. groups receive development grants

Two West Virginia-based economic development initiatives will receive federal
grants to help spur job creation.

The Obama administration announced Wednesday that the Shepherdstown-based West
Virginia Value Chain Cluster Initiative will receive $815,000, while the
Huntington-based Southern West Virginia Rural Jobs Accelerator Partnership will
receive $718,000.

They are among 13 winning projects in a multi-agency competition called the
Rural Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge.

The competition is being funded by the U.S. departments of Agriculture and
Commerce, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority.

Man pleads guilty to torching building

HUNTINGTON - A Huntington man convicted of torching an apartment building will
be sentenced in October.

Twenty-four-year-old Quinton L. Kennie pleaded guilty Wednesday in Cabell County
Circuit Court to first-degree arson.

The Feb. 2 fire destroyed the apartment building and displaced about a dozen
residents.

Cabell County prosecutor Chris Chiles tells the Herald-Dispatch that Kennie
isn't a suspect in dozens of other suspicious fires that have occurred in
Huntington since November 2011.

Insurers to give 16,000 W.Va. customers rebates

Health insurance companies will give rebates totaling $2.7 million to more than
16,000 customers in West Virginia this year.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says most of the rebates will
go to people who buy their own health insurance. People in small group plans
will share $400,000 in rebates.

The rebates are for billing customers more than allowed under the new federal
health-care law. Companies cannot spend more than 20 percent of revenues on
administrative costs.

Sen. Jay Rockefeller inserted that provision into the law. He told the
Charleston Daily Mail through a spokeswoman that some insurers have raised
prices to boost profits instead of paying for medical care.

Mountaineer Gas seeks rate reduction

Lower natural gas costs are prompting Mountaineer Gas Co. to seek a 10.8 percent
rate reduction for the average residential customer.

The utility filed the request Wednesday with the state Public Service
Commission.

Mountaineer Gas still has pending before the commission a request made last year
for a 4.9 percent base-rate increase.

The Charleston Daily Mail reports that if approved, the requests overall would
reduce residential customers' rates by 5.38 percent, or $3.38 a month, over the
next year.

Mountaineer Gas has more than 226,000 customers in 48 counties.

Here's how members of Congress voted on major issues last week, according to
Voterama in Congress,

House

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES

For: 303/Against: 114

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 2117) to repeal new Department of Education
rules governing for- profit colleges and universities. One rule requires such
institutions to meet accreditation requirements in each state in which they have
students and establishes state-by-state processes for handling student
complaints. Another rule targeted by the bill sets a uniform definition of what
constitutes a credit hour for purposes of allocating federal financial aid. The
rules are scheduled to take effect in July 2014. For-profit schools, many of
which specialize in online or "distance" degree programs, account for 11 percent
of U.S. higher-education students and rely heavily on federally backed student
loans and federal grants for their revenue. Their students receive about
one-quarter of all student loans and make up 43 percent of those who default on
such loans, according to the Department of Education. Some of the best- known
for-profit institutions are Capella, Kaplan and DeVry universities and the
University of Phoenix. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

STUDENT GRIEVANCES

For: 170/Against: 247

The House rejected the creation of a formal process by which students could file
grievances with state education officials against for-profit colleges and
universities. The process would give students a channel for venting complaints
over matters such as quality of instruction and financial aid disputes. The
bill's opponents said state accrediting agencies are already set up to hear such
complaints. As a result of this vote, the Department of Education's new rule
requiring state-by-state complaint procedures would be repealed as part of HR
2117 (above).

A yes vote backed the new rule for handling student complaints.

CALIFORNIA WATER DISPUTE

For: 246/Against: 175

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1837) that would override or weaken
California and federal laws and compacts for allocating San Joaquin River water
in the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The bill would
direct more water to agricultural users in the Central Valley and less to the
benefit of farming in the delta and fishing, environmental and recreational
interests in other parts of California and in Oregon. The bill would override
the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act and undercut the San Joaquin
River Settlement, a pact between environmentalists and farmers aimed at boosting
salmon populations in California and Oregon. The bill would extend the duration
of irrigation contracts from 25 to 40 years and reinstate a 1994 agreement, the
Bay-Delta Accord, which environmentalists and salmon-fishing interests have
since turned against. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

SENATE

HEALTH CARE AND RELIGION

For: 51/Against: 48

The Senate tabled (killed) an amendment enabling employers and insurance firms
to refuse to insure any medical procedure, item or device that conflicts with
their "religious beliefs and moral convictions." Although debate focused on
contraceptive care and women's health, both sides agreed the amendment was broad
enough to allow denials for any type of care, including preventive services,
specified as Essential Health Benefits in the 2010 Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay
for theologically objectionable services. The administration says there will be
no cost to insurers because by covering preventive care, they will save money in
the long run. This amendment, which was offered to a pending transportation bill
(S 1813), went one step further by providing any employer or insurance firm the
same opt-out privilege the administration has granted to religious institutions.
A yes vote was to kill the amendment.

STUDENT GRIEVANCES

For: 170/Against: 247

The House rejected the creation of a formal process by which students could file
grievances with state education officials against for-profit colleges and
universities. The process would give students a channel for venting complaints
over matters such as quality of instruction and financial aid disputes. The
bill's opponents said state accrediting agencies are already set up to hear such
complaints. As a result of this vote, the Department of Education's new rule
requiring state-by-state complaint procedures would be repealed as part of HR
2117 (above).

A yes vote backed the new rule for handling student complaints.

CALIFORNIA WATER DISPUTE

For: 246/Against: 175

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1837) that would override or weaken
California and federal laws and compacts for allocating San Joaquin River water
in the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The bill would
direct more water to agricultural users in the Central Valley and less to the
benefit of farming in the delta and fishing, environmental and recreational
interests in other parts of California and in Oregon. The bill would override
the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act and undercut the San Joaquin
River Settlement, a pact between environmentalists and farmers aimed at boosting
salmon populations in California and Oregon. The bill would extend the duration
of irrigation contracts from 25 to 40 years and reinstate a 1994 agreement, the
Bay-Delta Accord, which environmentalists and salmon-fishing interests have
since turned against. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

SENATE

HEALTH CARE AND RELIGION

For: 51/Against: 48

The Senate tabled (killed) an amendment enabling employers and insurance firms
to refuse to insure any medical procedure, item or device that conflicts with
their "religious beliefs and moral convictions." Although debate focused on
contraceptive care and women's health, both sides agreed the amendment was broad
enough to allow denials for any type of care, including preventive services,
specified as Essential Health Benefits in the 2010 Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay
for theologically objectionable services. The administration says there will be
no cost to insurers because by covering preventive care, they will save money in
the long run. This amendment, which was offered to a pending transportation bill
(S 1813), went one step further by providing any employer or insurance firm the
same opt-out privilege the administration has granted to religious institutions.
A yes vote was to kill the amendment.

2012, Thomas Voting Reports

Here's how members of Congress voted on major issues last week, according to
Voterama in Congress,

House

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES

For: 303/Against: 114

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 2117) to repeal new Department of Education
rules governing for- profit colleges and universities. One rule requires such
institutions to meet accreditation requirements in each state in which they have
students and establishes state-by-state processes for handling student
complaints. Another rule targeted by the bill sets a uniform definition of what
constitutes a credit hour for purposes of allocating federal financial aid. The
rules are scheduled to take effect in July 2014. For-profit schools, many of
which specialize in online or "distance" degree programs, account for 11 percent
of U.S. higher-education students and rely heavily on federally backed student
loans and federal grants for their revenue. Their students receive about
one-quarter of all student loans and make up 43 percent of those who default on
such loans, according to the Department of Education. Some of the best- known
for-profit institutions are Capella, Kaplan and DeVry universities and the
University of Phoenix. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay
for theologically objectionable services. The administration says there will be
no cost to insurers because by covering preventive care, they will save money in
the long run. This amendment, which was offered to a pending transportation bill
(S 1813), went one step further by providing any employer or insurance firm the
same opt-out privilege the administration has granted to religious institutions.
A yes vote was to kill the amendment.

2012, Thomas Voting Reports

Here's how members of Congress voted on major issues last week, according to
Voterama in Congress,

House

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES

For: 303/Against: 114

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 2117) to repeal new Department of Education
rules governing for- profit colleges and universities. One rule requires such
institutions to meet accreditation requirements in each state in which they have
students and establishes state-by-state processes for handling student
complaints. Another rule targeted by the bill sets a uniform definition of what
constitutes a credit hour for purposes of allocating federal financial aid. The
rules are scheduled to take effect in July 2014. For-profit schools, many of
which specialize in online or "distance" degree programs, account for 11 percent
of U.S. higher-education students and rely heavily on federally backed student
loans and federal grants for their revenue. Their students receive about
one-quarter of all student loans and make up 43 percent of those who default on
such loans, according to the Department of Education. Some of the best- known
for-profit institutions are Capella, Kaplan and DeVry universities and the
University of Phoenix. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

grievances with state education officials against for-profit colleges and

CALIFORNIA WATER DISPUTE

For: 246/Against: 175

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1837) that would override or weaken
California and federal laws and compacts for allocating San Joaquin River water
in the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The bill would
direct more water to agricultural users in the Central Valley and less to the
benefit of farming in the delta and fishing, environmental and recreational
interests in other parts of California and in Oregon. The bill would override
the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act and undercut the San Joaquin
River Settlement, a pact between environmentalists and farmers aimed at boosting
salmon populations in California and Oregon. The bill would extend the duration
of irrigation contracts from 25 to 40 years and reinstate a 1994 agreement, the
Bay-Delta Accord, which environmentalists and salmon-fishing interests have
since turned against. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

SENATE

HEALTH CARE AND RELIGION

For: 51/Against: 48

The Senate tabled (killed) an amendment enabling employers and insurance firms
to refuse to insure any medical procedure, item or device that conflicts with
their "religious beliefs and moral convictions." Although debate focused on
contraceptive care and women's health, both sides agreed the amendment was broad
enough to allow denials for any type of care, including preventive services,
specified as Essential Health Benefits in the 2010 Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay

CALIFORNIA WATER DISPUTE

For: 246/Against: 175

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1837) that would override or weaken
California and federal laws and compacts for allocating San Joaquin River water
in the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The bill would
direct more water to agricultural users in the Central Valley and less to the
benefit of farming in the delta and fishing, environmental and recreational
interests in other parts of California and in Oregon. The bill would override
the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act and undercut the San Joaquin
River Settlement, a pact between environmentalists and farmers aimed at boosting
salmon populations in California and Oregon. The bill would extend the duration
of irrigation contracts from 25 to 40 years and reinstate a 1994 agreement, the
Bay-Delta Accord, which environmentalists and salmon-fishing interests have
since turned against. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

SENATE

HEALTH CARE AND RELIGION

For: 51/Against: 48

The Senate tabled (killed) an amendment enabling employers and insurance firms
to refuse to insure any medical procedure, item or device that conflicts with
their "religious beliefs and moral convictions." Although debate focused on
contraceptive care and women's health, both sides agreed the amendment was broad
enough to allow denials for any type of care, including preventive services,
specified as Essential Health Benefits in the 2010 Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay
for theologically objectionable services. The administration says there will be
no cost to insurers because by covering preventive care, they will save money in
the long run. This amendment, which was offered to a pending transportation bill
(S 1813), went one step further by providing any employer or insurance firm the
same opt-out privilege the administration has granted to religious institutions.
A yes vote was to kill the amendment.

2012, Thomas Voting Reports

Here's how members of Congress voted on major issues last week, according to
Voterama in Congress,

House

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES

For: 303/Against: 114

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 2117) to repeal new Department of Education
rules governing for- profit colleges and universities. One rule requires such
institutions to meet accreditation requirements in each state in which they have
students and establishes state-by-state processes for handling student
complaints. Another rule targeted by the bill sets a uniform definition of what
constitutes a credit hour for purposes of allocating federal financial aid. The
rules are scheduled to take effect in July 2014. For-profit schools, many of
which specialize in online or "distance" degree programs, account for 11 percent
of U.S. higher-education students and rely heavily on federally backed student
loans and federal grants for their revenue. Their students receive about
one-quarter of all student loans and make up 43 percent of those who default on
such loans, according to the Department of Education. Some of the best- known
for-profit institutions are Capella, Kaplan and DeVry universities and the
University of Phoenix. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

STUDENT GRIEVANCES

For: 170/Against: 247

The House rejected the creation of a formal process by which students could file
grievances with state education officials against for-profit colleges and
universities. The process would give students a channel for venting complaints
over matters such as quality of instruction and financial aid disputes. The
bill's opponents said state accrediting agencies are already set up to hear such
complaints. As a result of this vote, the Department of Education's new rule
requiring state-by-state complaint procedures would be repealed as part of HR
2117 (above).

A yes vote backed the new rule for handling student complaints.

CALIFORNIA WATER DISPUTE

For: 246/Against: 175

The House sent the Senate a bill (HR 1837) that would override or weaken
California and federal laws and compacts for allocating San Joaquin River water
in the Central Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The bill would
direct more water to agricultural users in the Central Valley and less to the
benefit of farming in the delta and fishing, environmental and recreational
interests in other parts of California and in Oregon. The bill would override
the federal Central Valley Project Improvement Act and undercut the San Joaquin
River Settlement, a pact between environmentalists and farmers aimed at boosting
salmon populations in California and Oregon. The bill would extend the duration
of irrigation contracts from 25 to 40 years and reinstate a 1994 agreement, the
Bay-Delta Accord, which environmentalists and salmon-fishing interests have
since turned against. A yes vote was to pass the bill.

SENATE

HEALTH CARE AND RELIGION

For: 51/Against: 48

The Senate tabled (killed) an amendment enabling employers and insurance firms
to refuse to insure any medical procedure, item or device that conflicts with
their "religious beliefs and moral convictions." Although debate focused on
contraceptive care and women's health, both sides agreed the amendment was broad
enough to allow denials for any type of care, including preventive services,
specified as Essential Health Benefits in the 2010 Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act. Starting in 2014, those benefits must be covered by
Medicaid and by policies sold in the state insurance exchanges that form the
core of the 2010 health law.

The administration has exempted religious institutions from having to offer
services such as contraceptive care that would conflict with tenets of their
faith. Instead, insurance companies for these institutions must provide and pay
for theologically objectionable services. The administration says there will be
no cost to insurers because by covering preventive care, they will save money in
the long run. This amendment, which was offered to a pending transportation bill
(S 1813), went one step further by providing any employer or insurance firm the
same opt-out privilege the administration has granted to religious institutions.
A yes vote was to kill the amendment.

WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped back above 10,000 on hope
that a resolution was near for Greece's debt crisis. The Dow rose 150 points
Tuesday, a day after closing below 10,000 for the first time in three months.
The major indexes all gained more than 1 percent. Global markets bounced back on
reports that plans are being developed in the European Union to rescue Greece.
That raised hopes that policymakers will take bigger steps to contain debt
troubles in other weak European economies including Portugal and Spain.

COMMODITIES: Sugar and orange juice prices rose Tuesday after the Department of
Agriculture's latest report predicted smaller supplies of the crops than
previously estimated. Grains were little changed after the report, which showed
supplies for those commodities in line with expectations, said Frank Cholly Sr.,
a senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock. The USDA cut its forecast for the
2009-2010 orange harvest by 3 percent from last month's estimate. Freezing
temperatures in Florida in early January destroyed some of the crop.

With less supply of fresh fruit, the price of frozen orange juice concentrate
for March rose $3.40, or 3.4 percent, to settle at $1.3765. The price of March
sugar rose 0.47 cents to 27.07 cents a pound.

Wheat for March delivery fell 1.75 cents to settle at $4.825 a bushel. Soybeans
fell 5 cents to $9.245 a bushel. Corn rose 2.5 cents to $3.585 a bushel.

April gold rose $11 to settle at $1,077.20 an ounce. Silver for March delivery
rose 35 cents to settle at $15.435 an ounce. Copper jumped 7.4 cents to $2.987 a
pound.

WHOLESALE INVENTORIES: Businesses slashed wholesale inventories sharply in
December, a much weaker showing than expected and a troubling sign that
companies are still too pessimistic about the economy to begin restocking
shelves on a sustained basis. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that
wholesale inventories were reduced 0.8 percent in December.

AIRLINES

JAL sticks with American

Japan Airlines, wooed for months by Delta Air Lines with promises of cash and
global reach, spurned the world's biggest carrier and opted to keep its alliance
with American Airlines. The Japanese carrier said Tuesday it will strengthen its
partnership with American. The two airlines will jointly seek government
approval to work closer together to coordinate schedules on trans-Pacific
flights, share revenue and carry each other's passengers - all moves that can
boost profits.

The decision brings to an end a fierce tug-of-war over Japan's ailing flagship
carrier, which is restructuring under bankruptcy. The prize: JAL's Asian routes
and the premium passengers that come with them. For American, that means a
potentially bigger revenue stream, more power to help shape overseas customer
options and the potential to one day fly its own aircraft and passengers on
JAL's routes.

BRIEFLY

Larry Rambo, regional CEO of Humana, has been elected chairman of the Wisconsin
Health Information Organization , a collaborative group of insurers, hospitals,
physicians, major employers, health care quality organizations and government
agencies.

The Alliant Energy Foundation provided more than $2.9 million to support
community programs, services, scholarships and projects in 2009 in Iowa,
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The largest program, the community grants program,
awarded 575 grants totaling more than $973,000.

Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin has announced its officers for
2010. Those from the Madison area include Chuck Statton, Carroll Electric,
Janesville, past chairman.

'We're all about overcoming barriers'

LENGTH: 723  words

DATELINE: New York



 Chicago: American Dental Association has issued the following news release:



 In 1984, when Dr. Stephen Shuman was two years out of dental school, he began
working at a county health department in Illinois to provide dental care for
nursing home residents and developmentally disabled adults. But he'd never had
specific training in treating these patients.





 "I quickly realized how little I knew about caring for people with special
needs," he said. "Sometimes I didn't know where to begin."



 These days, Dr. Shuman's work as faculty director of the geriatrics program at
the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, in collaboration with the
Walker Methodist Health Center in Minneapolis, helps ensure that newly graduated
dental professionals are better equipped to care for patients with special
needs.



 In October, Shuman and the health center were recognized with the 2016
Innovation Award from LeadingAge, the national association of more than 6,000
nonprofits representing the entire field of aging services and dedicated to
expanding possibilities and advocacy for the aging.



 The health center was honored for enhancing access to oral health care for
older adults and for fostering geriatric education for university students.



 "To a large degree that's what drives me -- I don't want dental professionals
to be in the situation I was in when I came out of school, facing patients with
challenges I didn't understand and couldn't manage," Dr. Shuman said.



 The Walker Methodist Dental Clinic, located at Walker Methodist's Minneapolis
senior housing campus, opened its doors in 2006 in partnership with the
University  and with grant support from the Minnesota Department of Health.



 During its first year, the clinic served 337 patients. By 2016, it had served
2,300 patients while training more than 300 dental professionals in geriatric
care, according to Dr. Shuman.  The center accepts Medicaid, but also offers
unrestricted access to care.  Dr. Shuman said about $900,000 in uncompensated
dental care has been  provided since the clinic's opening. It is open to the
entire community, and it's a place that aims to be welcoming to everyone, he
said. Along with its specially trained staff, the clinic has resources such as
bigger dental operatories, airlift dental chairs, and mechanical lifts, among
other special features.



 The clinic not only provides hands-on training for University of Minnesota
students, but also opportunities for practicing professionals to continue their
education through the U-M School of Dentistry's Oral Health Services for Older
Adults Program.  For example, the school offers a 32-hour, intensive
mini-residency for dental professionals to learn how to provide better geriatric
care and serve in long-term care environments.



 "This training aspect of the clinic is key to improving oral health care for
the aging," Dr. Shuman said, acknowledging the challenges of caring for patients
with dementia, physical disabilities, on hospice care, and people with
complicated drug regimens or other significant medical issues.



 "We're all about overcoming barriers to care and it's important for students to
see what kind of strategies and tactics we have to help them treat these
patients effectively," he said.



 The clinic recently doubled its clinical and education capacity by adding two
new dental operatories (it now has four), along with lab, sterilization and
conference space to increase community access to comprehensive dental care for
the elderly and educational opportunities for students. The Minnesota Department
of Health, Delta Dental of Minnesota Foundation, Otto Bremer Trust of St. Paul
and Minneapolis' Stevens Square Foundation all contributed grants for the
expansion, in addition to support provided by Walker Methodist and the
university.



 On Oct. 31, the clinic, including Dr. Shuman, received its award from
LeadingAge at a ceremony in Indianapolis. In a story announcing the honorees,
LeadingAge magazine called the clinic's success "a clear example of how
collaboration, innovation and commitment to improving the quality of life for
older adults also advances the missions of the organizations involved and can
serve as a practical model for others."

Delaware: STATE READY TO GUIDE UNINSURED DELAWAREANS THROUGH ENROLLMENT ON THE
HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE BEGINNING OCT. 1

LENGTH: 1162  words

DATELINE: Dover


Delaware Health and Social Services, The State of Delaware has issued the
following news release:

Less than a month before Delaware's Health Insurance Marketplace opens for
enrollment, state officials and community organizations said they are ready to
begin the historic program to provide uninsured Delawareans greater access to
affordable health care.

Delaware Health and Social Services Secretary Rita Landgraf and Insurance
Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart were joined today at a kickoff event for the
marketplace by representatives of the four community organizations who will
guide individuals, families and small business owners through the enrollment
process. As part of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010, each state
must establish a marketplace - formerly known as an exchange - for individuals
who don't have access to affordable health insurance through work or some other
means. In addition, small business owners can shop for plans for their employees
through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). Enrollment for
individuals and small businesses will begin Oct. 1. Information about the
marketplace is available at www.ChooseHealthDE.com, the state's official
marketplace website, which is also available in Spanish.

"This is our collective opportunity to make affordable health insurance and
quality health care available to the 90,000 Delawareans who don't have insurance
today," Secretary Landgraf said at the kickoff event at the Latin American
Community Center in Wilmington. "With the help of the marketplace guides and our
marketing campaign, we will spread the word that Delaware's health insurance
marketplace will be open for enrollment beginning Oct. 1. For so many
individuals and families, this will mean the end to the fear that one accident
or one illness could send them into a lifetime of debt."

Commissioner Stewart said the 68 marketplace guides from Brandywine Women's
Health Associates, Christiana Care, the Delmarva Foundation and Westside Family
Healthcare are going through rigorous state and federal training, a proctored
exam, and state and federal background checks before they are certified by the
state to handle sensitive personal information.

"Delawareans will be able to trust the marketplace guides to help them through
enrollment because of the extensive certification process," Commissioner Stewart
said. "Each guide will have a badge with a certification number, and
identification from their community organization and from the state. Beginning
in the middle of this month, the guides will begin fanning out across the state
to help individuals and small businesses with enrollment, including the
possibility of tax credits to offset the costs."

Delawareans also will receive assistance from federal navigators, who will be
hired by Chatman LLC of Upper Marlboro, Md. Chatman LLC was awarded a federal
grant. In addition, Delaware's three federally qualified health centers,
Henrietta Johnson Medical Center, La Red Health Center and Westside Family
Healthcare, received federal grants to help with consumer assistance.
Commissioner Stewart said information on the rates for the plans on Delaware's
marketplace will be available before Oct. 1, after the federal government
concludes its approval process. Three issuers have applied to Delaware's
marketplace: Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, Coventry Health and
Life Insurance, and Coventry Health Care of Delaware. In addition, four
stand-alone dental plans have applied to Delaware's marketplace: Delta Dental,
Dentegra, Dominion and Guardian. Because Delaware opted for a state-federal
partnership marketplace, both the state and the federal government must approve
the plans.

Gia Cotman, who has been hired as a marketplace guide by Brandywine Women's
Health Associates, spoke about not having health insurance. Until recently,
Cotman said, she was receiving unemployment benefits and was not eligible for
coverage. She worried about the high cost of medical care if something happened
to her or her two children. "Having health insurance gives me peace of mind,"
Cotman said. "Going through that period makes me passionate about helping others
receive that same access to affordable health insurance."

Alex Parkowski, account supervisor for ab+c in Wilmington, which is designing
and executing the campaign's marketing communications, explained the strategy
behind the campaign. "The public awareness campaign is a multi-pronged approach
to help strengthen awareness of health insurance in general and the marketplace
in particular. The campaign is tailored toward two markets, 18- to 29-year-olds
and 30- to 64-year-olds, because they have vastly different expectations and
needs."
Choose Health Delaware encourages the younger audience to buy health insurance
because accidents and illnesses do happen, and the benefit of insurance far
outweighs the potential risk of not having insurance. For the older audience,
the message is that Delawareans can buy insurance through the marketplace
regardless of any pre-existing condition they might have.

The campaign includes radio, TV, print, billboards, social media and grassroots
outreach in places such as stores, barbershops, churches, libraries and
community centers. Many components of the campaign will be in English and
Spanish.

Delaware expects up to 35,000 people to enroll in the marketplace in the first
year. To receive coverage starting Jan. 1, 2014, people must enroll by Dec. 15,
2013. Open enrollment for the 2014 plan year continues through March 31, 2014.

In addition, the state expects up to 30,000 Delawareans to be eligible under the
Medicaid expansion that Gov. Markell approved last year. On Jan. 1, 2014,
Delaware's Medicaid income eligibility will move from 100 percent of the Federal
Poverty Level (FPL) to a maximum of 138 percent FPL.

President & CEO Maria Matos of the Latin American Community Center said it is
important that the marketplace reaches all Delawareans, including individuals
and small business owners who speak Spanish.

"I am so glad to hear that the marketplace guides will offer bilingual services,
" Matos said. "As a community organization, we know the importance of health
insurance and quality health care, and we will do our part to spread the message
about the marketplace throughout the state."

Secretary Landgraf said the federal government's 24/7 Call Center - (800)
318-2596 or TTY (855) 889-4325 - can answer questions in 150 languages. If
people don't have access to a computer, they can call the toll-free number to
get the help they need to enroll.

Thousands in rural Mississippi could continue to lack health insurance

Tens of thousands of uninsured residents in the poorest and most rural parts of
Mississippi may be unable to get subsidies to buy health coverage when a new
online marketplace opens this fall because private insurers are avoiding a wide
swath of the state.

No insurer is offering plans through the federal health law's marketplace in 36
of the state's 82 counties, including some of the poorest parts of the Delta
region, said Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney.

As a result, 54,000 people who may qualify for subsidized coverage would be
unable to get it, estimates the Center for Mississippi Health Policy, a
nonpartisan research group.

Many make a living picking soybeans or working on tree farms or in fast-food
restaurants, and earn too little to buy coverage on their own.

"That's the place where it's most needed," said Roy Mitchell, executive director
of the Mississippi Health Advocacy Program. "There's a high uninsured population
there. One of the highest infant mortality rates in the country is in that area
- a real lack of preventive care."

One of the goals of the health-care law was to provide coverage to people who
cannot afford coverage today. The gaps in Mississippi could undermine that
promise.

There is still some time: The federal government has extended a deadline and
allowed Mississippi to grant insurers several more weeks to file applications to
sell coverage, Chaney said. The marketplaces open for enrollment Oct. 1 for
individuals and small businesses.

Insurers declined to comment on the reasons they chose not to offer plans in
those counties. But Chaney and others said concerns include the difficulty of
creating networks of doctors and hospitals in rural areas, the poverty of the
region and uncertainty about the health law.

Insurers "have a tendency not to want to come to a poor state and the poorest
part of a poor state," said Stansel Harvey, chief executive of Delta Regional
Medical Center in Greenville, Miss.

Mississippi's marketplace will be overseen by the federal government, after
disagreement between Chaney and Gov. Phil Bryant (R), who opposed Chaney's plan
to create a state-run online market. Nationwide, 17 states will run their own
markets; the rest are operating marketplaces in conjunction with the federal
government or have defaulted to federal control.

Insurers Humana and Centene's Magnolia Health Plan will offer coverage in more
than half of the state's counties when the marketplace opens, according to data
from Chaney. But they aren't offering plans in other counties because they don't
have the needed networks of doctors and hospitals, Chaney said. He added that
"uncertainty about the law" led BlueCross BlueShield of Mississippi, which
currently sells in all parts of the state, not to seek approval for plans in the
new marketplace.

"There's a great concern about submitting plans to be approved on the federal
marketplace," Chaney said.

Obama administration spokeswoman Joanne Peters declined to address the situation
in Mississippi but said the government "is working hard to create competitive
marketplaces across the country."

She did not answer questions about whether other states were facing similar
problems.

Like hospital executives nationwide, Harvey was counting on expanded health
coverage under the Affordable Care Act to cover many of the poor, uninsured
patients who cost his 327-bed hospital millions each year in uncompensated care.
Little or no relief is expected from increased Medicaid coverage, either, he
noted, as a majority of state lawmakers appear opposed to expanding eligibility
for that program under the law.

"Where are these people going to get coverage?" Harvey asked.

Insurers now sell policies in all 36 counties - and are expected to continue to
do so next year - but only outside of the new marketplaces. Subsidies are
available only through the marketplaces, so those sold outside of it come with
no subsidy, and many residents are unlikely to purchase them without one.

"They are working in jobs that don't provide them with health coverage, and
their incomes are so low that they can't afford to buy regular coverage," said
Margaret Gray, chief executive of the Family Health Care Clinic, which serves
15,000 patients in the south and central parts of the state.

Animal-assisted therapy doggone effective

BYLINE: Jennifer Calhoun, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 779 words


Apr. 24--PINEHURST -- Just a few weeks ago, Freddie Cockerem couldn't walk at
all.

But on Thursday, he walked the dog.

Cockerem, a 70-year-old rehabilitation patient at FirstHealth Moore Regional
Hospital, was taking part in one of the hospital's newest programs --
animal-assisted therapy.

The program uses specially trained dogs to help patients strengthen their bodies
through seemingly simple exercises, such as walking the dog or brushing its
coat.

Cockerem's goal Thursday was to work on his balance. His partner in the job was
Abby, a 2 -year-old white Labrador retriever owned and managed by volunteer
Kathy Constantino.

"Come on Abby," Cockerem said, leaning on his walker and holding Abby's leash.
"Come here, baby. You doin' all right."

It was the first time Cockerem, who was recovering from spinal surgery, had
worked with a dog, he said.

"I thought it would be a good experience," he said. "I got a dog at home, but he
don't take to walkin' on a leash."

But Abby is no ordinary dog.

Not anymore, at least. Abby, and Constantino's other dog, Tess, are certified
with the Delta Society, an organization that registers and trains people and
pets to administer rehabilitative services.

The hospital is one of two in the state with a certified animal-assisted therapy
program, where dogs actually take an active part in the patients' physical
rehabilitation.

And while some health care facilities have volunteers who bring in dogs for
emotional comfort, Moore Regional has taken it a step further, said Amber Parke
Chalker, an occupational therapist at the hospital.

The Delta Society-registered dogs help patients perform therapeutic exercises --
something other volunteer dogs aren't registered for.

Granted, many of the exercises are things the dogs like -- such as chasing balls
and being brushed and petted -- but the dogs still have to pass skills and
aptitude tests to qualify for certification.

Parke Chalker started the program after moving here from Washington, D.C., where
she worked at a larger hospital that provided the service.

The majority of her patients were substance abusers and suffered from traumatic
injuries, such as gunshot wounds, stabbings and other "really tough stuff," she
said.

As a result, many patients were uncooperative or unwilling to perform the
rehabilitative exercises the therapists recommended.

But when the dogs came in, everything changed, Parke Chalker said.

Patients who otherwise wouldn't lift their hand to help themselves would reach
out to pet the dogs -- a simple exercise that could put a patient on the road to
recovery.

"It's the connection," Parke Chalker said. "Dogs don't judge. They just love
you, and people know that. I saw it again and again."

After moving here in May, Parke Chalker applied for and received a $3,500 grant
from the FirstHealth Foundation to implement the program.

Although it's only been up and running for a couple of months, Parke Chalker
said she's already noticed changes in some of the patients.

One patient -- a man who hadn't walked more than 10 feet in his previous therapy
sessions -- walked three times as much when he was with the dog, Parke Chalker
said.

"The cool thing is, people won't remember where they are or what day it is, but
they'll remember the dog's name," she said. "They'll be consistent with nothing
else but these animals."

The dogs, which come every Thursday and Friday, also bring a smile to patients
and staff, regardless of whether they work with them, Parke Chalker said.

"They light up," she said.

It's something Cockerem can understand. He has a dog at home, and he hopes to
get another, smaller one when he gets back -- preferably one that could fetch
him a ham from the fridge, he joked.

In fact, Cockerem thinks there's only one thing that's keeping dogs from being
the perfect companion: Speech.

"A dog is a very good animal," Cockerem said, with a twinkle in his eye. "But I
wish we could teach dogs to talk. If you could get a dog to talk, he could tell
you a lot of things. He'd probably tell you where he's been, what he's seen. He
might even tell on himself."

Study shows drug reduces seizures A new drug is offering hope to families with
the most severe type of childhood epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved clobazam after research
showed it reduced the number of seizures. Clinical trials were led by Yu-Tze Ng,
a pediatric neurologist with OU Children's Physicians and the Presbyterian
Health Foundation Chair of Child Neurology at the University of Oklahoma College
of Medicine.

The recent phase III clinical trial, involving more than 200 pediatric and adult
patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome at 51 health centers in the United States,
India, Europe and Australia, found the drug reduced seizures in 70 percent of
patients taking a dosage of one milligram per day. Lower doses also saw reduced
seizures, but to a lesser degree.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe childhood epilepsy associated with several
types of seizures, including dangerous drop seizures that can cause falls and
injury. Onset usually occurs before 8 years of age.

"This medication seems to be very effective for reduction of seizures in a form
of epilepsy that's very hard to treat," said Ng, who is also director of
epilepsy for OU Children's Physicians. Ng authored a paper about the drug study
that is published in the journal Neurology.

The trial was funded by Lundbeck Inc. Clobazam has been in development in the
United States since 2005.

Norman Regional program accredited The cancer program at Norman Regional
Hospital has been awarded three-year accreditation by the Commission on Cancer
of the American College of Surgeons.

Established in 1922 by the American College of Surgeons, the Commission on
Cancer is a consortium of professional organizations dedicated to improving
survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.

Cancer researcher awarded grant Researchers at the Peggy and Charles Stephenson
Cancer Center have been awarded a $1.9 million grant from the National Cancer
Institute.

Michael Ihnat and Robert Hurst were awarded the grant to better understand why
some cancers come back and to develop more effective strategies to target
recurrent and metastatic cancers.

"There are no drugs out there that treat metastasis and ultimately metastasis
kills patients," said Ihnat, a member of the Cancer Center's Experimental
Therapeutics Research Program and associate professor at the OU College of
Pharmacy.

Ihnat has collaborated in research and business with Hurst, a member of the
Cancer Center's Basic Cancer Biology Research program, professor of Urology and
adjunct professor in the OU College of Medicine's Department of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology. The two hope focus on new treatments that can ensure that
patients who beat cancer once won't have to battle that same cancer again.

Ihnat and Hurst have developed a laboratory model for recurrent cancer. They
plan to use that model to better understand the mechanisms that trigger
recurrence.

Ihnat and Hurst believe the key to success lies in cutting off the supply of
dormant cells before they can reach their target.

The NCI-funded research is a collaborative effort between the OUHSC and
DormaTarg, the company created by Ihnat and Hurst in partnership with the
university.

Integris buys Plaza Medical Group Integris Health has purchased Plaza Medical

Fitch Rates Delta State Univ Educational Bldg Corp (MS) Rev Rfdg Bonds Ser 2016
'AA'; Outlook Stable

LENGTH: 1159 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Chicago: Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA' rating to the following bonds
issued by the D.S.U. Educational Building Corporation, MS (EBC) on behalf of
Delta State University:



 --Approximately $15.57 million revenue refunding bonds, series 2016 (Delta
State University [DSM]) facilities refinancing project).





 The bonds are expected to price via negotiation the week of Feb. 28. Series
2016 bond proceeds will refund or defease all or part of the D.S.U. Educational
Building Corporation's series 2003 campus facilities bonds and the Mississippi
Business Finance Corporation's series 2009A revenue bonds, and pay issuance
expenses.



 The Rating Outlook is Stable.



 SECURITY



 EBC bonds are payable from designated revenues of the eight academic
institutions overseen by the Mississippi State Institutions of Higher Learning
(IHL), pursuant to a lease agreement. Designated revenues include net tuition,
fees, and auxiliary revenues; sales and services; other operating revenues;
state operating appropriations; and unrestricted net assets. IHL's obligation
under the lease is absolute and unconditional. There is no debt service reserve
fund for the series 2016 bonds.



 KEY RATING DRIVERS



 SOUND SYSTEM FINANCIAL OPERATIONS: The 'AA' rating reflects IHL's sound and
stable financial profile, as evidenced by consistently breakeven-to-positive
GAAP-based operating performance, a satisfactory level of available funds
relative to operating expenses and debt, a diverse revenue base, and state
operating and capital support (state of Mississippi rated 'AA+'/Stable Outlook).




 INTEGRAL STATE EDUCATION ROLE: The eight IHL member institutions benefit from
their role of providing all four-year public higher education and research
services in the state. Additionally, the University of Mississippi Medical
Center (UMMC) is a major healthcare provider.



 MANAGEABLE DEBT BURDEN: The system's manageable pro forma maximum annual debt
service (MADS) burden is a moderate 3.8% of fiscal 2015 unrestricted operating
revenues. Net operating income regularly provides solid pro forma MADS coverage
averaging more than 2.0x since fiscal 2010, including 2.4x based on fiscal 2015
operations. Ongoing capital plans for member institutions appear manageable.



 RATING SENSITIVITIES



 WEAKENED FINANCIAL PROFILE: Material erosion in Mississippi State Institutions
of Higher Learning (IHL) system-wide operating performance or balance sheet
ratios, which is not anticipated at this time, could pressure the rating. IHL
benefits from relatively system-wide stable enrollment and a prominent
state-wide education role.



 CREDIT PROFILE



 Founded in 1944, IHL governs the state's eight four-year higher education
institutions: Alcorn State University, Delta State University, Jackson State
University, Mississippi State University (MSU), Mississippi University for
Women, Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU), University of Mississippi
(UM), and University of Southern Mississippi (USM). It also includes UMMC, which
is part of UM.



 Fitch views the system's historical stability as providing some flexibility to
manage enrollment and demographic cycles. Rapid system enrollment growth since
2008 has leveled off in recent years due to lower community college enrollment
and fewer transfer students, as well as flat to declining numbers of high school
graduates in Mississippi. Fitch expects IHL to manage effectively through the
system's periodic enrollment cycles.



 Headcount for fall 2015 for all IHL member institutions was 81,024, up 1.7%
from 79,704 in fall 2014. IHL projects generally stable enrollment in the next
several years, supported by continued out-of-state recruitment (about 27% of
system headcount is from out of state, principally at UM and MSU), and growth in
online learning.



 UM is IHL's largest member institution (about 23,838 headcount in fall 2015,
about 29% of the IHL system), followed by MSU (about 20,873 or 26%) and USM
(about 14,551 or 18%). Preliminary enrollment for the other five members ranged
from 2,309 to 9,802. The UM Medical Center receives state funding independently,
but is part of UM. Of the eight system institutions, UM has realized the most
enrollment growth in recent years, up nearly 22% between fall 2010 and 2015.



 DSU is located in northwest Mississippi, on a campus surrounded by the City of
Cleveland. Established as a state teachers college, its first students started
in 1925. DSU's students are a mix of residential and commuter. Headcount
enrollment for fall 2015 was 3,460, which is down from about 3,523 in fall 2013
(DSU numbers exclude Teach-For-America students). Undergraduate programs include
nursing, education, and criminal justice, and the growing Delta Music Institute.
Graduate programs include business, accounting, commercial aviation, education
and nursing.



 SOUND SYSTEM OPERATIONS



 IHL's balanced operating performance supports the 'AA' rating. IHL consistently
generates breakeven-to-positive GAAP-based operating results, including 3.6% in
fiscal 2015. The system has managed effectively through several years (fiscals
2010-2013) during declines in state operating appropriations and federal grants
and contracts.



 Positively, state appropriations for the entire system increased by 3.4% in
fiscal 2016, 3.35% in fiscal 2015, and 5.74% in fiscal 2014. Fitch views IHL as
having good revenue diversity. In fiscal 2015, operating revenues included
operating appropriations (22%), healthcare operations (31%), grants and
contracts (11.8%, including federal scholarship programs); and student/auxiliary
fees (24%). This revenue mix is not expected to change materially.



 ADEQUATE SYSTEM BALANCE SHEET



 The system's balance sheet ratios remain consistent with the 'AA' rating
category. Available funds (AF), defined by Fitch as cash and investments less
certain restricted net assets, totaled $1.37 billion at June 30, 2015. AF
represented an adequate 43% of operating expenses and a stronger 91% of pro
forma debt (about $1.5 billion).



 Fitch's AF calculation excludes endowment held in separate foundations. At the
end of fiscal 2015, foundation net assets benefiting UM, MSU and USM totaled $1
billion, of which the majority was restricted.



 MANAGEABLE SYSTEM DEBT BURDEN



 System debt in October 2015 was about $1.5 billion, including bonds, notes,
non-cancellable operating leases, and capital leases. MADS of approximately $125
million represented a moderate 3.8% of fiscal 2015 operating revenues.



 The system's debt portfolio is conservatively structured, with front-loaded
amortization and mostly fixed-rate debt. Institutional MADS coverage is
regularly around 2x, a solid level. Pro forma MADS is 2.4x based on fiscal 2015
operations. Future debt plans appear manageable.

State Institutions of Higher Learning, S.M. Educational Building Corporation
(University of Southern Mississippi) Series 2016, dated Jan. 14, 2016.

Delta Didn't Get a Fair Deal Under Uduaghan - Ovie Omo-Agege [interview]

LENGTH: 1678  words


On January 6, Deltans will go for a fresh election to choose a governor. In this
interview with Vanguard,

, the Republican Party of Nigeria candidate speaks on his mission and vision for
the people.

My vision is that of a viable Delta State where excellence is rewarded, and the
well-being of Deltans is guaranteed, where cherished values are protected. Delta
State is blessed in terms of human and material resources. But when you come
into the state, you ask yourselves, with all of these endowments, how come there
is nothing to show for it? We saw that Edo State was going down the drains
before the emergence of Oshiomhole as governor.

But see what has happened since he became governor with little or no resources
that can match what Delta State receives from the federation account.

Our people did not get a fair deal from the government of Uduaghan when you
compare it with what the government has received. So, for that reason, we are
coming in with an agenda which we have christened 'the five steps to
prosperity.' We want to provide free and functional education to our people at
primary and secondary school levels.

We intend to take it all the way to university level by way of bursary awards
and scholarships. In addition, we want to create an enabling environment for
students to study properly. We intend to set up two model schools per local
government area across the state. We intend to enhance the packages of teachers
so that there will be the need for them to want to stay in the rural areas,
instead of coming upland.

Are they not Deltans? Why the segregation and abandonment of those from five
years to 65 years in the health care system? Why is the vibrant section of the
population, the active tax-paying group being discriminated against? It is
unfair to collect their taxes and deny them the benefits of governance.

I am making a case that the active population are equally qualified; they are
the pillars of economic growth and development. Look in spite of the money that
has been voted for the health sector, from the time when this ex-governor was
the Commissioner for Health, there has been no improvement in that sector. In
fact, the health sector under Dr. Uduagahan, has been sick and dying,
incrementally.

The General Hospital, on Okpanam Road, has been abandoned. We intend to renovate
all the existing hospitals and put them under proper management. Our programme
in health is designed to ensure that what we call free medicare is free and
quality medical services.

From here, we go to urban renewal programme. Under the programme, we are looking
at constructing a coastal road from the River Niger Bridge- head, to terminate
at Anwai River, to create an alternative to Nnebisi road as the only route in
and out of Asaba. Once the coastal road is constructed, you can imagine the
commercial and tourist activities that will spring up on that road. We are also
looking at what it will cost to dualise Nnebisi Road, add drainage and proper
road shoulders and street lights, etc.

As part of our urban renewal, we want to do a new town development, we are
looking forward to acquiring lands to build housing estates. We want to do this
by going into private-public partnership with investors, government will provide
the sites and services and, in return, the private investors will build the
houses. We are looking forward to strengthening the Delta Building Society to
enable them provide funds for civil servant and Deltans to acquire the houses.

In Ogwashi-Uku, we intend to build a dam at the Ubu River for agricultural
irrigation, water supply, and electricity generation by including a 50 mega
watts turbine. We are also looking at integrated agricultural development. What
we intend to do here is basically to assist our farmers to go into
mechanised/commercial farming. We intend to set up equipment leasing agencies in
all the local government areas where farmers could lease farming equipment that
will be purchased by government at little cost, to assist them expand their
development of agriculture.

Another component of the five steps to prosperity is security of life and
property, which will be anchored on community policing. Another area is manpower
development which is the creation of jobs and employment for our teeming youths.
We are also looking at the situation where some of our industries in the state
that have gone moribund like Delta Glass, AT & P, Asaba Textile Mill, can be
brought back to life under the PPP arrangement to create businesses and jobs for
our youths who are unemployed.

It is our plan to set up an Economic Reconstruction Fund whose aim shall be to
partner with private investors to revive some of our ailing industries as well
as establish new ones on joint venture basis. This is to enable us provide some
form of funding, or to provide some kind of guarantee for the loans that will be
given, to revitalise the ailing industries. Our goal is to create the job
opportunities and produce goods and services.

Personally, I don't believe in rotation or zoning because it breeds mediocrity,
but, having said that, I believe in equity, I believe in fairness. Some of us
are in this race today because there is nobody from the Delta North Senatorial
District who has shown interest.

If there is a candidate from Delta North who has shown interest, I will support
him or her because, since everybody is complaining about Dr. Uduaghan's poor
performance, most of us would have thrown our support behind that candidate.

I am in this race because there is no one from Delta North and the popular
feeling today is the governor should be anybody but Uduaghan. That is why I am
putting myself forward. Now, having said that, the people from Delta North have
an aspiration to govern in 2015, I do not quarrel with that aspiration, and I
have made my commitment to them that I will do a single term of four years. In
2015, I will assist in ensuring that that aspiration comes to pass, I have a
clear-cut strategy to make them attain that aspiration.

Well, I served the people of Delta. I happened to have served under Chief James
Ibori as a Deltan. I served as an Executive Assistant, I served as Commissioner
for Special Duties, I served as Secretary to the State Government. I believe
that in all of these capacities I acquainted myself creditably. I have listed
the accomplishments I brought to my people during this period; I made positive
impact with that opportunity, which is very important in politics.

But, above all, I don't think anybody should be deprived of service to his state
just because he served in the James Ibori's administration unless there is
verifiable evidence to prove that the person soiled his hands.

Well, for some of us, many people in Delta believe that his administration
failed. We believe that the people of Delta deserved much more than they
received from his administration, this is not personal. I don't have anything
personal against Uduaghan, but I just believe that Uduaghan is not good for the
people of Delta.

Uduaghan has had three and a half years, albeit illegally and his record is
there. I can tell you that for three and a half years, he did not add value to
the state. All the projects the former governor has commissioned were those
commenced and paid for by Chief Ibori, before he left office. Except setting up
diesel-powered street lights and putting television viewing centres in
roundabouts and dangerous street intersection in the state, you cannot point to
one single thing that the former governor has done with N650 billion that he has
received in three and a half years.

We are, therefore, saying that we have had enough of bad governance, which is
what all this is all about. It is not a personal battle, the entire Delta State
is waiting for the opportunity to shame the rigging machine of PDP .

Well, so many people say that the Republican Party is not known in the state and
it does not have the structure, is that not an impediment?

This election is not so much about the platform, it's about what you have to
offer to the people and I believe that I have so much to offer. As contained in
my manifesto christened 'the five steps to posterity,' the question is whether
or not the people of Delta want these policies to be implemented for their own
good. If they want it, they can vote for me, if they don't, they have their
choice, that's what democracy is all about, it is about freedom of choice. DPP
has its candidate, PDP has its, it is not so much about the platform but about
what we have to offer.

With God on my side, I will emerge the governor of Delta State.

There are fears that your presence will split the vote of Delta Central and that
you are not the consensus of the Delta Central Senatorial District.

All that I can tell you is that I am not running this election as an ethnic
irredentist or an ethnic champion. I regard every Nigerian and indeed, every
Deltan as my brother or sister. In every social group, be it family, race, tribe
or gender, we have good people and bad people; so I do not discriminate against
people based on primordial sentiments.

Having said that, I want to say that my support base cuts across the different
ethnic groups in the state. I entered this race confident that I will win,
irrespective of the number of people contesting. There will always be a split of
votes in any event.

Even in Delta Central, for instance, there are people who will vote PDP, others
will vote Labour Party, there are others who will vote ANPP and other parties
contesting the election, the question is whether one is able to muster the
majority of the votes in the election to get 25 per cent across the 25 local
government areas and have a majority of the aggregate votes across the three
senatorial districts and still be able to muster 25 per cent in at least
two-third of the states which comes to 16 local government areas but I am
confident that I can garner a minimum of 25 per cent in all the local government
areas and get the majority of the votes cast in the ballot. With God on my side,
I will emerge the governor of Delta State.

Kaiser donates $2.4 million to shore up rural care in Colorado

BYLINE: Amy Gillentine

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 408  words


Colorado's rural areas are facing a serious shortage of health care providers -
but Kaiser Permanente is giving $2.4 million to the University of Colorado at
Denver's Health Science Center to help train more medical professionals who will
work in isolated areas the state.

The money will establish an Interdisciplinary Rural Training and Service
Program, designed to be part of the schools of medicine, dental medicine and
pharmacy. Students will practice together and train together - coordinating
patient care in a way that they might do in rural areas.

The goal is to apply an integrated training approach to enhance care in Delta,
Garfield, Routt, Jackson and other rural counties.

Seven counties in Colorado have no dentists, six have no full-time primary care
doctors and one has no primary care doctor.

The effort is one of several.

C.U. Denver created a rural track four years ago to increase the number of
students who practice in rural areas. The school of pharmacy places students in
full-time internships throughout the state, and the dental school provides
mobile services to Colorado's remote areas.

Kaiser's effort is different because it trains people in integrated medicine,
said Dr. Jandel Allen-Davis, vice president of government and rural affairs for
Kaiser.

The Colorado Rural Health Center also is dedicated to increasing the number of
medical professionals throughout the state.

The group administers several scholarships and outreach programs to encourage
medical students to consider practicing in areas without doctors, dentists and
pharmacists. The programs are funded by The Colorado Trust, the Boettcher
Foundation, the Colorado Medical Society and COPIC.

In addition, the group offers online recruitment to match practitioners with
counties that need them.

The Colorado Health Foundation spends $2 million annually for its physician loan
repayment program, a five-year, $6 million program to bolster Colorado's doctor
work force.

And the Colorado Trust offers funding not only for training health care
professionals, but also to help move current doctors into rural areas.

"It's a mixed strategy," said Christie McElhenney, spokeswoman for the group.
"Providing funding for education is a long-term proposition. So we also work on
supplemental means to get health care to people. We provide support for mobile
health vans and school-based health centers. "

Amy Gillentine covers health care for the Colorado Springs Business Journal.

* * * * * * * * * * DESCRIPTION * * * * * * * * * *


   The Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority (FDHA) is a volunteer board that governs
the Grady Health System in Atlanta. The Grady Health System operates the Grady
Memorial Hospital (an acute-care, 950-bed medical facility), primary and
specialty care centers, and a network of community health centers in the Atlanta
metro area. The Grady Memorial Hospital is the teaching hospital for the medical
schools of Emory University and Morehouse College . The Fulton and DeKalb county
commissioner boards appoint the FDHA board members. Not-for-profit Grady
Memorial Hospital Corporation (GMHC) manages the daily activities of the Grady
Health System.

   Operations

   In addition to the Grady Health System, the FDHA also provides grants to more
than 50 not-for-profit community organizations that provide free or low-cost
healthcare services and screenings in Fulton and DeKalb counties.

   In 2012, in response to the growing mental health service needs in
metropolitan Atlanta, Grady Health System centralized and relocated its
outpatient mental health programs. Grady combined three outpatient behavioral
health offices into a one large location to better serve the residents of
metropolitan Atlanta.

   In 2011 Grady Health System completed its $325 million Greater Grady capital
campaign. It opened new $7 million Marcus Trauma Center to handle the most
seriously injured patients and opened a new $1 million Walk-In Center to direct
non-emergency patients to appropriate care and alleviate congestion in its
emergency department.

   Strategy

   In 2011 Grady Health System made operational changes in order to continue
providing quality health services with fewer dollars. Since 2007 Grady has
improved efficiencies, resulting in increased revenue and lower expenses across
the health system. But over those four years, Grady's federal and county funding
has been reduced by nearly $50 million while its indigent care costs have gone
up by more than $40 million.

   The hospital authority is working with the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce
to address Grady Health System's financial difficulties (resulting from a large
level of uninsured and Medicaid/Medicare patients).

   While considering funding options for the health system, the FDHA decided to
hand over daily management of the health system to a non-profit corporation;
GMHC was formed for that purpose and took over management duties through a lease
and transfer agreement in early 2008.

   The hospital system has received $200 million in funding from the Robert W.
Woodruff Foundation when the management shift took place, and it has since
received smaller donations from the likes of Kaiser Permanente and Delta Air
Lines . The management corporation is seeking funding from additional public and
private entities. The FDHA continues to own Grady Health System's buildings and
land.

   Company Background

   The Grady Health System was founded in 1892. FDHA came into existence in
1941, but assuming control of Grady was delayed until 1946 due to WWII.

City anti-poverty agency may oust board president

BYLINE: Eric Eyre, Staff writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P1A

LENGTH: 919 words


A Charleston-based anti-poverty agency plans to vote today whether to oust board
President Margo Brooks amid allegations she tried to use her position to secure
federal grant money for a Mississippi-based nonprofit, where Brooks works as a
contract administrator.

Brooks, who serves as president of Capital Resource Agency and an administrator
at Taborian Urgent Care Center in Mound Bayou, Miss., has said she did nothing
wrong. She has accused CRA Executive Director Danny Scalise of
"insubordination," "distorting facts" and "creating a hostile environment" at
the agency.

Three weeks ago, Scalise asked Brooks to resign. She refused. Scalise is now
recommending that agency's board vote to remove Brooks.

"My job is to run a good, clean operation," Scalise said Wednesday. "I don't
want another investigation."

Two years ago, the state seized control of CRA's weatherization program after
investigators discovered widespread fraud. The allegations against Brooks have
again plunged Capital Resource Agency into turmoil and thwarted Scalise's recent
efforts to restore the nonprofit's credibility.

Last month, Scalise sent a letter to agency board members, alleging Brooks had a
conflict of interest because of her twin roles as CRA's president and as an
administrator at the Mississippi Delta-region's urgent care health center.

Earlier this year, Capital Resource Agency applied for a $25 million federal
grant. Brooks wanted her Mississippi employer to administer the grant, according
to Scalise's letter.

"In effect, she would get paid to administer the grant," Scalise wrote to board
members. "She has acted without authority and is attempting to mix her paid
responsibilities in Mississippi with CRA, which is a direct violation of the
West Virginia code and CRA's bylaws that state that a board member may not
receive compensation due to her actions as a member of this board."

As part of President Obama's new health care law, the federal government plans
to distribute $1 billion to hospitals, nonprofits and local government agencies
that start innovative health programs for people on Medicare and Medicaid. Grant
recipients will be announced on March 30.

Capital Resource Agency hopes to use the $25 million to establish health-care
clinics at community centers, churches and other sites in 10 West Virginia
counties. Grant partners include the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department and
community action groups in Logan and Lincoln counties.

In January, Brooks asked Capital Resource Agency to merge its grant application
with Taborian Urgent Care, Scalise said.

The Mississippi group is restoring the former Taborian Hospital, the nation's
first hospital owned and operated by African-Americans. The hospital, which
closed in 1983, served only black patients.

Scalise and other directors of other anti-poverty groups that signed on to CRA's
grant application weren't interested in teaming up with a Mississippi-based
nonprofit.

"Margo Brooks was trying to change the direction of the grant by directing it
towards a partnership with Mississippi," wrote Dwight Coburn, executive director
of the Southwestern Community Action Council of West Virginia, in a Feb. 14
email to Scalise. "It appears she may be acting on behalf of Mississippi, not on
behalf of your agency and our partnership."

At last month's board meeting, Capital Resource Agency board members said the
$25 million grant "should not have any involvement with anything going on in
Mississippi."

"It didn't feel right with any of us," Scalise said Wednesday. "We want to help
West Virginians."

At the meeting, Brooks said she also worked for the city of Mound Bayou, Miss.,
which was founded as an independent black community by former slaves. It
currently has a 98.4 percent African-American population.

A day after Scalise sent his letter to CRA board members, Brooks sent them an
email, saying, "Mr. Scalise is insubordinate."

Five days later, Brooks wrote a scathing 10-page response to Scalise.

In the letter, she alleged that a grant writer contracted through Cisco Systems
had recommended that her Mississippi-based employer join Capital Resource
Agency's application for the $25 million federal grant.

"It was not my suggestion or recommendation to combine the two applications,"
Brooks wrote to fellow board members. "Obviously, Mr. Scalise is grasping at
straws to impugn my integrity, a very serious offense for an executive director
to take against a board member."

Brooks went on to call Scalise's allegations "vicious, unethical and perhaps
even illegal."

"It's not just a distortion, but rather a total fabrication," she wrote.

Brooks said Scalise didn't want to "lose control" of the grant. She accused him
of being "hostile," and said he was "screaming" during a recent telephone
conference call.

"Never in my 40 years of involvement with nonprofit boards have I ever seen such
unconscionable actions by an executive director ... " Brooks wrote in her
letter.

Brooks, a Fayette County native, formerly worked for an anti-poverty agency in
Chicago.

She returned to Fayette County in 2007 and established a group called SELF
Community Action Corp. The organization operated out of her home. SELF lost its
tax-exempt status and is now defunct.

Brooks did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment Wednesday.

The Capital Resource Agency board plans to meet at 5 p.m. today at the
Schoenbaum Family Enrichment Center in Charleston.

The agency formerly was headquartered in South Charleston.

Clinic becomes a part of Hartsfield

BYLINE: KIRSTEN TAGAMI

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Business; Pg. 1F

LENGTH: 517 words


When Thomas Joseph hurt his back lifting heavy luggage, he didn't have to go far
for medical care.

The 37-year-old baggage handler for Delta Air Lines walked over to a clinic in
the main terminal at Hartsfield International Airport, where a physical
therapist massaged his lower back and showed him some exercises to reduce future
strain.

The terminal's new R.L. Brown Health Center --- a first for the Atlanta airport
--- specializes in occupational injuries and work-related medical exams such as
drug screenings and hearing and vision tests to recertify pilots.

It also offers routine care to the people who work at Hartsfield and treats
passengers needing urgent care.

That might be anything from a traveler who left her blood pressure medication at
home to someone suffering from food poisoning after a foreign trip.

The clinic is a joint venture of Caduceus Occupational Medicine, a physician
group, and Grady Health System, which operates Grady Memorial Hospital, the
state's largest charity hospital.

It is the first for-profit venture for Grady, which has struggled for years to
fund its budget.

Caduceus has eight other clinics, including one in Atlanta's Ford Motor Co.
assembly plant.

In the three months since it opened, the Hartsfield clinic has treated fast-food
workers burned on the job, travelers who twisted their ankles falling off
escalators, dozens of workers with back ailments and a variety of other
airport-related medical needs.

The clinic will be open every day of the year, including Christmas.

"It's an advantage for people who work at the airport," Joseph said.

It also benefits employers because workers can return to the job faster, said
Dr. Stephen Dawkins, an occupational medicine physician at the clinic.

There are about a dozen airport-based clinics in the United States, including
ones in Boston, Minneapolis and Newark, N.J., that have been around for more
than 30 years.

One of the biggest is in Los Angeles International Airport, where about 200
people are treated each day, Dawkins said. The clinic at San Francisco
International Airport, which has been treating travelers for nearly three
decades, recently expanded to offer primary care for airport workers.

Grady began talking about opening the clinic several years ago as part of an
overall push to expand into the private sector and become self-supporting, said
manager Elsie Stevens. Grady leases the space from Hartsfield.

The health system plans to use profits from the clinic to "help us with our
budget problems," she said. Officials declined to say how much revenue they
expect from the clinic or how it will be used.

Grady's mission to provide health care to the poor hasn't changed, but "to meet
that mission we must create new revenue streams," said President and Chief
Executive Officer Edward Renford.

Grady is supported by the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, state and federal
funding, patient payments and grants.

Besides the Hartsfield clinic, Grady has nine "neighborhood" nonprofit clinics,
including one in a Kroger in south DeKalb County.

Nuns Bring Hope to a Destitute Town in Mississippi

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 1335 words

DATELINE: JONESTOWN, Miss.


With the harvest nearly over, bits of cotton residue scatter over the roads. The
smell of frying chicken drenches Main Street. Men without jobs dig under the
hoods of old Pontiacs, trying to make them run again. The scene here could be
from any of the mostly black, mostly destitute towns at the core of the
Mississippi Delta.

Except for the gray-haired woman in a sweatshirt and jeans, coaching teenage
boys in a game of flag football. The woman, Kay Burton, is white, robust as the
Idaho farmers she grew up among, and a Roman Catholic nun.

Sister Kay, 65, a member of the Holy Name order, is one of four nuns from
faraway states who live and work in Jonestown, a community of 44 whites and
1,660 blacks 50 miles south of Memphis.

In the 1980's, a half dozen orders of Catholic nuns looked around the country to
see where they could be most helpful, and they began sending members into the
Delta, with the support of the Diocese of Jackson, Miss. Since then, several
hundred nuns have settled in communities like Tutwiler, Tunica, Marks, Rosedale
and Jonestown -- places that whites had deserted with the desegregation of
schools.

With little fanfare and no government help to speak of, these sisters help
reinforce the town's crowded and underfinanced public schools. They are also
nurses, doctors, counselors and community organizers. They build medical
clinics, nonsectarian preschools for the youngest children and houses with
Habitat for Humanity volunteers.

They provide the towns' only refuges for many children to do homework or make
decorations for Halloween. They organize programs for teenage girls as
alternatives to becoming pregnant.

Using church and private donations -- nothing from government agencies -- they
have opened a new brick Community Education Center in Tutwiler with a big
gymnasium. In Jonestown this year, they opened a Montessori school for children
ages 2 to 6.

People say the sisters keep their towns afloat in the face of the Delta's
intractable poverty. Lavorn Burnett, 51, and her husband, Donal, 52, own a
service station next to Jonestown's cramped City Hall. They use the health
clinic of Manette Durand, 60-ish, a member of the Sisters of St. Joseph of
Carondelet.

A nurse practitioner, Sister Manette is the only health care provider in town.
"She can do everything but cutting," Mrs. Burnett said. "She takes time to talk
to you. You can call her if you're having a problem. You can talk to her like
friends. She gives you the advice you need to make a decision.

"And Sister Kay, Sister Kay has this carpentry class. She teaches the kids
through working. One kid built a porch for his house. I don't want you to think
I'm glorifying the nuns. It's just what we've seen here."

Judy Phillips, manager of a community preservation program at Mississippi State
University that oversees a grant to renovate a long-abandoned school, said, "I
can't think of any entity that is more important to Jonestown than the sisters."

More than local churches, businesses or government agencies, Ms. Phillips said,
"they are the true support net within that community."

Viewed by the usual measures of community health, Jonestown sits on the floor of
the nation's cellar. The 2000 census deemed half its families poor, compared
with 9 percent nationwide. The median family income was $15,750, nearly $27,000
less than the national median.

In communities with 1,000 or more people, Jonestown had the second-highest rate
of single-mother households, 32 percent, after Ford Heights, Ill., near Chicago.
The median age of single mothers here was 21. The national median was 35.

More than half of the adults in town do not work, the census found. One reason
is education. Fewer than half the adults over 25 have high school diplomas.
Another reason is transportation. Almost one in three households do not have a
car. There is no public transportation.

"Some of our folks have never had decent shoes on, so they have impaired feet,"
Sister Manette said.

She trims corns and nails and bathes patients' feet in a whirlpool. She treats
many knife and gunshot wounds, too, and the chronic diseases of the poor, like
hypertension, diabetes and osteoarthritis.

However bleak, the statistics obscure crosscurrents of pride and resilience. "We
don't have any suicides," Sister Manette said.

After falling for years, the population has grown 38 percent in the last 20
years. Jonestown's cottonseed oil mill has survived the many mill closings in
other Delta towns. New jobs have opened in the casinos of Tunica County, 35
miles away, to which young mothers here commute on casino-financed buses.

The gauges of poverty apply to the Burnetts in some ways but not in others. They
are qualified for food stamps and welfare but never applied. They economized
with chicken, they said. They reared their five children in a three-bedroom
trailer behind their service station. Four of the children have finished
college, and one is still attending. The Burnetts said the sisters helped steer
the children through school and beyond.

The nuns and the Burnetts worked together to develop newspaper routes to deliver
The Clarksdale Press Register. "The children would come in in the evening and
roll those papers up and get them to the readers," Mrs. Burnett said.

Mr. Burnett said, "If the nuns hear of something the community can benefit from,
they try to get you into it."

Across Main Street from the Burnetts' business is Uptown Brown, a take-out
barbecue shop. Bennie Brown, 49, the second-generation owner, has just opened a
youth center in the shuttered school.

With sports programs there, Mr. Brown wants to steer young people ages 10 to 18
from the drugs sold openly here. Sister Teresa Shields of the Holy Name order,
who runs tutoring and social programs for children in kindergarten to sixth
grade, helped organize the center and is a member of its board.

The nuns have touched Mr. Brown in another way, too.

"I think the Lord was calling for this work to be done," he said. "But the
people here hadn't made themselves available. By watching the nuns, they
inspired me to be involved in a ministry. I learned to put my whole self into
what I learned from them."

Three years ago, Mr. Brown was ordained a Baptist minister. A year later he
became pastor of St. Paul's Ministry, one of Jonestown's five churches, all a
century old and none of them Roman Catholic.

Townspeople know of no Catholics among them, other than the nuns. When Bishop
William Houck of the Jackson Diocese invited the nuns into the towns, Sister Kay
said, "he told us we were not to evangelize but to educate."

"We're teachers," she said.

Sister Kay lives in a large, white stucco house two blocks from City Hall, next
to the new Montessori school, where two sisters from Clarksdale teach. Her
bedroom is next to the kitchen. Volunteers, often college students on vacation,
stay in a dormitory upstairs and in two rooms downstairs.

Scattered about are three pianos, four electric keyboards and four computers,
all donated. In the living room on many evenings, about 30 teenage participants
in Sister Kay's Girls to Women program settle around the living room to recite
poetry, perform skits, watch videotapes and begin planning careers.

A large sunny room in back is Sister Kay's classroom, with four tables joined in
a square. Teenage students come in for tutoring. Older people stop in for help
in earning high school equivalency diplomas.

"My purpose is to promote the idea that as people become educated, they will
volunteer to help others when we pass on," Sister Kay said.

Often, economists and sociologists suggest that Delta towns once rooted in
agriculture have outlived their purpose with the mechanization of farming. They
suggest that the young move to communities with more jobs and that the towns be
plowed back into cotton.

Valid or not, it is not a proposition that engages the nuns. "There are 600
children in elementary school here," said Sister Teresa, 57. "Whether they
eventually leave or grow up here, they deserve the best."

WSU president to resign next year

Wayne State University President Irvin Reid announced Wednesday that he will
resign next spring, after more than a decade in office.

Reid, 66, said the timing was right to step down as president because many
administrative goals he had set for his tenure in office were complete or well
on their way. He did not elaborate on his plans.

Reid became the university's ninth president in 1997, after serving as president
of Montclair State University in New Jersey. The university announced Wednesday
that its board of governors will form a committee and begin a national search
immediately.

LaSalle to cut 1,500 jobs; Troy HQ status uncertain

The Bank of America Corp. will cut about 1,500 jobs at Troy-based LaSalle Bank
Midwest N.A. over the next two years after its $21 billion purchase of LaSalle
Bank Midwest and Chicago-based LaSalle Bank N.A., which is expected to close
today.

But no decision has been made on whether the North Carolina-based bank-holding
company will retain the current Michigan headquarters in Troy, according to
Lawrence Di Rita, Bank of America's senior vice president for communications.

LaSalle Bank Midwest employs about 4,000, including about 800 at its
headquarters. The bank has 261 branches in Michigan and six in Indiana. Di Rita
said no closings are planned as of now.

McLaren Health buys Pontiac hospital

Flint-based McLaren Health Care Thursday morning said it purchased POH Medical
Center in Pontiac for an undisclosed amount.

Under McLaren, POH will operate as POH Regional Medical Center.

McLaren President and CEO Philip Incarnati said the first order of business is
to get POH profitable by looking for efficiencies from pooled purchasing,
managed care contracting and shared services.

McLaren plans to expand POH, Incarnati said.

House passes bills that would cut tax exemptions

The state House on Monday passed bills that would eliminate some $503.3 million
in tax exemptions largely affecting business.

House Bills 5252-5256, sponsored by Andy Meisner, D-Ferndale, and sent over
Republican opposition to the Senate, would end exemptions for items that include
meals provided by employers to employees, international calls, bad debts related
to retail sales, and sale of some aircraft parts and materials.

UM Health gets $22M gift

Foundation names chairman

BYLINE:

SECTION: INTERNATIONAL; Pg. D2

LENGTH: 755  words


David Holt has been named chairman of the Friends of The Moncton Hospital
Foundation.

Holt, who is the president of Modern Enterprises Limited and the Modern Group of
Companies, has been on the board of the foundation for five years, serving on
various committees and campaigns fulfilling the mission of the Friends.

His first volunteer role with the Foundation was as a member of the Healthy
Returns Capital Campaign Cabinet. The campaign, launched in 2005, raised $7.5
million for the Irving Ambulatory Care Centre at The Moncton Hospital.

Holt was elected chair at the Friends Annual General Meeting held in May. He
succeeds Larry Nelson, who completed a three-year term.

He says teamwork is the basis for success for any organization, and the
Foundation is no exception.

"Without the expertise, guidance and commitment of past chairs, like Larry
Nelson and Barbara A. Tait who recently completed a 16-year term on the board,
we would not be in the strong position we are in today. My fellow board members
and I are indebted to them for their outstanding dedication to The Moncton
Hospital and to the community," he said.

The Foundation's three-year strategic plan will focus on further growth and
development.

Windjammer features

100-mile menu

From July 7 to mid-September, The Windjammer Restaurant in downtown Moncton will
feature a 100 Mile Menu, showcasing the freshest and finest products from within
a 100-mile radius of Moncton. From cheese to lamb, from seafood to fruits and
vegetables, the 100 Mile Menu will celebrate the very best that the farmers,
ranchers and fisheries from our area have to offer.

Special touches to the 100 Mile Menu are the fresh herbs and garnishes grown in
the rooftop garden at the Delta Beauséjour, as well as the hotel's own honey
produced by the honey bees in the urban beehive located on the hotel rooftop.
Says Raymond Roberge, general manager of the Delta Beauséjour: "Executive chef
Stefan Mueller and his culinary team are passionate about working with the fresh
products that are caught, raised and farmed close to home, supporting and
celebrating our regional fishers, producers and farmers."

Every featured item on the 100 Mile Menu celebrates the fine products of the
local area, all presented with the outstanding service guests have come to
expect when dining at The Windjammer. Maître D' Frédéric Mazerolle and the
Windjammer Team are proud to be recipients of the AAA/CAA Four Diamond Award for
the 19th consecutive year.

Sanford clinic bolsters state's 'safety net';
Spruce Street Health Center offers affordable medical services, dental care and
counseling.

BYLINE: JOSIE HUANG Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL & STATE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 712 words

DATELINE: SANFORD


Try as she did to take care of her teeth, Ann Egan lost four of them to decay.
She sank $675 into ill-fitting dentures, then couldn't find a dentist to adjust
them for an affordable price.  After two years of discomfort, the Sanford woman
got an appointment at Spruce Street Health Center. "It's so tight," Egan, 70,
told the clinic's dentist Friday. "I can't even eat a grape or cracker with it
on. I tried."

Bad dentures, missing teeth, rows of cavities - these are health problems
associated with poorer, more rural parts of Maine, not York County, a place
known for affluent seaside communities and explosive population growth.

But to clinicians at Spruce Street Health Center, these clearly are issues
endemic in Maine's southernmost county, which quietly struggles with pockets of
poverty and a shortage of health care practitioners.

For every 3,012 York County residents, there is just one dentist, compared with
2,165-to-1 statewide. The physician ratio for York County - 1,506-to-1 - also is
worse than the state ratio of 1,039-to-1.

To counter those numbers, Spruce Street Health Center opened this year, becoming
Maine's 18th federally qualified health center - and York County's first. Under
the designation, Spruce Street receives substantial support from the federal
government for seeing everybody who walks through its doors, regardless of their
ability to pay.

"Now we can say we have a safety net extending from Fort Kent to Sanford," said
Kevin Lewis, executive director of the Maine Primary Care Association, which
represents the centers.

Since late March, the clinic has provided dental care, counseling and medical
services to more than 800 people. On a recent day this week, the receptionist
juggled 38 calls from people asking for appointments.

"I didn't think the need would be as huge as it has been," Mary Ann Gleason, the
program director, said Friday at an open house.
UNMET NEED

People with little or no insurance in York County have options, such as visiting
the Biddeford Free Clinic, which is open two weeknights, or applying for free or
discounted care through hospitals. Some travel to federally qualified health
centers in other counties.

But York County Community Action Corp. recognized a significant unmet need -
especially for a place open every weekday - and set about applying for federal
grants in late 2003.

With the Kiwanis Club announcing plans to close its free clinic in Sanford last
fall, urgency mounted. Last October, the agency finally got word that it had
received the federal grants and made plans to renovate 1,300 square feet of
space at its headquarters in downtown Sanford.

The timing couldn't have been more perfect for Anthony McIntyre of Sanford. He
was income-eligible for MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program. But in April,
his monthly disability check grew by $27, kicking him off the insurance rolls.

Because of a heart bypass in 2003, he needed regular checkups and was wondering
how he would pay his doctor. Then he heard about Spruce Street.

"At least people like me can have a place where we can come that's affordable,"
said McIntyre, 52, after paying $10 for his appointment Friday.

Services are charged on a sliding scale but are free to people who are
impoverished or homeless.
'IT FEELS BETTER'

Visitors to the clinic are brought into one of four sparkling new exam rooms and
three dental operatories. Tom's of Maine and Northeast Delta Dental Foundation
each donated $15,000 to equip the operatories, allowing for the purchase of a
digital X-ray machine.

The federal government covers about a quarter of annual costs, such as salaries
for the 10 employees, including a physician and a dentist. The rest comes from a
patchwork of grants, state funding and donations from such groups as the United
Way and private individuals.

This has made it possible for Egan to relax about her finances, though she
winced as Dr. Kathleen Myers adjusted her lower plate. At last, after much
tweaking, Egan said, "It feels better than it did."

Myers said, "We'll get you back in a week and see how you feel," a sign that
Egan's relationship with Spruce Street has just begun.

Programs share 'successes' for kids

BYLINE: Michaela Gibson Morris, Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo,
Miss.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 568 words


Feb. 26--MERIDIAN -- The following four community success stories from around
the state were highlighted Wednesday at the Kids Count summit.

"These are community-based programs created by caring people," said Linda
Southward, Mississippi Kids Count director. "They can be replicated."

In Tupelo

CATCH Kids in Tupelo started with an intersection between Tupelo pediatrician
Dr. Ed Ivancic and the North Mississippi Medical Center foundation's efforts to
tend to children's health needs. A task force found grant funding, and a needs
survey identified transportation and work schedules as the biggest barriers to
getting children to the doctor.

So the school and night-time community-based clinics were created, staffed by
volunteer health professionals. In 2007, CATCH Kids took care of 883 children
and provided $35,000 in dental care.

In Hattiesburg

The Forrest County Youth Court Team in Hattiesburg was born out of national and
local connections. Contacts that Judge Michael McPhail made at a national
conference provided a model that was piloted in Miami and obtained grant money.

Program coordinator Josie Brown, who was retiring from the Department of Human
Services, brought in a network of agencies that lets them wrap services around
the children and their families.

"Once we pulled all the agencies to the table, we had a lot more resources than
we realized," Brown said.

As a result, families move faster toward stability and parents have more contact
with their children as they work to meet the court's requirements to regain
custody.

"Parents used to be able to visit with their children once a month," said Brown
said. "Now they have visitation three times a week."

In Quitman County

The Quitman County Development Organization has been around for 30 years,
spawning First Delta Credit Union, an early childhood program, an after-school
program and a arts program.

It developed a Youth Credit Union Program, which now has $80,000 in assets with
1,200 members.

"The kids went to Sen. Robert Jackson and Pearl Watts, the youth director, and
said we want to save, too,'" said Sharon Upshaw, youth coordinator.

That grew into money management workshops and the Smart Talk/Sweet Shop Store,
which is owned and operated by the youth, Upshaw said.

In Jonestown

The Jonestown Family Center for Education and Wellness and The Durocher Program
grew out of the efforts of nuns with Sisters with the Holy Names order, which is
based in the Pacific Northwest. They got help from the Phil Hardin Foundation,
which provided a building.

The Montessori school provides early childhood education, but other programs
focus on grade school children, teens and parents. The community near Clarksdale
has embraced the programs; the Montessori students include not just children
from poor families, but the children of the mayor, bankers and other leading
residents.

"It's for everyone," said Sister Teresa Shields.

The education extends into volunteer efforts for the community.

BUSINESS BRIEFING

SECTION: Financial; D02

LENGTH: 750 words


ECONOMY

The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in May. The
increase was the smallest in three months. Excluding price increases, spending
was up only 0.1 percent in May, down from a 0.2 percent increase in
inflation-adjusted spending in April.

COMPUTER SECURITY

Symantec is warning that it has detected a new piece of "malware" that tries to
exploit a flaw in Mac OS X systems that Apple Computer released a software
security update to fix just three days ago. "OSX.Exploit.Launchd" exploits a
security hole in the "launchd" service, which controls which programs should
boot up when a user restarts a Mac. According to Symantec, this provides the
attacker full control over any Mac system running OS X version 10.4.6 or
earlier. For more information, see Brian Krebs's Security Fix blog at
washingtonpost.com/securityfix.

MEDIA

French lawmakers gave final approval to government-backed legislation that could
force Apple Computer to make its iPod music player and iTunes online store
compatible with rivals' offerings. Both the Senate and the National Assembly,
France's lower house, voted in favor of the copyright bill, which some analysts
said could cause Apple to close iTunes France and pull its player from the
country's shelves. Songs bought on iTunes can be played only on iPods.

HEALTH CARE

Sunrise Senior Living of McLean agreed to buy six Florida assisted-living
communities with an unidentified joint-venture partner for $457 million. Sunrise
is to own a quarter of the Aston Gardens communities. Sunrise is to pay about
$40 million in cash while the partner pays about $120 million. The rest of the
cost is to be paid with a loan obtained by the joint venture.

AIRLINES

Southwest Airlines pilots rejected the company's offer of a one-year contract
extension. The company and the Southwest Airlines Pilots' Association instead
will begin talks, probably in August, on a new agreement. More than 80 percent
of pilots casting ballots voted against extending the existing contract beyond
Aug. 31.

A New York bankruptcy judge gave Delta Air Lines another four months to
exclusively file its reorganization plan. Delta, which had already received a
six-month extension, asked for more time to address pensions and other
obligations. It now has until Nov. 8 to file the plan and until Jan. 8, 2007, to
solicit acceptances.

WALL STREET

NYSE Group plans to raise transaction fees at the New York Stock Exchange
starting Aug. 1 to benefit from increased trading. NYSE plans to raise by 25
percent the maximum fee it collects from brokers for executing trading at the
exchange to $750,000 a month. A cap that limited fees to 2 percent of a broker's
total commissions will be scrapped.

BROADCASTING

Radio One of Lanham said chief operating officer Mary Catherine Sneed resigned.
Chief executive Alfred Liggins III is to serve as acting COO until a permanent
replacement is named. Sneed, who left to pursue other interests, became an
executive officer of Radio One in January 1998 and played a large role, helping
oversee the business and music sides for the company. As supervisor of the
program directors who decide what goes on the air, she was one of the most
powerful women in urban radio.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

Arcelor shareholders rejected a merger with Russia's OAO Severstal, removing a
major hurdle to Mittal Steel's bid to take over the company and form a steel
titan with nearly 10 percent of global production. The vote cleared the way for
Arcelor to recommend that shareholders accept Mittal's $31.92 million offer for
the company.

Cendant agreed to sell its travel distribution services unit, Travelport, to an
affiliate of private-equity firm Blackstone Group for $4.3 billion. The move is
part of a plan announced in October to split Cendant, the owner of Days Inn and
CheapTickets, into four companies by selling three of its units. The company
plans to spin off Realogy and Wyndham Worldwide to shareholders in separate
transactions in late July.

GOVERNANCE

Shares of Computer Sciences, which manages computers for the Defense Department,
fell 13 percent, to $48.56, after the company canceled a sale of itself and said
its stock-option grants are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Computer Sciences, which had announced April 4 that it may sell
itself, instead will buy back as much as $2 billion in stock.

The Zik Legacy - Redressing a National Disconnect [opinion]

LENGTH: 1382 words


THE birth of Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital came as a result of the
genuine aspirations of the people in the present Anambra, Imo, and parts of
Delta and Abia states, who hitherto had to travel hundreds of kilometres of bad
roads to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, to receive
specialised hospital care services.

This aspiration of the people was backed by the government desire to provide
quality health care for the citizenry and also an opportunity to train some of
the teeming youths who are qualified and desirous to make medical practice and
other professional training allied to medicine as a profession.

But today, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, as the symbol and
representative value of Zik's legacy of championing the aspirations of the
people, is under serious threats of infrastructural and development constraints;
to such an extent that NAUTH, still operating from the temporal site, do
significantly diminish the stature of Zik as a national, continental and global
democracy icon.

The hospital was established via the Anambra State Edict N0. 10 of 1988. Its
present location though temporal, along the Old Onitsha Road, was formally the
Nnewi GeneralHospital under the Anambra State Health Management Board. The
hospital was officially handed over to the Anambra State University of
Technology Teaching Hospital Management Board, on June 6, 1990, and was
commissioned on Friday July 19, 1991. It was taken over by the Federal
Government as Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital in September 1992.

This attempt to draw attention to the history of NAUTH is to portray in proper
perspective the constraints to meaningful growth and development as a result of
the hospital having to remain for decades at the temporary site. It helps to
strike a balance between the present level of development at the permanent site
and also offer a useful insight into the limited range of funding from the
Federal Government for the development of NAUTH since inception.

This also provides immediate basis and content for fruitful and significant
appraisal of the range of problems involved in the development of NAUTH, as a
national institution befitting the stature and eminence of a national and
continental hero- the great Zik of Africa.

It is valid and worth saying, even in order to remind ourselves, that our
culture and other cultures have known and accepted the fact that it does confer
legitimacy and value-added sense of belonging and national pride, the
application of the names of past national heroes and icons to edify institutions
and places. It helps to give future generations proper nationalistic
orientation.

This is the imperative, at this time, as we prepare to celebrate the centenary
of our existence as a nation, to bring to bear on the Nigerian national
consciousness and focus, the state of one of the institutions in Nigeria that
bears the name of one of our founding fathers.

The Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital has several centres for
community medicine and primary health care. There are also two specialised
centres for eye and trauma, located in Onitsha (Guinness Eye Centre) and Oba
(Trauma Centre), respectively.

The spread of NAUTH's community health care centres across AnambraState is
projected to ensure initiation and implementation of programmes and other
activities aimed at the provision of quality and timely healthcare services to
the people, and at costs they can afford. It also envisions an increase in the
quality and life expectancy of Nigerians by ensuring reduction of incidences of
both communicable and non-communicable diseases with the aim of meeting the
global target on the eradication of diseases and infirmities.

Quality of care in health service delivery is the extent to which actual care is
in conformity with set criteria for good care. Quality of care has two aspects,
namely:

* The quality of the provision of care within the institution.

* The quality of the care as experienced by the users.

The provision of care by the medical personnel and staff of NAUTH might be of
the highest technical quality, but the pertinent and central factor of the
current lack of space for admission of patients, provision of offices for
consultants and other categories of personnel, and the congestion of people,
facilities, vehicles and service units within the temporary location cannot make
for effective and efficient healthcare service delivery.

History is replete with the importance and significant role of economic
intervention measures in advancing the growth and development of nations,
corporate organisations and institutions, at crucial periods in their growth and
development process.

The need for the Federal Government intervention measure for NAUTH to relocate
to its permanent site has basis in history. The administration of President
Olusegun Obasanjo did grant the University of Jos Teaching Hospital presidential
grant as an intervention take-off fund to enable the hospital move to its
permanent site.

Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital, since inception for more than two
decades, has not received any intervention package to boost the pace of
development at the permanent site. As a matter of fact, it will take more
decades with respect to the nature of paltry capital fund releases presently,
for the hospital to move to its permanent site, functionally.

The development of NAUTH, as a tertiary health care institution within the
environment of its coming into being, is of a unique character. Much of the
modern buildings complementing the old general hospital infrastructure at the
temporal site existence of NAUTH since inception, were built and endowed to the
hospital by private individuals and organizations from Nnewi community.

So, even as NAUTH should be seen as a national edifice befitting the eminence,
role and place of the person of Rt. Hon. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, first Nigerian
President and frontline Pan Africanist, there is yet no trace of national
identification with the project of the development of NAUTH.

Culturally, in nations that aspire to enthrone genuine national consciousness
and patriotic zeal in the citizenry, foundational elements of nation building
are enhanced through deliberate elevation of national institutions, as are
endowed to heroes past, to the highest level of excellence as models and symbols
of national pride. This national identification should be accorded NAUTH at this
initial stage of its development. This will further boost and foster national
cohesion, sense of value and collective responsibility for achieving national
goals and objectives. This road to nation building will usher positive
developments in other sections and aspects of the national economy and
socio-political process.

Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital has enormous potentials for growth
and greatness. These abound in the technical expertise, resilience, doggedness
and drive of the hospital's workforce and successive management administrations
since inception.

But the evidence that the great Zik of Africa came from this part of the globe
should be seen in the accelerated growth and development of the hospital at the
permanent site, and not in the reflection of the intrinsic values and traits
that remind emerging generations of a people about the stories of their parents
survival of the civil war and the continuing alienation and disconnect from the
national scheme of things.

The debt we owe our heroes past, for the sacrifices they made for us, can only
be redeemed through changes in national attitudes and perception of objectives
as regards the value and importance of national institutions and symbols of our
existence.

It was not for any fault of Rt. Hon. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, as a champion of the
aspirations of Nigerians for independence, and the emancipation of the blackman,
for which he labored and suffered, that Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching
Hospital is made unable to attain its purpose. It is our collective shame as a
nation.

Should we cease to have any sense of shame and guilt, therefore, the prospects
and hope for greatness for this nation, Nigeria, as dreamed of by our founding
fathers, will continue to diminish by the day.

3 area groups to get $10,000 grants

BYLINE: Debra Pressey, The News-Gazette, Champaign-Urbana, Ill.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 241 words


Oct. 29--CHAMPAIGN _ Three area organizations _Promise Healthcare, the Douglas
County Health Department and Lake Land College _ are each receiving $10,000
grants from the Delta Dental of Illinois Foundation.

The foundation selected 12 organizations throughout the state to share in nearly
$100,000 of community grants to help improve oral health care for children.

Promise Healthcare, the parent organization of Frances Nelson Health Center and
SmileHealthy, is receiving money to continue paying for a dental hygienist at
the Frances Nelson Health Center's well child and prenatal clinics.

At the clinics, patients receive oral health education and are introduced to an
on-site dental center.

"It's really important to integrate oral health and medical care," Promise
Healthcare Executive Director Nancy Greenwalt said.

The grant to the Douglas County Health Department is to support a partnership
between the health department dental clinic and the Wellness on Wheels van.

The wellness van will visit Amish and Mennonite schools in Douglas and Moultrie
counties and provide oral education, exams, cleanings and referrals to kids and
teens ages 5-15.

Lake Land College, Mattoon, is receiving a grant for equipment to be used in the
training of dental hygiene students and clinical and technical staff.

COLUMN: Neighbors

Worcester State University recently celebrated the legacy of Professor Emeritus
Melvin Merken, who retired in 2010 after 52 years of service, at its 18th annual
Scholarship Tea.

Mr. Merken joined Worcester State Teachers College's Chemistry Department in
1958 after several years as a high school science teacher. A graduate of Tufts
University, he was named a full professor in 1967 after earning a doctorate from
Boston University. Over the years, he served as chairman of the department of
chemistry and physics, and department of natural and earth sciences.

Mr. Merken also chaired WSU's Curriculum Committee for 30 years. In that
capacity he was intimately involved in the development of many university
programs.

He is a Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science and
the American Institute of Chemists and a member of a number of professional
organizations.

He received an Educator of the Year Award from the Central Mass. Chapter, Phi
Delta Kappa in 2002, the Commonwealth Citation for Outstanding Performance in
1989 and 1996, and the Distinguished Service Award from Worcester State in 1980,
1984 and 1988.

Mr. Merken and his wife, Shirley Stahl Merken '96 - to whom he became engaged
just two weeks after they met on a blind date in 1956 - raised their three
children in a house within walking distance of WSU. They demonstrated their
ongoing commitment to Worcester State's students by establishing two
scholarships: the Dr. Melvin and Shirley Stahl Merken Two Cultures Scholarship
and the Arlyn Stahl Berlin Scholarship.

Mr. Merken said on his retirement, "After 52 years, I could sincerely say that I
loved what I did and never regretted that I did not retire sooner."

Sharon Eichorn has been named to the dean's list for the spring semester at the
Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.

Students from North High School and Worcester Vocational Technical High School
recently participated in the Health Occupations Student of America State
Leadership Conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Area Health Education
Center Network at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.

More than 170 students attended the conference, and most competed in one of 18
health care skills and were judged by teams of health care professionals.
Placing in the top three for a competitive event qualified students to advance
to the HOSA national competition this month in Orlando, Fla.

Among the top winners was Worcester Tech junior Paula Machado for Veterinary
Science.

At North, the top three winners of Concepts of Health Care were seniors
Francisco Crisostoma and Mercy Frimpong, and sophomore Anh Vo. Senior D'Aven
Robinson took second place in Dental Terminology, junior Sandra Bazitya placed
second in Human Growth & Development and sophomore Jennifer Bui took second
place in Medical Math.

Sophomore Kelly Akuffo and junior Nina Nguyen placed first and second in
Nutrition, while seniors Maria O'Leary and Bienmi Berroa-Soto placed first and
second in Pathophysiology. Senior Kiet Le placed first in Pharmacology, and
senior Rochely Mata and junior Kassandra Rivera placed second and third in Job
Seeking. Junior Mary Baker and sophomore Karen Abegunde placed first and third
in Medical Photography, while the two-person team of Ruthchie Jean and Kimberly
Akuffo, both juniors, won second place in Career Health Display.

U.S. Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Worcester, is the recipient of Worcester
Academy's 2012 Distinguished Alumnus Award.

After graduating from the academy in 1977, Mr. McGovern earned his B.A. and
Master's of Public Administration degrees from the American University, working
his way through college by serving as an aide in the office of U.S. Sen. George
McGovern. He also managed Sen. McGovern's 1984 presidential campaign. He then
spent 14 years as senior aide for the late U.S. Rep. John Joseph Moakley.

Now in his eighth term in Congress representing Central and Southeastern
Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern serves as a Senior Minority Whip; the second-ranking
Democrat on the House Rules Committee; and a member of the House Agriculture
Committee.

Worcester Academy also presented its 2012 Young Alumnus Recognition Award to
Philip Kalmanovitch, '02.

After graduating from the academy, Mr. Kalmanovitch attended Queen's University
in Kingston, Ontario, earning a B.A.H. in drama and a B.A. minor in music. In
2011, he received the Galaxie Musique Rising Star Award from the prestigious
Atelier lyrique de L'Opera de Montreal, as well as the International Vocal
Artists Silverman Scholarship.

A baritone, Mr. Kalmanovitch has already performed in several l'Opera de
Montreal productions and with touring companies, as well as in dozens of plays
and musicals. A founding and performing member of Open Corps Theater in Toronto,
he has produced "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris" and
Stravinsky's "A Soldier's Tale."

Dr. John Giordano was promoted to major in the Army National Guard Dental Corps,
where he serves as a Massachusetts state dental officer. Dr. Giordano continues
to maintain his dental practice and his forensic practice, the Forensic
Dentistry Resource Center in Worcester.

LENGTH: 340 words

DATELINE: PITTSFIELD


The Oral Health Foundation has announced the awarding of a $200,000 grant to
Hillcrest Dental Care, a program of Hillcrest Educational Centers Inc., to
expand its treatment capacity to serve its special needs patients, including
children, adolescents and adults, as well as its MassHealth and other low-income
clients without insurance.

The Oral Health Foundation was established in 2000 by DSM, doing business as
Delta Dental Plan of Massachusetts, to award annual grants to organizations that
are working towards reducing oral health disparities in disadvantaged
populations across Massachusetts. Hillcrest Dental Care is one of six new
projects receiving a total of almost $900,000 in grant money this year. Ongoing
program support will bring the Oral Health Foundation grant awards to nearly
$1.5 million in 2004.

The grant money will be used to expand treatment capacity by 75 percent with the
additional of three new dental chairs and new specialized treatment equipment.
Hillcrest Dental Care is the largest provider in the Berkshire region for dental
care to MassHealth, low-income, and special needs patient. Hillcrest Dental Care

percent, are special needs and low-income patients. Almost 1,500 Hillcrest
Dental Care patients have no dental insurance.

HillcrestEducational Centers' Hillcrest Dental Care was selected to receive a
$200,000 grant because it meets the Foundation's goal of providing access to
dental services for underserved populations. Hillcrest Educational Centers

disturbed children and adolescents, and Hillcrest Dental Care provides
comprehensive dental care to large numbers of special needs persons, many of
whom reside in residential treatment centers, nursing homes, and long-term care

Red Cross faces critical need for blood

BYLINE: Maria Saporta

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 03F Maria Saporta

LENGTH: 735 words


The Southern Region of the American Red Cross is in desperate need of blood,
especially before this holiday weekend.

So it is turning to the business community for help.

On Thursday, Red Cross officials made a plea to their "LifeBoard," a recently
formed partnership of 11 major companies, to urge people to donate blood ---not
only for this weekend but year-round.

"We are at emergency levels," said Alan Elias, blood services administrator for
the Red Cross here. "We are down 3,500 pints in the month of August. Our
hospitals right now are just 70 percent stocked."

Elias said the Red Cross strives to collect about 1,000 pints a day in the
Atlanta area. But blood collections are averaging about 800 pints a day, because
fewer people are donating. The Red Cross is having to import about 26,440 pints
of blood annually to the Atlanta area from around the country.

''The problem we are encountering is that there is a nationwide blood shortage,"
Elias said. "Every blood center is losing about 3 percent in collections a
year."

The Red Cross provides blood products to 130 local hospitals and health care
facilities.

All week, the Red Cross has been dangerously low on several blood types. For
example, on Thursday afternoon, it had no available pints for O negative and A
negative, and it had only 14 pints of O positive, even though it needs 580 pints
of O positive. There was a significant shortage of every blood type.

As a way to combat the problem of declining blood donations, American Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole came to Atlanta on June 23 to initiate a local
LifeBoard program.

Eleven companies have signed on as corporate champions, agreeing to an action
plan, such as having at least four blood drives at their workplaces each year.
The companies are BellSouth, Coca-Cola Co., Cox Enterprises, Delta Air Lines,
Equifax, Genuine Parts, Georgia Power, JC Penney Catalog, NationsBank, SunTrust
Bank and Wachovia Bank.

Elias said the Red Cross hopes to add three to five companies to its LifeBoard
each year. The hope is to increase the number of donors as well as the frequency
of existing donors. On its list of active donors (those who have given in the
last two years), the average giving each year is between one and two pints.
Elias said that if the Red Cross could just have its existing donors give one
more pint each year, there would be no threat of shortages in Atlanta.

In an attempt to combat this weekend's blood shortages, the Red Cross is holding
"Labor of Love" blood drives at six locations today through Wednesday between
noon and 7 p.m. The blood drives are being held at Northlake Mall, North Point
Mall, Kinder's Outlet Mall in Cobb, Tanger Outlet Center, Gwinnett Civic &
Cultural Center and Outlets Limited Mall in Gwinnett. For further information,
call 800-GIVE-LIFE.

Cancer fund-raiser

More than 50 companies have signed on to have corporate teams in the Race for
the Cure on Oct. 25 to benefit the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Last
year the race raised $ 190,000 for local organizations fighting breast cancer.
It also contributed $ 76,000 to the national foundation, which helps fund breast
cancer research and education.

"We hope to have at least 100 corporate teams," said Thomas G. Coley, president
of SouthTrust-Georgia, who is honorary chairman of the race.

Coley, who spoke at the kickoff breakfast for corporate sponsors Thursday, said
that every 13 minutes a woman in the United States dies of breast cancer. Coley
introduced his wife at the breakfast as a survivor of breast cancer. Her mother
wasn't so lucky.

The breakfast included several testimonials from people who have survived breast
cancer. And Dr. Linda Michelson of the Women's Breast Health Center at St.
Joseph's Hospital said mamograms and self-examinations continue to be the best
way to diagnose breast cancer.

Selma Morris, a Grady Health System official, started the East West Breast
Express, which gets the message out to MARTA riders. The two initiatives of
Morris and Michelson have received grants from the Susan G. Komen Foundation.

Rae Weimer, president of the foundation's Atlanta chapter, said this year's race
hopes to attract at least 10,000 runners and walkers.

Mainers still caring for others despite hard times

BYLINE: JONI AVERILL

SECTION: Pg. B4

LENGTH: 769 words


Today's column continues the theme of the generosity of Mainers, from
individuals to organizations and business owners, who care enough to help their
neighbors, especially during a difficult economy, through the gifts of time,
money and volunteering.

More than 120 Alzheimer's Champions in the Rockland area raised more than $6,300
to fund Alzheimer's care, support and research during September's annual
Alzheimer's Association Memory Walk held by the Knox Center for Long Term Care,
reported Christopher Burke of Pen Bay Healthcare.

Burke's release reminds readers that 5.3 million Americans are living with the
disease, and 30,000 of those are Maine residents.

Speaking of taking steps to help others, Mary-Ann Saxl reported that the Warren
Center for Communication and Learning's first Hike for Hearing, in September,
organized by the Dirigo Alumnae Chapter of Delta Zeta Sorority and member Linda
Allen, was "a great success."

Proceeds benefited "programming at the Warren Center" in Bangor, "which provides
speech and hearing services to residents in eastern and central Maine," Saxl
said.

While local individuals do all they can to support area organizations, national
companies do their part to help members of communities where their businesses
are located, as evidenced by a $10,000 grant the Warren Center received this
year from the Rite Aid Foundation.

That donation was in support of the Warren Center's Regional Hearing Aid Bank
program, which enables the Warren Center "to provide hearing aids to members of
the community who could not otherwise afford them," according to the press
release from the Warren Center.

When members of the Maine Business and Professional Women's Club gathered for
their annual spring board meeting in Bangor, they continued their tradition of
selecting a local nonprofit to be the recipient of a charitable donation.

This year, Maine BPW selected the Good Samaritan Agency of Bangor, according to
a Good Samaritan release.

Maine BPW members then collected and donated a total of 2,475 items, from
diapers to wipes, books and cash, for the agency that, since 1902, has provided
services for single parents, including an alternative education program, a day
care program and adoption services.

Judy Bragg and Sandra Carter serve as co-presidents of Maine BPW, according to
its Web site.

Judy Berk wrote the Bangor Daily News recently to report on the Natural
Resources Council of Maine's October fundraiser, "The Art of Local Food," in
Rockport.

"By all accounts," Berk wrote of the tasting party, "this was an incredibly
successful event.

"It raised money to support NRCM's work to protect Maine's environment, and the
place was abuzz with hundreds of people who enjoyed delicious local foods and
inspired local beverages, chatted with friends old and new, took in the art
exhibit and listened to jazz piano."

While I can't list all those who supported this event, Berk wants readers to
know "this gathering would not have been possible without the strong and
steadfast support of our incomparable midcoast community and an incredible team
of volunteers, farmers, chefs, fishermen and other members of Maine's vibrant
food economy."

On behalf of NRCM executive director "Brownie Carson and all 12,000 NRCM
supporters," Berk extends thanks to those "wonderful people and businesses, and
to the many generous food lovers who came to the event."

Bangor Health and Community Services director Shawn Yardley wrote the BDN on
behalf of his department and the Bangor Regional Influenza Coalition to thank
the "many people ... for their efforts in working with us to respond as quickly
as possible to the H1N1 and seasonal flu threats."

Staff of local schools as well as state, county and local medical and emergency
agencies and services "quickly committed to pool their limited resources to put
our vaccination plan into motion," Yardley wrote, adding the clinic was also
aided by donations of food, beverages and supplies from many local and area
business owners and managers.

But Yardley saved his most sincere thanks for "the parents of the 4,500-plus
children who brought or sent their children to the clinics."

"Many endured long waits but chose to accept this inconvenience to ensure that
their children received these important vaccinations.

"It was truly a wonderful example of our community coming together in response
to a great need," Yardley wrote.

"The list of thank-yous is long," but "the impact of their efforts will be
longer-lasting," he added.

"Thanks to all who answered the call."

State ready to guide uninsured Delawareans through enrollment on the Health
Insurance Marketplace

BYLINE: Cape Gazette staff

LENGTH: 688  words


Less than a month before Delaware's Health Insurance Marketplace opens for
enrollment, state officials and community organizations said they are ready to
begin the historic program to provide uninsured Delawareans greater access to
affordable healthcare.

Delaware Health and Social Services Secretary Rita Landgraf and Insurance
Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart were joined recently at a kickoff event for
the marketplace by representatives of the four community organizations who will
guide individuals, families and small business owners through the enrollment
process. As part of the Affordable Care Act signed into law in 2010, each state
must establish a marketplace formerly known as an exchange - for individuals who
don't have access to affordable health insurance through work or some other
means.

In addition, small business owners can shop for plans for their employees
through the Small Business Health Options Program. Enrollment for individuals
and small businesses will begin Oct. 1. Information about the marketplace is
available at www.ChooseHealthDE.com, the state's official marketplace website,
which is also available in Spanish.

"This is our collective opportunity to make affordable health insurance and
quality healthcare available to the 90,000 Delawareans who don't have insurance
today," Landgraf said. "With the help of the marketplace guides and our
marketing campaign, we will spread the word that Delaware's health insurance
marketplace will be open for enrollment beginning Oct. 1. For so many
individuals and families, this will mean the end to the fear that one accident
or one illness could send them into a lifetime of debt."

Stewart said the 68 marketplace guides from Brandywine Women's Health
Associates, Christiana Care, the Delmarva Foundation and Westside Family
Healthcare are going through rigorous state and federal training, a proctored
exam, and state and federal background checks before they are certified by the
state to handle sensitive personal information.

"Delawareans will be able to trust the marketplace guides to help them through
enrollment because of the extensive certification process," Stewart said. "Each
guide will have a badge with a certification number, and identification from
their community organization and from the state. Beginning in the middle of this
month, the guides will begin fanning out across the state to help individuals
and small businesses with enrollment, including the possibility of tax credits
to offset the costs."

Delawareans also will receive assistance from federal navigators, who will be
hired by Chatman LLC of Upper Marlboro, Md. Chatman LLC was awarded a federal
grant. In addition, Delaware's three federally qualified health centers,
Henrietta Johnson Medical Center, La Red Health Center and West-side Family
Healthcare, received federal grants to help with consumer assistance.

Stewart said information on the rates for the plans on Delaware's marketplace
will be available before Oct. 1, after the federal government concludes its
approval process. Three issu suers have applied to Delaware's marketplace:
Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware, Coventry Health and Life Insurance
and Coventry Health Care of Delaware. In addition, four stand-alone dental plans
have applied to Delaware's marketplace: Delta Dental, Dentegra, Dominion and
Guardian. Because Delaware opted for a state-federal partnership marketplace,
both the state and the federal governments must approve the plans.

Delaware expects up to 35,000 people to enroll in the marketplace in the first
year. To receive coverage starting Jan. 1, 2014, people must enroll by Dec. 15,
2013. Open enrollment for the 2014 plan year continues through March 31, 2014.

Landgraf said the federal government's 24/7 Call Center, 800-318-2596, or TTY
855-889-4325 can answer questions in 150 languages. If people don't have access
to a computer, they can call the toll-free number to get the help they need to
enroll.

Jackson business leaders go to Washington for White House business briefing

BYLINE: MBJ Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 696  words


More than 25 Jackson business leaders, including Mayor Harvey Johnson, former
Gov. Ronnie Musgrove and State Sen. John Horhn, traveled to Washington, D.C.,
late last week to participate in a White House business leader briefing.

Leaders from the Jackson business community provided feedback to Obama
Administration officials on ways to work together to support economic
competitiveness, job creation, and innovation in Mississippi. The business
leaders brought up issues important to spurring economic growth in Mississippi
including access to capital, healthcare reform implementation, workforce
development, neighborhood stabilization, infrastructure improvement, higher
education affordability, and regulating pay day lenders.

"Business leaders are a critical voice in the policymaking process," said Bert
Kaufman, vice president of Business Forward. "White House officials were more
than a little eager to hear directly from Jackson leaders on issues important to
the area's economy and ideas for spurring job growth. "

Senior administration officials who took part in the briefing included Mark
Doms, chief economist, Department of Commerce; Matt Erskine, deputy assistant
secretary of commerce and COO for the U.S. Economic Development, Department of
Commerce; Sol Ross, director of business outreach, Department of Health and
Human Services; Christopher Masingill, federal co-chairman, Delta Regional
Authority; Brad Cooper, executive director of White House Joining Forces; Sam
Kass, assistant White House chef and White House senior policy advisor for
Healthy Food Initiatives; and, Ari Matusiak, executive director of the White
House Business Council.

Doms gave a macroeconomic overview and discussed all of the economic data that
federal policymakers consider, while answering questions from the group about
oil prices and unemployment rates. One attendee noted that Mississippi's high
incarceration rate has been a hurdle to economic growth.

One business leader complimented the administration on its creation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the President's appointment of
Richard Cordray to direct the new agency.

Ross discussed the details of the Affordable Care Act and how state exchanges,
which begin in January of 2014, will not only provide residents with more
options for healthcare, but will also become important economic drivers in
Mississippi over the next decade.

The group voiced concerns surrounding healthcare reform implementation, but
agreed the state exchanges are necessary. Some of the small business owners
lamented that high health care have prevented them from hiring on additional
employees.

Johnson asked for more information about the Aging and Disability Resource
Centers (ADRC) Nursing Home Transition through Money Follows the Person Grants,
24 states funded to strengthen the ADRCs role in the CMS Money Follows the
Person program and support state Medicaid agencies as they transition
individuals from nursing homes to community-based care. The mayor discussed the
need for this type of extra funding in the Jackson community.

Matusiak and Johnson led a "Partnering for Action" discussion aimed at exploring
public/private partnerships, and the opportunities to take action on important
state and local issues facing businesses in Jackson. The group noted the
American Jobs Act and the administration's plan for infrastructure development
needs to also include the improvement of water and sewage lines, in addition to
roads, bridges, railways and broadband.

Participants represented a wide range of industries that make up Jackson's
economy. Executives from the Bell Group, Molpus Woodlands Group, Minority
Capital Fund of Mississippi Inc., Lumpkins BBQ, Global Security Systems, Triniry
Apparel Group, New York Life Insurance Company and BlackWhite Development were
involved.

The event was the 13th meeting in a series of business leader briefings that are
taking place at the White House throughout the year. Business Forward and the
White House Business Council have partnered to bring more business leaders from
all around the country into the policymaking process.

Rural healthcare challenges abound in communities around Mississippi

BYLINE: Lynn Lofton

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 835  words


In a state that is largely rural, it's no surprise that rural health issues are
increasing in Mississippi. Tops on the list of concerns are socio-economic
issues and lack of access to healthcare professionals and facilities.

Dr. Luke Lampton, chairman of the Mississippi State Board of Health, says the
state has a rural healthcare crisis. "According to American Medical Association
statistics, Mississippi has the lowest number of physicians per capita in the
union," he said, "and the ones we have are mal-distributed in four urban areas.
There are counties in the state without a single doctor within its borders. "

The majority of the state's physicians are located in the urban areas of DeSoto
County, Jackson, Tupelo and Hattiesburg. The Coast, which would normally be on
the list, was affected by Hurricane Katrina but Lampton says its physician count
is bouncing back.

"The study predicts this lack of doctors will probably get worse as many of
those practicing in rural areas are nearing retirement age," he said. "We
haven't faced the worst of the doctor workforce crisis yet. Medical leadership
is putting pressure to get physicians to locate in rural areas. "

One way it is doing that is through the establishment of the Rural Scholarship
Program, which Lampton calls the most innovative of its kind in the country. It
was established in 2007 and funded for one year, but he is hopeful the
Legislature will fully embrace it and continue funding.

"We are trying to grow our own physicians for rural areas by mentoring students
from these areas, giving them medical scholarships and getting them back to
these areas to practice," he said. "There are a lot of obstacles in rural areas
to get to medical school. These students are disadvantaged against students from
urban areas. Studies show that most physicians who locate in rural areas are
originally from those areas. "

It will take a few years to see the effects of this program, and there still may
not be enough physician workforce, but Lampton says a practitioner moving into a
small, rural town is that town's Nissan or Toyota. A Mississippi State
University study reveals an economic impact of $2 to $7 million annually and the
creation of up to 35 jobs for a town by one physician.

Lampton, who practices rural medicine in Pike County, observes that rural
physicians must deal with a high proportion of elderly and Medicare and Medicaid
patients and very little private insurance. These federal programs'
reimbursements are at low rates.

"Health issues are different in rural areas where there's still a lot of poverty
and salaries lag behind urban areas," he said. "Unfortunately, it's not getting
better. "

He also sees a critical need for nurses in rural areas where economies can't
compete for their services.

Rural hospitals with the numerous stresses on them must be supported. "Losing
them will have a significant impact on healthcare," Lampton said. "They must be
maintained and not just as band aid stations. "

The Mississippi Hospital Association agrees. That's why the Center for Rural
Health was established in 2002 to work with these small hospitals in attaining
grant monies. Mendel Kemp, a retired psychiatric hospital administrator and
former employee of the State Department of Health, was recruited as executive
director.

"Rural hospitals have several obstacles. For many, the infrastructure is old.
They're Hill-Burton hospitals built in the 1950s," he said. "They don't have a
lot of money for capital improvements. "

These hospitals must be credit worthy to receive grants, and being critical care
access facilities gets them better reimbursement. Several have been awarded
improvement grants through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Among those are
Kings Daughters Hospital in Yazoo City, S.E. Lackey Hospital in Forrest and
North Sunflower Hospital in Ruleville where a $9-million expansion is being
built.

"Some hospitals are doing great things," Kemp said. "They are improving their
services and making themselves more attractive with what they do best, such as
swing bed care. A lot of patients would rather go to these small hospitals where
they get a lot of attention. "

He, too, laments the difficulty of attracting and retaining healthcare
professionals to rural areas, especially physicians. "It's particularly
challenging in the Delta where Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements are
inadequate," he said. "The center is addressing these problems. Banding together
and working as one is helping. "

Lampton applauds the landmark trauma bill passed by the Legislature in the 2008
session. The Department of Health is putting together a trauma system that will
require participating hospitals to get patients with injuries from accidents and
other trauma to where they need to be as quickly as possible.

"It's in place and will have a good impact in rural areas," he said. "All who
worked on it deserve our gratitude. "

He notes that other rural health issues include access to mental health and
improving preventative medicine.

Bomb Blasts - Terrorists, Not MEND, Responsible - Jonathan

BYLINE: Chuks Ohuegbe, Chika Otuchikere And Nkechi Isaac

LENGTH: 1061  words

DATELINE: Abuja


President Goodluck Jonathan said yesterday that the government of Nigeria knows
the persons who masterminded the bomb blasts that marred Friday's golden jubilee
celebration. He said that it was the handiwork of terrorists and not the
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) as was widely
speculated.

In a swift reaction, however, MEND has again taken responsibility for the deadly
bomb blasts which rocked the FCT and claimed 16 lives, saying that the nation's
security forces should be blamed for the avoidable loss of lives.

Reacting to President Jonathan's statement yesterday that the group had no hand
in the terrorist act, MEND said that it actually carried out the attacks after
it had sent out several warning statements to the security forces several days
before the attack.

Excerpts of the statement read: "The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger
Delta (MEND) deeply regrets the avoidable loss of lives during our bomb attack
in Abuja on Friday, October 1, 2010. Our hearts go to the families of those
killed who we know were sympathetic to our cause. "The irresponsible attitude of
the government security forces is to blame for the loss of lives. They were
given five days prior notice which led to the harassment of Henry Okah on
Thursday, September 30, in South Africa. Okah has never been involved in any
MEND operations but has always been blamed for every attack, which is strange to
us.

"The security forces were also warned one full hour to the first bomb blast
ahead of the general alert sent to the media and told to steer the public from
all parked cars which was not done."

Meanwhile, President Jonathan has promised to overhaul the security services.
This is just as the State Security Service (SSS) is beaming its searchlight on
some top politicians in the country over their alleged involvement in the bomb
blasts that killed no fewer than 16 persons and left scores of others wounded.

LEADERSHIP SUNDAY gathered last night that the camps of some presidential
aspirants will be invited for interrogation.

The president declared yesterday in his address at the colloquim organised by
the ECOWAS Parliament: "We know the persons behind the terrorist attacks on the
nation. We know they used an organisation that operates in the Niger Delta
called MEND as a front, but we are aware that MEND is not a terrorist
organisation."

According to a senior security operative, "we are working on so many leads which
suggest that the blast was politically motivated to disrupt the peace and worsen
the sense of insecurity among Nigerians.

"We believe this might be a political action aimed at disrupting the relative
peace in the country since the grant of amnesty to ex-militants in the country."

A top aide at the presidency had told LEADERSHIP SUNDAY how some political
forces mobilised some terrorists led by Mr. Henry Okah with $100 million to
carry out the attacks.

But President Jonathan said that the widely publicised information that linked
the blast to MEND was diversionary.

"What happened yesterday was a terrorist act and MEND was just used as a straw;
MEND is not a terrorist group.

"The Niger Delta people are aware of the government's noble efforts to assuage
the suffering and deprivation in that region.

"I am from the Niger Delta. My father's house is a few metres from an oil-well,
so nobody can claim to be a Niger Delta than myself.

"It is erroneous to think that my people who have been agitating for good living
will deliberately blow up the opportunity they have now," Jonathan added.

The president stressed that the unfortunate action was carried out by enemies of
the state, saying that security operatives had been mobilised to fish out the
perpetrators.

Jonathan added that the country's security apparatus would be restructured to
become proactive to guarantee the safety of life and property.

"I pray for the souls of those who died to attain peace and fervently pray for
those who sustained injuries in the blast to be healed," he said.

LEADERSHIP had reported yesterday that no fewer than 16 persons lost their lives
at the Eagle Square venue of the bomb blasts. Scores of other Nigerians received
various degrees of wound and are recuperating in hospitals within the Federal
Capital Territory.

On the celebration of the golden jubilee of some African countries, Jonathan
said that the ECOWAS Parliament had reminded African leaders to devote some time
for sober reflection in the face of the celebration.

He said that the leaders must take into account a broad analysis of their
performances as custodians of independent nations.

"We do not have an option than to uphold the ideals of democracy, rule of law
and good governance," he said.

Jonathan added that leaders must ensure that they keep in view the circumstances
and wellbeing of the citizens, which were the focus of the various nationalist
leaders and the pan-Africanists.

"Our today's reality is that many countries in our continent are plagued by
difficult challenges ranging from poverty, poor health care delivery, corruption
to insecurity and maladministration.

"As a result, the continent is in dire need of solutions to these critical
problems; solutions which must be well articulated and fully implemented to
uplift the living standard of the populace," Jonathan stated.

Sen. David Mark, the Senate president, expressed delight on the initiative of
the parliament to celebrate the true freedom of some African states.

He said that the conference would hopefully chart a new course for Africa.

Mark, who also condemned the Friday bomb blasts in Abuja, said that people must
channel their grievances to the authorities, adding that "the blast was an
inhuman outburst and will be checked".

Earlier, Hon. Mahamane Ousmane, the speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, expressed
sadness over the blasts that claimed lives and injured many on the country's
Independence Day.

He said that the entire ECOWAS family and the black race in general must
commiserate with Nigeria at this moment"Nigeria is a huge asset to us and we
must support her survival," he said.

Ousmane explained that the colloquium was organised to proffer solutions to
Africa's challenges, saying people must provide the way forward instead of
destroying what had already been built.

Past and present African leaders, ECOWAS parliamentarians, diplomats and notable
resource persons attended the programme.

Job service plan tried in Georgia Helpers sign up in two counties

BYLINE: By Julie K. Miller STAFF WRITERgeorgia; employment; counties

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Section A; Page 1

LENGTH: 311 words


A groundbreaking job service program - part of a national test project - has
been launched in two rural Georgia counties with a pledge to tackle economic and
social problems facing the country.

About 120 residents of Toombs and McDuffie counties met at the Capitol Monday
and took an oath to serve in the Georgia Peach Corps - a task U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn
said will help address the "unmet social needs in our country."

Jane Degrado, a mother of two and a high school dropout, thinks the federal
money flowing into her rural community will help change lives.

"If I can keep one teenager from getting pregnant and make sure that one girl
gets an education, then I will have done my part," said the 23- year-old Thomson
woman.

The Peach Corps is part of a new national job service program pushed by Mr.
Nunn. It will address such issues as adult literacy, housing rehabilitation and
health care. The project is also being tested in Oklahoma, Maryland, New Jersey,
Boston, Pennsylvania, the Seneca Indian Nation in New York and in the Delta
Corps - Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.

In Georgia, it is composed of 100 people between the ages of 17 and 25 plus
another 20 over the age of 60 and is funded by a $ 2.3 million federal grant
from the Commission on National and Community Service.

Participants will be paid a subsistence salary roughly equivalent to minimum
wage for four days of service work and one day of study each week. When the year
is over, younger members will get $ 5,000 to help further their education.

"That's the grabber," said David Cato, 21, of Thomson, who will take a year off
from classes at Augusta College to work with the disabled, renovate an
elementary school and tutor latchkey kids.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today issued a report highlighting the impact
of more than $33 billion in USDA investments to support rural businesses,
infrastructure and housing in 2013.

"This report tells the story of how USDA support has made a tremendous
difference in the lives of rural Americans," said Vilsack. "Our investments help
create jobs and opportunity for rural residents, provide affordable housing,
support modern infrastructure, and build essential community facilities. I am
proud of the role that USDA has played to grow rural economies and help make
rural America a place of opportunity, innovation and economic growth."

USDA Rural Development's $193 billion portfolio is making lasting investments in
rural communities. The report highlights several initiatives that are helping to
address persistent rural poverty, expand health care for Mississippi Delta
residents, and develop stronger partnerships between government, private-sector
and community-based organizations.

Since the start of the Obama Administration, USDA business programs have
provided more than 18,000 guaranteed loans, direct loans and grants to help more
than 74,000 businesses create or save more than 375,000 jobs. USDA is
increasingly becoming the lender of choice for many Native American tribes
throughout the country.

USDA programs support research into new energy sources and help protect the
environment. During the two last quarters of fiscal year 2013, USDA made
payments to operators of 56 anaerobic digesters that produced almost 173 million
kilowatt hours of electricity - enough to power more than 17,000 homes annually.
For example, Clover Hill Dairy in Campbellsport, Wis., received a $6,200 payment
through the Advanced Biofuel Payment Program to operate its anaerobic digester,
which was commissioned 2007. The digester produces 2.7 million kilowatt hours
(kWh) of energy per year. The dairy's herd provides the manure to produce
biogas, which fuels the generators that produce electricity. The excess
electricity is purchased by a local utility and delivered to customers.

USDA broadband infrastructure loans awarded in FY 2013 will result in new or
upgraded broadband service for about 120,000 rural households, businesses and
community institutions once the projects are completed. The Department also
continued to make great strides to bring distance learning and telemedicine
infrastructure to rural areas. In 2013, one-third of USDA's distance learning
grants went to rural areas where the minority population is 30 percent or
higher. Another third went to areas were poverty rates have been consistently
high over long periods. All of the awards went to rural areas where residents
lacked access to medical services.

Rural Development is a key player in the recovery of the nation's housing
market, particularly in rural areas. For many realtors, USDA Rural Development
loans account for most of their business. In 2013, nearly 163,000 rural families
became homeowners through loans from private lenders that were guaranteed by
USDA, and more than 7,000 families bought homes through direct loans from USDA.

USDA's homeownership program is complemented by assistance that helps rural
residents find affordable rental housing. Tenants pay no more than 30 percent of
their income on rent for decent, safe housing. Last year, USDA provided rental
assistance to nearly 280,000 rural residents. Including the residents who get
rental assistance, more than half a million rural Americans live in rental
housing financed or directly supported by USDA.

USDA's Rural Housing Service invested in more than 1,000 essential community
infrastructure projects with $1.4 billion in direct loans, guaranteed loans and
grants in Fiscal Year 2013.

In other areas, the report indicates that USDA's Rural Utilities Service helped
meet the power needs of 8.7 million rural customers last year by providing
nearly $5 billion in loans to electric utilities. These loans helped build and
expand transmission and distribution systems. During fiscal year 2013, USDA
helped bring new and improved electric infrastructure to more than 80,000 Native
Americans and Alaska Natives and invested a record amount - $275 million - on
infrastructure projects benefitting them.

One of the many examples of how USDA investments are helping rural businesses
and communities is the bio-based startup company Laurel Biocomposites, LLC, in
Laurel, Neb. USDA partnered with Security Bank in Laurel to provide a $5 million
loan guarantee that helped Laurel Biocomposites buy equipment and provide
working capital for its first year of operation. Today, the company is operating
one production line and is expected to begin full-scale production later this
year. When full-scale production begins, the company plans to double its work
force from seven currently to 13 to 15 workers on the plant floor.

The Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative in Madison, Wis., is using a $150,000 USDA
Value Added Producer Grant to help start a regional fresh produce food hub and
packinghouse to improve producers' access to local wholesale markets. The hub
will create private-sector jobs and aggregate local produce sold under the
"Wisconsin Farmed" brand.

Eleven families in Reedley, Calif., became homeowners in 2013 after moving into
houses they jointly built through USDA's Mutual Self-Help Housing program. The
group worked with oversight from Self-Help Enterprises, a pioneer in the "Sweat
Equity" concept of homebuilding.

LENGTH: 860 words


Worcester State University recently celebrated the legacy of Professor Emeritus
Melvin Merken, who retired in 2010 after 52 years of service, at its 18th annual
Scholarship Tea.

Mr. Merken joined Worcester State Teachers College's Chemistry Department in
1958 after several years as a high school science teacher. A graduate of Tufts
University, he was named a full professor in 1967 after earning a doctorate from
Boston University. Over the years, he served as chairman of the department of
chemistry and physics, and department of natural and earth sciences.

Mr. Merken also chaired WSU's Curriculum Committee for 30 years. In that
capacity he was intimately involved in the development of many university
programs.

He is a Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science and
the American Institute of Chemists and a member of a number of professional
organizations.

He received an Educator of the Year Award from the Central Mass. Chapter, Phi
Delta Kappa in 2002, the Commonwealth Citation for Outstanding Performance in
1989 and 1996, and the Distinguished Service Award from Worcester State in 1980,
1984 and 1988.

Mr. Merken and his wife, Shirley Stahl Merken '96 - to whom he became engaged
just two weeks after they met on a blind date in 1956 - raised their three
children in a house within walking distance of WSU. They demonstrated their
ongoing commitment to Worcester State's students by establishing two
scholarships: the Dr. Melvin and Shirley Stahl Merken Two Cultures Scholarship
and the Arlyn Stahl Berlin Scholarship.

Mr. Merken said on his retirement, "After 52 years, I could sincerely say that I
loved what I did and never regretted that I did not retire sooner."

Sharon Eichorn has been named to the dean's list for the spring semester at the
Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.

Students from North High School and Worcester Vocational Technical High School
recently participated in the Health Occupations Student of America State
Leadership Conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Area Health Education
Center Network at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.

More than 170 students attended the conference, and most competed in one of 18
health care skills and were judged by teams of health care professionals.
Placing in the top three for a competitive event qualified students to advance
to the HOSA national competition this month in Orlando, Fla.

Among the top winners was Worcester Tech junior Paula Machado for Veterinary
Science.

At North, the top three winners of Concepts of Health Care were seniors
Francisco Crisostoma and Mercy Frimpong, and sophomore Anh Vo. Senior D'Aven

Akuffo, both juniors, won second place in Career Health Display.

U.S. Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Worcester, is the recipient of Worcester
Academy's 2012 Distinguished Alumnus Award.

After graduating from the academy in 1977, Mr. McGovern earned his B.A. and
Master's of Public Administration degrees from the American University, working
his way through college by serving as an aide in the office of U.S. Sen. George
McGovern. He also managed Sen. McGovern's 1984 presidential campaign. He then
spent 14 years as senior aide for the late U.S. Rep. John Joseph Moakley.

Now in his eighth term in Congress representing Central and Southeastern
Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern serves as a Senior Minority Whip; the second-ranking
Democrat on the House Rules Committee; and a member of the House Agriculture
Committee.

Worcester Academy also presented its 2012 Young Alumnus Recognition Award to
Philip Kalmanovitch, '02.

After graduating from the academy, Mr. Kalmanovitch attended Queen's University
in Kingston, Ontario, earning a B.A.H. in drama and a B.A. minor in music. In
2011, he received the Galaxie Musique Rising Star Award from the prestigious

YEAR IN REVIEW

NEAR-DEMISE OF $50 BILLION MORTGAGE COMPANY

HEADS SANTA FE'S TOP TEN STORIES OF 2007

The business of Santa Fe in 2007 ranged from big problems at the state's largest
publicly traded company, Thornburg Mortgage, to a guaranteed wage for almost all
of the city's workers and the promise of regional jet service offered by two
airlines, American Eagle and Delta. Here are the year's top ten stories:

1. THORNBURG -- The biggest story of the year -- a $50 billion one -- was the
disastrous decline and near demise of Thornburg Mortgage, which until August was
New Mexico's largest public company.

Following a collapse of the credit markets, Thornburg Mortgage, which is part of
Thornburg Companies, lost half its market value and saw its stock fall from
$18.06 on Aug. 10 to $7.61 on Aug. 14.

Even though Thornburg specialized in issuing jumbo mortgages to wealthy
borrowers, the company fell victim to the subprime crisis, in which lenders
extended mortgages to people with dubious credit histories.

As those loans faltered, banks and other lenders tightened loan requirements,
making it difficult or impossible for Thornburg and other lenders to borrow
money to originate new mortgages.

Thornburg Mortgage was forced to sell $20.5 billion of its safest investments at
a steep loss. The company also canceled its third-quarter dividend. In December,
Thornburg announced a fourth-quarter dividend of 25 cents per common share and
named former chief operating office Larry Goldstone as chief executive officer.

Thornburg Mortgage's stock closed out the year at $9.33. The stock's 52-week
high was $28.40 in May; the low was $7.49 in August. The company's assets fell
from

$50 billion to today's $35.2 billion.

Despite the problems at Thornburg Mortgage, Thornburg Companies went ahead with
construction of a planned 102,000-square-foot campus on North Ridgetop Road near
N.M. Mexico 599. That building is expected to open at the end of 2008.

2. MINIMUM WAGE -- Another big business story had more to do with small
businesses in Santa Fe -- starting Jan. 1, all Santa Fe businesses and not just
those with 25 or more employees have to pay a wage of $9.50 per hour.

That was the result of a deal worked out between city officials and business
leaders that avoided raising the minimum wage to $10.50 an hour in January of
this year.

Workers will receive pay increases in coming years based on the rise in the
consumer price index.

Many business people said the

$10.50 wage would have made it more difficult to do business in Santa Fe and
possibly forced some companies to go out of business.

An analysis by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at The University of
New Mexico showed the city's economy "has been performing well" since the
living-wage ordinance went into effect in 2004.

The state of New Mexico in 2007 passed a law that increased the statewide
minimum wage to $6.50 starting in January. That law exempts Santa Fe and
Albuquerque, which already have minimum-wage laws in effect.

3. BUSINESS ASSISTANCE -- Local business assistance groups had a busy year, with
the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce holding a membership drive that increased
members, the Santa Fe Business Incubator celebrating its

10th year in business and Santa Fe Economic Development announcing plans to
close.

About 160 chamber members took part in the drive, which were led by a
professional facilitator.

The chamber increased its membership by 273 members, for a total of 1,353.

Chamber president Simon Brackley said he was "very excited ... by people's
willingness to be involved in the business community."

The incubator, which provides services to energizing businesses, has served 64
client companies since its inception in 1997.

In 2007, the facility's tenants had revenues of more than $20 million, said CEO
Marie Longserre.

Santa Fe Economic Development, which has helped grow the business community for
two decades, said it was shutting down because of a lack of funding.

In July 1997, SFEDI, which was headed by Catherine Zacher, launched The Santa Fe
Plan: The Cluster Approach to Economic Gardening.

Economic gardening refers to the cultivation of businesses already in the
community and differs from economic hunting, which involves recruiting new
businesses to relocate to the community.

4. JET SERVICE -- America Eagle and Delta Airlines announced plans in 2007 to
bring regional jets to Santa Fe, with service to Dallas, Los Angeles and Salt
Lake City.

The two airlines are expected to start flying to Santa Fe in January and
February.

At the same time, Great Lakes Aviation, which has provided service from Santa Fe
to Denver and Albuquerque, will stop its flights on Monday. Great Lakes started
flying to Santa Fe from Denver in 1998.

Delta and American Eagle originally wanted to begin flying to Santa Fe in
December, but those plans were delayed because of problems with a Federal
Aviation Administration environmental assessment.

Mayor David Coss and the City Council are advocates of improved air service to
Santa Fe. That marks a turn-around from the policies of past administrations.

The Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce and the hospitality industry welcomed news of
the improved air service, and the chamber purchased a Web site, fly-santafe.net,
to promote air travel to Santa Fe and provide links to the airlines serving the
city.

5. RETAIL -- Santa Fe's retail industry was active in 2007, with the opening of
a Kohl's department store in October in Valdes Business Park one of the top
developments.

The reopening in the downtown area of Doodlet's pleased many shoppers,
especially since the 50-year-old store had been closed for almost two years for
renovation.

Also of importance was Whole Foods Markets' purchase in August of Wild Oats,
which initially left workers at Santa Fe's Wild Oats wondering what would happen
to them. But Whole Foods kept the local Wild Oats open and said it would upgrade
the 19,000-square-foot store on St. Francis Drive.

Not remaining open is Santa Fe Supermart, which unexpectedly shut its doors in
Rodeo Plaza shopping center due to a lack of business.

Also, a Florida firm purchased underoccupied Santa Fe Outlets and changed the
name to Fashion Outlets of Santa Fe. Talisman Companies wants to bring Polo and
Nike to the retail center by the spring of 2008.

Santa Fe Place, formerly Villa Linda Mall, also was sold and now is owned by
Babcock and Brown, a global investment company based in Sydney.

In other retail activity, Regal Stadium 14 movie theater opened in San Isidro
Village in April.

In the auto sector, auto dealer Don Chalmers bought the Capitol Ford Lincoln
Mercury franchise in the Santa Fe Auto Park. Chalmers also owns Don Chalmers
Cadillac Saab in Santa Fe.

6. REAL ESTATE -- Santa Fe real-estate sales remained relatively strong through
the first three quarters of the year but flagged in October and November, when
the median sales price dropped in the city.

The number of homes sold in the first quarter of 2007 was down 35 percent over
the same period in 2006, but the median sales price rose 15 percent to $354,125.

In the second quarter, the number of homes sold continued to fall, but the
median sales price rose again, to $403,000.

The median sales price in the third quarter was also up, to $349,500, but lower
than the median sales price in the second quarter. The number of city homes sold
in the third quarter was down 23 percent.

Fourth-quarter numbers won't be available until next week, but if November is
any indication, both the number of homes sold and the median sales price were
down in both the city and the county.

The city median sales price came in at $355,000, while the price in the county
was $428,278.

Realtors' expectation for 2008 range from very optimistic for a return of a
strong market to concern that it could be a flat year.

7. HEALTH CARE -- In the health care industry, St. Vincent Regional Medical
Center is exploring the formation of a partnership with Christus Health, one of
the country's largest health care systems, in an effort to cut debt and to allow
the hospital to expand to the city's fast-growing south side.

A decision is expected in February.

Christus, a Roman Catholic health system based in Irving, Texas, has more than
40 hospitals and other medical facilities in 70 cities in the U.S. and Mexico,
and about 29,000 employees.

The partnership was generally welcomed by St. Vincent workers, including
doctors.

There were some concerns that the merger with a Catholic institution such as
Christus would limit medical choices, including reproductive-health services and
end-of-life decisions.

St. Vincent has proposed forming a separate nonprofit called SVH Supportco to
insulate Christus from involvement in procedures that are not in keeping with
Catholic health practices.

8. CONSTRUCTION -- Construction abounded in and around Santa Fe in 2007, much of
it in the downtown area.

The largest project was the city of Santa Fe's conference center, at the corner
of Marcy Street and Grant Avenue. It's expected to be finished in the summer of
2008.

The Museum of New Mexico expansion project, on Lincoln Avenue, won't be done
until 2009.

Also downtown, renovation started on La Esquina building, across from City Hall
on Marcy Street at Lincoln Avenue. The New Mexican building on Marcy Street was
remodeled, and staff moved back in early August after more than a year at the
former White Swan building on Cerrillos Road.

Future construction projects include one by First National Bank and Greer
Enterprises in a space now occupied by the bank's parking lot between West San
Francisco Street and Palace Avenue.

Greer Enterprises is also proposing a project of its own -- Villas at the
Lensic, a retail and condominium project, also in a space now used by Greer as a
parking lot. It's at the intersection of Sandoval Street and West San Francisco
streets and Palace Avenue.

Villas at the Lensic came under criticism by the Business Capitol
District/Development Review Committee but received a conditional approval from
that panel.

Other major construction projects included Thornburg's new campus off N.M. 599
and Pojoaque Pueblo's casino/hotel in Pojoaque.

9. LODGING INDUSTRY -- No new hotels opened in Santa Fe in 2007, but Encantado,
a luxury property on the site of the former Rancho Encantado, will open for
business in July.

The property features 65 casitas in what the owner Auberge Resorts calls a
"world-class spa" with 15 treatment rooms. The hotel also features a restaurant
and lounge, all on 57 acres of land in Tesuque. A fitness center and yoga studio
are also planned.

In another hotel development, The Inn and Spa at Loretto was acquired by Lowe
Enterprises, a national real-estate investment, development and management firm
based in Los Angeles.

The 134-room hotel sold for

$47.5 million.

Also, a partnership led by the Gencom Group purchased the

157-room La Posada de Santa Fe for an undisclosed amount.

RockResorts remains the management company at La Posada.

At year's end, Corporacion de La Fonda, parent company of La Fonda, and The
Peters Corp. announced a plan whereby La Fonda would buy all stock in the hotel
holding company owned by Gerald and Kathleen Peters and The Peters Corp.

The Peters group had owned stock in La Fonda since 1985.

10. RESTAURANTS -- The restaurant industry was busy again in 2007. Among the
restaurants opening were Amavi on Shelby Street and La Boca on Marcy Street

Yummy Cafe, a Chinese restaurant, opened in St. Michael's Village West shopping
center, and Celebrations moved from Canyon Road to the same center.

Miklo's Coffee House was the first business to open in Tierra Contenta's
commercial space, Plaza Contenta. Restaurants opening in San Isidro Village
included Josh's Barbecue, Wild Wild Wok and Patsy's New York Pizza. Back Road
Pizza opened a second location in Turquoise Trail Business Park

The Pink Adobe reopened under new ownership following the sale of the property
by the Hoback family to the Garrett Hotel Group. Close by, the Rio Chama
Steakhouse completed a remodel.

The Little House Chinese restaurant moved to a restaurant space in the College
Plaza South shopping center.

The food court at Santa Fe Place took a hit with the closing of Ichi Bon Express
and The Big Enchilada. Only Famous Wok, Dairy Queen and Sbarro Italian Eatery
remains.

Among other restaurants that closed were Fox's Upstairs Bar and Grill off

St. Michael's Drive, Señor Lucky's at the Place in downtown Santa Fe and Red
Skye Grill on Old Pecos Trail.

Founder of free health clinic dies

Willa Livingston Carson, a nurse, teacher and founder in 1996 of the North
Greenwood Community Health Resource Center, died Friday (April 14, 2006).

Mrs. Carson, 80, of Clearwater, died of a heart attack in her apartment at On
Top of the World, her daughter said.

Mrs. Carson was well known for her contributions to health care, particularly in
the predominantly black neighborhood in Clearwater. The Health Resource Center,
a free clinic which she once ran from two converted apartments, was recently
renamed the Willa L. Carson Health Resource Center.

Mrs. Carson was a tireless advocate for the clinic, now at 1108 N Greenwood Ave.
She missed no opportunity to raise money, awareness or to solicit doctors' help.

Last year, as she accepted a Points of Light Award from Gov. Jeb Bush, she said:
"I think people are recognizing us now because at the center we see over 600
patients a month."

Then she added that while the honor was fine, she wished it came with some sort
of grant money for the clinic.

Mrs. Carson also received a National Conference for Community and Justice's
Silver Medallion Humanitarian Award and a Liberty Bell Award from the Clearwater
Bar Association.

She was born in St. Petersburg, leaving in 1938 to attend school in Daytona
Beach.

She married Ernest Lee Carson and lived in New York City, where she earned her
practical nursing license and worked many years at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center. She later joined the Visiting Nurse Service.

She came to Clearwater in 1972, after her husband retired from Postal Service in
New York City and she retired as a nurse.

Mrs. Carson was unsatisfied with retirement. She wanted to continue in nursing
and to give back to the community.

She first earned a registered nursing degree from St. Petersburg College and a
master's degree from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. She then
began her second career as a teacher.

Her only child, Ernestine Carson Heaster of Vienna, Va., recalled that when her
mother had a heart attack in 2001 how many nurses at Morton Plant Hospital knew
her.

"I already knew that when Mom taught at St. Petersburg College, she was always
reaching out and helping the student nurses - she organized the Friends of
Nursing at the school to raise money for loans and grants. So I guess it wasn't
surprising that there at the hospital in 2001, I kept running into so many
nurses who were former students of hers."

Ms. Heaster recalled one nurse in particular.

"When she was in school, this nurse only spoke English as a second language. She
frustrated when after having made three unsuccessful trips to Tallahassee to
secure her license, she kept getting lost due to the language barrier. When Mom
found out, she just took over - she had Dad drive her and the student nurse to
Tallahassee to get the license.

"Now here it was, years later at the hospital, that I ran into this nurse again
- I was constantly running into people she was involved in helping."

Mrs. Carson was an active member of Mount Carmel Baptist Church, Clearwater,
Delta Sigma Theta, and The Links.

Along with her daughter, survivors include two grandchildren and a
great-grandchild. Her husband died in 2000 after 57 years of marriage. Viewing
will be from 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at Mount Carmel Baptist Church, 1014
Pennsylvania Ave., Clearwater, with funeral services at 11 a.m. Thursday at the
church. Burial will be at Florida National Cemetery, Bushnell.

Donations may be sent to the Willa L. Carson Health Resource Center, 1108 N
Martin Luther King Ave., Clearwater 33755.

Young's Funeral Home, Clearwater, is handling arrangements.

Rhode Island: Businesses voice stiff opposition to lease proposal

LENGTH: 1229  words

DATELINE: Providence


American Institute of CPAs, The State of Rhode Island has issued the following
press release:

The converged proposal on financial reporting for leases faces significant
opposition from businesses from around the globe.

Friday was the final day for the public to submit comment letters on the
reproposal to FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). An
analysis of comment letters on the proposed standard submitted by business and
industry respondents that would be considered financial statement preparers
(excluding accounting firms) revealed little support and substantial opposition
to the proposal.

Of the 268 letters analyzed, 212 expressed a decidedly negative opinion of the
proposal, which would place leases on the balance sheet and create a
dual-recognition model for lessees. Just 25 letters indicated substantial
support for the proposal, and 31 letters did not express a clear positive or
negative overall opinion of the proposal. Additional letters continued to be
posted to FASB's site after this analysis; as of Wednesday morning (Eastern time
in the United States), 528 comment letters had been posted.

The objections from businesses came from various industries and nations:

China Telecom said the standard is difficult to understand, apply, and
implement, and that the differences between lessor and lessee accounting are
logically unsound.
    Swiss oil and gas offshore drilling contractor Noble Corp. said the proposal
introduces unnecessary judgments and complexity into revenue recognition, and
reduces transparency and comparability of information.
    Finnish banking company FFFS said the proposal is unnecessarily complex,
will not improve transparency, and does not reflect the economics of leases.
    U.S. retailer Dollar General said the proposal does not solve the problems
with complexity and lack of comparability that exist in current lease
accounting.
    Wesfarmers Limited, one of Australia's largest listed companies with
operations in retail, mining, insurance, chemicals, and energy, said IAS 17
should be retained for leases because on-balance-sheet recognition of leases
(including property) is conceptually inconsistent with the accounting treatment
of economically similar arrangements.
    North American railcar manufacturing and leasing company Trinity Industries
stated its objections in bold, underlined type: "[W]e do not agree with the
changes that are proposed in the Exposure Draft."
    Delta Airlines noted that former IASB Chairman Sir David Tweedie once said
that one of his ambitions is to fly in an aircraft that is on an airline's
balance sheet. But Delta concluded that although the ED is consistent with
Tweedie's objective, the benefits of this particular proposal do not outweigh
the costs.


John Hepp, CPA, a partner in Grant Thornton's National Professional Standards
Group, said the opposition will make it difficult for the boards to move forward
with the proposal. He said there's a possibility the IASB would move forward,
although he predicted the model would be aligned more closely with the original
2010 ED if the IASB does move ahead alone with an approach that is not
converged.

"I have a hard time seeing the FASB going forward," Hepp said. "... Would they
be able to get four votes to go forward with the current exposure draft? It's
touch and go. It would depend on, what's the alternative. If the alternative
would be to just abandon the project, maybe."

FASB voted 4-3 to issue the proposal for exposure. But former FASB Chairman
Leslie Seidman, who voted in favor of issuing the ED, has retired from the
board; her spot on the board is now occupied by former SEC Chief Accountant
James Kroeker. FASB's own Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) also has opposed the
proposal.

The proposal calls for lessees to report a straight-line lease expense in their
income statement for most real estate leases. In most equipment and vehicle
leases, lessees would recognize a lease as a nonfinancial asset measured at
cost, less amortization. This would result in a total lease expense that
generally would decrease over the lease term

The boards have expressed a desire to have a final standard in place by 2014,
although implementation is not expected to occur earlier than fiscal years
beginning Jan. 1, 2017.

Common objections expressed in the comment letters included:

Complexity and increased costs for preparers. "Industrywide in the United
States, we believe this change will probably cost preparers hundreds of millions
dollars if not over a billion dollars to implement and annually maintain records
for this proposed accounting standard," wrote U.S. health care company Allergan.

    Lack of significant improvements for financial statement users. "The limited
benefit for sophisticated users does not justify the tremendous cost of
implementation when there is virtually no benefit for unsophisticated users,"
said U.S. diversified energy company PNM Resources.
    Failure of the proposal to faithfully represent the economics of leasing.
The right-of-use asset concept "distorts the reporting of the economics of the
operating lease bargain," wrote U.S. finance corporation Residco.


A popular alternative method suggested by many commenters is to improve
transparency through simply using current standards with enhanced disclosures.

"We feel that enhanced disclosure requirements alone can sufficiently address
the concerns with current lease accounting," said U.S., U.K., and Canadian truck
leasing service Ryder.

The enhanced disclosures tactic also was advocated by the IAC--FASB's investor
advisory group. But keeping the current standards in place fails to achieve one
of the objectives of the project, which is creating international convergence of
the FASB and IASB standards.

Some businesses with international operations are eager for the consistency that
a converged standard could deliver.

"We believe it is critical that the boards develop full convergence for all
aspects of accounting for leases," Ford Motor Co. said in its comment letter.

Some objections were expressed to the proposal's suggestions to bring leases
onto the balance sheet and use a dual-recognition approach, although many
commenters also supported those concepts. The proposal also did receive some
support.

U.K. and Finnish independent regional airline group Flybe indicated its broad
support because it said the proposal removes inconsistencies and anomalies,
achieving a greater consistency for lease arrangements.
    Chinese oil and gas producer Petrochina said the proposal will provide users
with more objective information--but called on the boards to simplify
presentation and disclosure to reduce complexity and costs.
    U.S.-based Washington Real Estate Investment Trust said the revised proposal
adequately addressed its concerns with the original proposal.


But even some companies that expressed a positive view of the proposal asked for
additional time for transition. And many of the comments were similar to those
of global oil and gas company Chevron.

"[T]he boards have gone well beyond the original objective of improving
transparency around lease obligations, resulting in unnecessary complexity and
excessive costs for financial statement preparers, with little resulting benefit
for financial statement users," Chevron said.

TEXT:
 [*173]

    A recent article in a prominent dental journal chronicles the case of a
fifty-four year old woman in desperate need of dental care.  n1 Despite having
basic insurance coverage for dental care through her husband's part-time job,
the woman could not afford the steep copayment required by the dental insurer in
order to obtain services.  n2 As a direct result of forgoing necessary dental
care for a serious oral health condition, the woman was eventually hospitalized.

    The patient's dentist was willing to perform the treatment and waive the
cost-sharing amount, accepting the third-party coverage as payment in full. He
made repeated attempts to persuade the dental insurer to allow him to provide
the services under such an arrangement, but the insurer refused. The dental
insurer suggested instead that the dentist simply provide the care at no cost.
n3

    Although cost sharing in the form of deductibles and copayments is common
among health and dental insurers to limit unnecessary utilization of services,
it can impose substantial barriers to access to care for patients with limited
financial [*174]  means. In fact, out-of-pocket costs often represent the
determining factor in deciding among dental or medical treatment options,
irrespective of efficacy or quality.  n4 Medical care providers frequently waive
copayment requirements for patients who could not otherwise afford treatment.
Most dental insurers and a handful of states, however, expressly forbid this
practice among dentists.  n5

    In response to the problem of underinsured dental patients and the ban that
many dental insurers place on waiver of copayments, the SmileCare Dental Group
of Irvine, California, developed an innovative insurance product known as
"supplemental dental care plans."  n6 These plans, offered to employers, labor
unions, and individuals, were modeled after supplemental insurance products
purchased by Medicare beneficiaries and were designed to offset the
out-of-pocket costs not covered by a subscriber's primary dental insurance.  n7
The supplemental insurance coverage relieves patients of copayments for
services, since the supplemental insurer pays this portion of the bill directly
to providers.  n8

    Immediately following the introduction of this new dental insurance product,
Delta Dental Plan of California, the state's predominant dental insurer,
retaliated by instituting a new policy prohibiting its participating providers
from accepting supplemental payments from SmileCare.  n9 Delta Dental deemed any
provider who violated this policy in breach of contract. As a penalty for
breach, providers faced reduced fees, threats of termination, or actual
termination.  n10 With a sixty percent market share for dental insurance and a
participation rate of ninety-five percent by California dentists, Delta Dental's
policy greatly affected SmileCare's business. SmileCare responded by filing a
claim against Delta Dental.  [*175]

    In SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of California,  n11 SmileCare
alleged that Delta Dental violated section 2 of the Sherman Act.  n12 According
to SmileCare, Delta Dental engaged in intentional predatory or anticompetitive
conduct and characterized Delta Dental's practice as a "group boycott." The
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the lower court's
dismissal of SmileCare's complaint for failure to state a claim.  n13

    The SmileCare case is unique because it is the first to examine whether a
primary insurer's policy of prohibiting providers from accepting supplemental
payments in lieu of patient copayments violates antitrust laws. The judicial
affirmation of Delta Dental's policy has significant implications for the dental
insurance industry and, potentially, for other markets like the Medigap market
for Medicare supplemental insurance.

    This Comment maintains that the circuit court in SmileCare wrongly upheld
the dismissal of SmileCare's complaint against Delta Dental. Part I examines the
market for dental care services and recent antitrust enforcement activity in the
health care industry. Part II discusses the circuit court's reasoning and
holding in the SmileCare case. Part III argues that the court misconstrued the
application of SmileCare's group-boycott claim and erred in considering Delta
Dental's "business justification" for its policy prior to determining whether
Delta Dental engaged in anticompetitive and predatory conduct. This Comment
concludes that SmileCare represents an unwarranted departure from accepted
principles in antitrust jurisprudence but does not signify a major shift in
evaluating antitrust cases in the supplemental insurance industry or the health
care market as a whole.


   I. USE OF DENTAL SERVICES AND ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT IN THE HEALTH CARE
INDUSTRY

   A. The Demand for and Use of Dental Services

 The growth of dental insurance over the past twenty-five years  n14 has caused
a concurrent increase in the use of dental  [*176]  services.  n15 Private
dental plans currently cover an estimated forty percent of the U.S. population.
n16 Studies show that those with dental insurance, regardless of the level of
coverage, use dental services more often and seek preventive care more
frequently as compared to those who lack insurance.  n17 In fact, those without
dental insurance usually seek care only on an emergency basis.  n18

    Although insurance may improve access to dental care, it does not
necessarily create the same "moral hazard," or over-consumption, that prevails
in other sectors of the health care [*177]  industry.  n19 Because the price
elasticity of demand  n20 for dental care is relatively small,  n21 additional
insurance coverage will not necessarily lead to an increase in the use of
services.  n22 This observation is particularly accurate for dental services
other than basic preventive services such as oral exams and prophylactic [*178]
care.  n23 For example, nonprice factors may influence the demand for
restorative, periodontic, endodontic, and surgical dental services such as root
canals, dentures, and amalgams.  n24 Moreover, like the demand for medical care,
providers play an influential role in determining demand for dental services,
n25 which further reduces the importance of price in determining a patient's
choice of care.

    Copayments provide one solution for preventing over-consumption of services.
For some individuals, however, cost-sharing obligations may still pose a
financial barrier to obtaining necessary dental care despite insurance coverage.
n26 Many dental plans have maximum annual limits that are too low to cover
comprehensive treatment or deductibles and demand copayments which keep access
to care out of the financial reach of patients.  n27 Although full-coverage
dental insurance does not require out-of-pocket payments, such plan options are
often considerably more expensive than a dental plan with less than 100%
coverage.  n28

    In response to financial concerns of patients, providers sometimes elect to
waive copayments for their patients and accept the insurance reimbursement as
payment in full. Providers may also waive copayments in order to attract
business. Most insurers, as well as the American Dental Association and Delta
Dental Plans Association,  n29 oppose the practice of waiving co-  [*179]
payments because it increases the moral hazard of insurance.  n30 Moreover,
several states currently ban waiver of copayments, and courts have upheld such
restrictions on dentists as a valid business practice in the insurance industry.
n31 As a result, a [*180]  vigorous debate has ensued within the dental
profession over whether or not waiver of copayments is ethical.  n32

    Patients for whom full coverage is prohibitively expensive or unavailable
may purchase supplemental insurance to provide coverage for deductibles and
copayment amounts. The market for supplemental health insurance is particularly
prominent among Medicare beneficiaries who purchase such coverage to offset
out-of-pocket costs not covered under Medicare.  n33 In fact, over twenty-two
million elderly, or seventy-five percent of all Medicare beneficiaries, carry
Medicare Supplemental Insurance, also known as Medigap, coverage.  n34

    Several factors distinguish the dental industry from the rest of the medical
industry. For example, dental insurance is much less common among the U.S.
population than health insurance.  n35 Practices that are accepted in the health
industry, such as waiver of copayments, are not prevalent in the dental
industry.  n36 In fact, according to one estimate, approximately  [*181]
twenty-three percent of patients with traditional fee-for-service insurance have
benefited from a waiver of copayment by their medical provider,  n37 even though
dental providers are forbidden from engaging in the same practice. Additionally,
supplemental insurance is not as widely available or as common in the dental
industry as it is in other sectors of the health insurance industry, especially
the Medicare beneficiary market.

   B. Antitrust Enforcement in the Health Care Industry

 The Sherman Act,  n38 the Clayton Act,  n39 the Robinson-Patman Act,  n40 and
the Federal Trade Commission Act  n41 represent the foundation of federal
antitrust laws. The statutory framework of these antitrust provisions has
remained rela-  [*182]  tively static since 1950.  n42 In contrast, the health
care industry has undergone substantial change with regard to financing and
delivery of care.  n43 Antitrust enforcement in health care has evolved to adapt
to these myriad changes.

    Since the 1970s, when the Supreme Court first demonstrated a willingness to
apply federal antitrust laws to health care financing and delivery arrangements,
n44 the health care in-  [*183]  dustry has experienced a flurry of antitrust
enforcement activity.  n45 In particular, both the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have vigorously investigated and
enforced antitrust provisions as the health care market has consolidated through
vertical integration, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions.  n46 The
stated objective of the FTC has been to prevent market concentration and
unreasonable restraints on competition in order to preserve consumer choice.
n47

    Regardless of the precise nature of the antitrust claim, courts have
traditionally held that an antitrust complaint should not be dismissed for
failure to state a claim unless appears behond doubt that plaintiff can prove no
set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."  n48
Anti-  [*184]  trust litigation is not, however, exempt from the provisions of
Rules 12(b)(6) and 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Indeed, a recent
Supreme Court case even casts doubt on the notion that courts disfavor summary
judgment in antitrust claims. In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp.,  n49 the Court held that summary dismissal is justified when the
factual context of a plaintiff's claim is implausible or makes no economic
sense.  n50 Scholars have questioned whether Matsushita really established a new
standard for summary dismissal in antitrust cases,  n51 however, and courts
continue to demonstrate an unwillingness to dismiss cases based on the rationale
of earlier, more traditional cases.  n52

    Another consideration in the debate over summary dismissal of antitrust
claims is the treble-damages provision of the Clayton Act.  n53 While the goals
of the treble-damages rem-  [*185]  edy in private actions are admirable,  n54
many commentators argue that treble damages create inefficiency, encourage
meritless suits, and cause overdeterrence.  n55 Appropriate use of summary
dismissal can effectively curb nuisance suits and the misuse of private
antitrust actions for strategic purposes.

    Several types of antitrust challenges relate particularly to the health care
context: monopolization, attempted monopolization, and horizontal restraints of
trade in the form of coercive group boycotts.


   1. Monopolization

 To state a valid monopolization claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act, a
private plaintiff must allege: (1) possession of monopoly power in the relevant
market, (2) willful acquisition or maintenance of that power, and (3) causal
antitrust injury.  n56

    Under the first element, a court will examine whether the defendant has
monopoly power. The Supreme Court defines monopoly power as "the power to
control prices or exclude competition" within a relevant market.  n57 To
identify monopoly power, a plaintiff must first provide proof of a relevant
market. This analysis involves two aspects: a relevant product market, which
includes products that are "reasonably interchangeable" with the product
allegedly monopolized, and a relevant geographic market, the geographic area in
which the sellers compete for consumers.  n58 Under some circumstances,
predominant market [*186]  share may be used to infer monopoly power.  n59 The
difficulty with this approach, however, lies in determining what level of market
share constitutes a predominant share.  n60

    To establish the second element of a monopolization claim, "willful
acquisition or maintenance of monopoly power," the plaintiff must allege
"predatory," "anticompetitive," or "exclusionary" conduct.  n61 Examples of
predatory conduct include price squeezing and predatory pricing.  n62 Numerous
court cases involving a monopolization claim revolve around whether a particular
market structure is the result of prohibited monopolistic behavior or the
consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.  n63

    With regard to the final element, in order to demonstrate an antitrust
injury, a plaintiff must show that its injury was [*187]  caused by the
predatory conduct, not by competition.  n64 More specifically, a plaintiff must
prove that the injury is "of the type the antitrust laws were intended to
prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."  n65

   2. Attempted Monopolization

 The attempt-to-monopolize offense is designed to discourage unilateral activity
that poses a threat to competition such that, if left unchecked, would result in
the acquisition of monopoly power.  n66 A claim by a private plaintiff for
attempted monopolization, which also falls under section 2 of the Sherman Act,
n67 entails four elements: (1) specific intent to control prices or destroy
competition, (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct to accomplish the
monopolization, (3) dangerous probability of success, and (4) causal antitrust
injury.  n68

    Specific intent and anticompetitive conduct are essential elements of an
attempt claim.  n69 Proof of intent to prevail over competitors by improper
means can be demonstrated through direct or indirect evidence but a "dangerous
probability of success" also must be demonstrated.  n70 The Supreme Court firmly
established that this element requires an inquiry into relevant product and
geographic markets and an analysis of a defendant's economic power in that
market.  n71 In Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, the Supreme Court rejected
an approach used by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that held parties in
[*188]  violation of the "attempt" provisions of the Sherman Act without such an
assessment of market power.  n72

   3. Refusal to Deal

 In general, competitors need not deal with one another.  n73 This freedom to
associate, however, is not absolute. In some circumstances, a competitor may be
liable for abuse of its market power for refusing to deal without an adequate
business justification.  n74 Indeed, an affirmative duty to deal exists under
narrow circumstances and is imposed only when the defendant possesses monopoly
power over the product.  n75 Whether the product is competitively essential is
also important, but a defendant can prevail nonetheless if it had a valid,
efficiency-enhancing reason for refusing to deal.  n76

   4. Group Boycotts

 Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits conduct in which an agreement is made
among competitors not to deal with third parties.  n77 Such behavior is often
referred to as a group boycott or a horizontal refusal to deal.  n78 Early
examples of [*189]  group boycotts in a health care context involved attempts by
physicians to shut out alternative providers or exclude new types of health
plans or financing schemes such as prepaid capitation.  n79

    Although group boycotts are traditionally regarded as a per se antitrust
offense when there is market power or control of an essential facility,  n80
depending on how an alleged boycott is structured, courts may apply the "rule of
reason" analysis instead. A practice that would always or almost always tend to
restrict competition and decrease output will be treated as a per se violation
of the antitrust laws.  n81 Such practices are presumed [*190]  illegal, and the
court will not engage in an elaborate balancing test between the precise harm
incurred and the pro-competitive effects of the practice.  n82

    Under a rule of reason analysis, which applies to the majority of antitrust
cases,  n83 courts will consider: (1) the market or markets involved, and (2) a
determination of whether the acts or practices unreasonably affect competition.
n84 Courts have demonstrated a reluctance to condemn rules adopted by
professional associations as unreasonable per se.  n85 As the Supreme Court has
explained, "we have been slow to condemn rules adopted by professional
associations as unreasonable per se and, in general, to extend per se analysis
to restraints imposed in the context of business relationships where the
economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious."  n86

   II. SMILECARE DENTAL GROUP V. DELTA DENTAL PLAN OF CALIFORNIA

 In SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of California,  n87 the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took the controversial step of
affirming the lower court's [*191]  dismissal of the plaintiff's antitrust
complaint  n88 for failure to state a claim.  n89 The SmileCare court reached
its decision by accepting the lower court's conclusion that Delta Dental's
policy of prohibiting supplemental insurance payments did not have any
anticompetitive effects and that the policy represented a legitimate business
practice.  n90 Further, the court affirmed the lower court's dismissal of
SmileCare's group boycott claim on the grounds that Delta Dental was not engaged
in a conspiracy.  n91

   A. Anticompetitive Effects of Delta Dental's Policy

 In its complaint, SmileCare alleged that Delta Dental possessed market power in
the dental insurance market by virtue of its sixty percent market share for
dental insurance in the state and its nonexclusive contractual relationship with
ninety-five percent of California dentists.  n92 SmileCare also alleged that
Delta Dental's policy prohibiting supplemental insurance payments was calculated
to eliminate SmileCare's dental plans [*192]  from the market and maintain its
dominant market position.  n93 The court declined to address the issue of market
power and disregarded SmileCare's allegations of antitrust injury.  n94 Instead,
the primary issue on appeal, according to the court, was whether Delta Dental's
policy of prohibiting providers from accepting copayments from supplemental
insurers had any anticompetitive effects.  n95

    In reaching its conclusion that the policy did not, in fact, have any
impermissible anticompetitive effects, the court made two findings. First, on
the basis of the lower court's analysis and precedent, the court found the
copayment policy valid.  n96 Second, the court affirmed the lower court's
finding that the parties were not true competitors because SmileCare's "Coverage
Plus" supplemental plan did not compete with Delta Dental's primary plan.

   1. The Validity and Merits of Copayment Plans

 The SmileCare court seemed to accept the argument that insurance creates a
"moral hazard" by desensitizing patients to the cost of care, thereby inducing
them to seek more care than they would if the services were not covered.  n97
Despite approval [*193]  of the actuarial soundness of SmileCare's supplemental
dental plan by the California Department of Corporations,  n98 the court noted
the economic validity of mandatory copayments because they offset the adverse
economic effect of insurance.  n99 Mandatory cost-sharing is also legally valid,
the court found, because various cases have upheld the use of copayments to hold
down the cost of medical care.  n100 Based on these principles, the court in
dicta recognized that payments made directly to dental providers were equivalent
to a waiver of copayments and could therefore be prohibited.  n101  [*194]


   2. SmileCare and Delta Dental as Competitors

 The court provided a second reason for denying SmileCare's allegations that
Delta Dental's policy was anticompetitive: the parties were not competitors.
n102 In reaching this conclusion, the SmileCare court reiterated the lower
court's finding, which rejected SmileCare's argument that its "Coverage Plus"
supplemental plan, combined with Delta Dental's primary plan, was in competition
with Delta Dental's full coverage plan.  n103 According to the court, as a
matter of law, the definition of competitor precluded Delta Dental from
competing with itself.  n104 Hence, as long as Delta Dental did not act to
[*195]  crush its competition in the primary plan market, it did not act
anticompetitively.  n105

   B. Delta Dental's Legitimate Business Interest

 In response to SmileCare's antitrust claim for "refusal to deal,"  n106 the
court concluded that even if the parties were competitors, the claim should be
dismissed on the basis of Delta Dental's "valid business reason."  n107 The
court noted that al-  [*196]  though the existence of a valid business reason
for prohibiting supplemental plans was normally a question of fact, based on its
preceding analysis regarding the validity of mandatory copayment plans, Delta
Dental's legitimate business reason was "a foregone conclusion requiring no
further analysis."  n108 Moreover, the court noted that Delta Dental's primary
plan predated SmileCare's supplemental plan.  n109 More specifically, the
SmileCare court accepted the lower court's finding that Delta Dental did not
discontinue an existing arrangement or implement its policy prohibiting waiver
of copayments in response to SmileCare's supplemental plan.  n110

   C. Lack of Conspiracy to Establish a Group Boycott

 Finally, in dismissing SmileCare's group boycott claim, the court reasoned that
SmileCare failed to allege the essential element of a conspiracy between Delta
Dental and another party.  n111 While SmileCare cited Klor's Inc. v.
Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.  n112 to support its claim that Delta Dental used its
market power to induce dentists to "boycott" SmileCare's supplemental plans,
n113 the court distinguished Klor's on the  [*197]  ground that Delta Dental's
policy was actually procompetitive rather than anticompetitive and because the
parties in this case were not competitors.  n114

   III. SMILECARE: QUASHING A LEGITIMATE ANTITRUST CLAIM

   A. Assessing Antitrust Claims in the Dental Insurance Industry

 The SmileCare decision takes antitrust enforcement in health care back twenty
years to a time when courts gave the industry a substantial amount of deference.
n115 In light of recent changes in the U.S. health care system with regard to
financing and delivery arrangements,  n116 courts are now generally more willing
to examine the activities and conduct of insurers and providers.  n117 The
dental industry and the supplemental insurance industry are no exception.  n118

    Recent Supreme Court cases cast doubt on the traditional view that federal
antitrust claims are subject to a higher standard of review for summary
dismissal motions than other claims.  n119 The potential for high costs
associated with discov-  [*198]  ery and the incentive for meritless suits that
accompanies the treble-damages remedy  n120 may seem to justify enthusiastic
application of the summary dismissal tools set forth in the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. The standard for dismissing an antitrust claim is not lower
than it is for other claims, however. The Supreme Court has held that such
claims should be dismissed only if the factual context of a plaintiff's claim is
implausible or makes no economic sense.  n121 Thus, if the standard of review
for antitrust cases is equivalent to that applied in other contexts, a
plaintiff's allegations set forth in the complaint should be read broadly and
liberally.  n122

    In SmileCare, however, rather than accepting the plaintiff's allegations as
true and applying the standard of review required in considering a Rule 12(b)(6)
motion, the court rejected the claim and, instead, embraced Delta Dental's
affirmative defense.  n123 That Delta Dental's policy of prohibiting
supplemental insurance would both eliminate consumer choice for full dental
insurance coverage and "stamp out" all competition for such coverage should have
alerted the court to potential anticompetitive conduct.

   B. SmileCare's Claim Should have Survived Dismissal

 The SmileCare court erroneously upheld the dismissal of SmileCare's antitrust
action. Because SmileCare alleged predatory conduct with enough sufficiency,
according to the generally accepted standard of review in antitrust cases,
SmileCare's complaint should have survived a motion to dismiss for failure to
state a claim. In addition, instead of acknowledging the importance of Delta
Dental's market share for dental insurance and the fact that the insurer
contracts with [*199]  nearly 100% of the providers in California,  n124 the
court mistakenly focused on Delta Dental's defense to the claim and the validity
of copayment plans. Finally, in its high-handed approach toward supplemental
insurance for dental care, the court ignored the widely accepted market for
supplemental insurance in other sectors of the health care industry.  n125

   1. The Court Erred in Basing its Decision on the Lower Court's "Finding" that
Delta Dental's Policy Had No Anticompetitive Effect

 The Ninth Circuit's decision to affirm the dismissal of SmileCare's antitrust
claims centered on the court's "finding" that Delta Dental's policy had no
anticompetitive effects.  n126 In reaching this decision, the court reasoned
that the parties to this action were not competitors,  n127 and that because
policies prohibiting waivers of copayments were economically and legally valid,
prohibitions against supplemental insurance payments were correspondingly valid.
n128

    In light of the procedural posture of the case,  n129 the court's
determination that Delta Dental's policy had no anticompetitive effect was
incorrect for two reasons. First, in evaluating the prohibition of copayment
waivers, the majority relied on cases interpreting the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) rather than the Sherman Act.  n130 The ERISA cases
are irrelevant to the SmileCare case, because ERISA protects [*200]  employee
benefits, whereas antitrust laws protect competition and consumer choice.
Although no previous cases had considered the validity of copayment plans in an
action under the Sherman Act, the court placed undue reliance on cases decided
within a different statutory framework.

    Second, the court improperly equated waivers of copayment with supplementary
insurance payments.  n131 The court's conclusion ignored the existence and
legitimacy of supplemental insurance in other sectors of the health care
industry and the position of the California Attorney General that such waivers
are acceptable under state law.  n132 Ironically, Delta Dental admitted that it
would not oppose the supplemental payments if they were made to patients who
would then mail a check to their dentist.  n133 Under this arrangement,
according to Delta, patients must "consider the pinch to their own wallets."
n134 This assertion makes no sense if Delta truly desires to sensitize patients
to the cost of care, because patients pay the cost of care in form only and not
in substance. In sum, the court's analysis that supplemental insurance plans
were objectionable, not because they insulated patients from out-of-pocket costs
but because they paid providers directly rather than indirectly, contradicts the
assertion that supplementary insurance payments are equivalent to waivers of
copayment.

    The court also erred in finding that the parties do not compete against each
other. Although SmileCare may not compete with Delta Dental in the market for
partial coverage that includes cost sharing, SmileCare's supplemental plan
combined with Delta Dental's primary plan certainly competes in the market for
full coverage.  n135 Importantly, determining the characteristics of the
relevant product market, including [*201]  the issue of competition between
parties, requires a factual inquiry, thus making summary dismissal
inappropriate.  n136

   2. SmileCare's Claims Asserted More than a "Bare Bones Statement"

   a. SmileCare Asserted a Valid Claim for Monopolization

 In order to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, SmileCare
must allege more than a "bare bones statement" of injury under the antitrust
laws, and the factual context of the claim must be plausible.  n137 Although the
court failed to discern a legitimate claim for monopolization on the basis of
the complaint, a closer look at SmileCare's allegations reveals a different
picture. An objective review demonstrates that SmileCare alleged each of the
elements necessary to establish a claim for monopolization under the Sherman Act
with adequate sufficiency.  n138

    SmileCare met the first element of a claim for monopolization, possession of
monopoly power in the relevant market. For purposes of the motion to dismiss,
Delta Dental conceded that it possessed market power in the relevant geographic
and product markets.  n139 SmileCare established the second element of a claim,
willful acquisition or maintenance of market power, by demonstrating not only
the unreasonableness of Delta Dental's policy but also by asserting that the
policy would ultimately eliminate all supplemental insurance plans from the
market and create a virtual monopoly for Delta Dental's full coverage option.
n140 Delta Dental's prohibition against supple-  [*202]  mental insurance is
unreasonable in light of the determination by the California Department of
Corporations that SmileCare's plan is actuarially sound  n141 and the California
Attorney General's acceptance of the practice of waiving dental copayment fees.
n142 As SmileCare alleged in its complaint, elimination of supplemental
insurance plans from the dental insurance market negatively affects consumer
choice.  n143

    In reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, such profound
adverse effects in a market illustrate predatory and anticompetitive behavior.
n144 Moreover, despite the court's rationale that the policy is both
economically and legally valid,  n145 such a prohibition is virtually unheard of
in other sectors of the health care industry.  n146

    With regard to the final element of a monopolization claim, Delta Dental's
policy is undoubtedly injurious to SmileCare because of the effect the
prohibition has on SmileCare's primary line of business. The policy prevents
SmileCare from selling its product to a substantial proportion of the dental
insurance market in California.  n147 Consumers also suffer as a result of the
Delta Dental policy in that those who wish to obtain total [*203]  coverage
without purchasing the more expensive full coverage option are forbidden from
purchasing SmileCare's "Coverage Plus" product or any other supplemental
insurance product.  n148

   b. SmileCare Also Alleged Attempted Monopolization with Enough Sufficiency

 To establish a claim for attempted monopolization, a plaintiff must allege
specific intent to destroy competition and a dangerous probability of success.
n149 The pleadings in the SmileCare case satisfy these elements.

    Delta Dental's policy goes beyond a mere intention to exclude competition
and expand its own business for full-coverage dental insurance. If Delta Dental
wanted to maintain its market share for full coverage customers, it could have
lowered its prices to be more competitive with the supplemental insurance plan
when combined with its own partial coverage option. Instead of lowering prices,
however, Delta Dental chose to cut out its competitor altogether.  n150

    Attempting to acquire market power is not, in and of itself, illegal under
the antitrust laws.  n151 An intention to prevail over competitors using
improper or unfair means is, however, prohibited under the Sherman Act, and this
element can be estab-  [*204]  lished through direct or indirect evidence.  n152
Whether or not SmileCare would have been able to produce this evidence is
unclear. By allowing the complaint to be dismissed at an early stage in the
litigation, the SmileCare court precluded discovery in this action. What is
clear, however, is that Delta Dental had the capacity to eliminate competition
in the market for full coverage based on its predominate market share.  n153
This fact was also germane to establishing the "dangerous probability" element
of an attempted monopolization claim, which requires an inquiry into relevant
product and geographic markets and an analysis of a defendant's economic power
in that market.  n154

   c. SmileCare's Claim for Group Boycott Should Have Survived a Motion to
Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim

 Applying the standard of review under Rule 12(b)(6),  n155 SmileCare's claims
asserting a "group boycott" also should have survived dismissal. Although the
court declined to consider SmileCare's group boycott claim on the grounds that
Delta Dental was not engaged in a conspiracy,  n156 given the established ties
between Delta Dental and dentists,  n157 an argument could be made that a
conspiracy did, in fact, exist. By reason of the traditionally close
relationship shared between the plan and the dental profession, dentists might
willingly accept and abide by contract terms imposed by Delta Dental.  n158

    A counter-argument could be made, however, that dentists are not necessarily
unified in their approach to payment and insurance issues. For example, the
dental profession is currently engaged in an earnest debate over the ethics of
waiving patient copayments.  n159 Nevertheless, even if individual den-  [*205]
tists opposed Delta Dental's policy regarding supplemental insurance payments,
the state dental association might have agreed to accept and uphold the
provision. Since a conspiracy is not implausible under these circumstances,
SmileCare's claim should have survived a motion to dismiss in order to give the
plaintiff a chance to engage in discovery.

    Even if the SmileCare court was reluctant to declare Delta Dental's policy
invalid per se,  n160 it should have applied a "rule of reason" approach.  n161
This approach would have required the court to consider the market or markets
involved and whether the acts or practices unreasonably affect competition.
n162 Again, consideration of the dental insurance market, the unreasonableness
of Delta Dental's policy, and its adverse effects on competition should have
been more fully explored in discovery. Since the factual context of SmileCare's
claim is credible, summary dismissal was inappropriate.  n163

   C. Given the Procedural Posture of the SmileCare Case, the Court Should not
have Considered Delta Dental's Business Justification

 The SmileCare court focused on the legitimacy of Delta Dental's prohibition
against supplemental insurance payments.  n164 It then used this reasoning to
bolster Delta Dental's defense of a valid business justification to SmileCare's
antitrust allegations and ultimately to dismiss the claims.  n165 The business
justification offered by Delta Dental was that the actuarial basis of its
insurance plan requires patients to pay for cost-sharing amounts out of their
own pockets in order to avoid the "moral hazard" associated with insurance.
[*206]

    As the dissent aptly pointed out, however, to consider this defense, the
court must first decide whether the conduct is anticompetitive.  n166 Here, the
SmileCare court accepted the truth of Delta Dental's asserted defense while
rejecting the truth of the asserted claims.  n167 The court did not adequately
explain why it accepted the business justification as a "foregone conclusion."
Whether a defendant asserts a valid business justification requires an extensive
factual inquiry, thereby precluding summary dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  n168

    Despite enthusiastic support by the court, Delta Dental's business
justification is suspect. Consider, for example, results from empirical studies
demonstrating that the price elasticity of demand for dental care is extremely
low.  n169 That the elasticity of demand is low suggests that patients will not,
in fact, seek unnecessary or inordinate amounts of dental care simply because
the services are covered by dental insurance.  n170 This empirical evidence
directly counters the court's finding that the Delta Dental policy is
economically valid because it moderates the effect of the moral hazard of
insurance by sensitizing patients to the cost of care.  n171 More importantly,
given the procedural posture of the SmileCare case, the question of whether or
not a moral hazard is present and operational in the dental insurance industry
should have been viewed as a question of fact, thereby precluding dismissal of
SmileCare's claim.  n172 Indeed, the court should have allowed SmileCare to
present factual empirical evidence that supported its position.  [*207]


   CONCLUSION

 The decision by the court in SmileCare Dental Group v. Delta Dental Plan of
California is unique in that it involves an antitrust complaint in the
supplemental dental insurance market. The case is also noteworthy because the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit took the unexpected and
controversial step of affirming the lower court's dismissal of SmileCare's
antitrust complaint for failure to state a claim, despite ample evidence that
Delta Dental's policy of prohibiting its providers from accepting supplemental
insurance payments had potentially severe and adverse implications for
consumers, providers, and supplemental insurance plans.

    SmileCare's antitrust claims should have survived dismissal because the
plaintiff alleged predatory conduct with enough sufficiency according to the
generally accepted standard of review in antitrust cases. For reasons related to
public health, the case should have been allowed to proceed. Cost sharing for
dental services can represent a substantial barrier to access to care for
patients with limited financial means, and supplemental dental insurance can
bridge that gap in coverage.

    Rather than a "signpost for the future" in antitrust enforcement, SmileCare
represents an aberration that should not be repeated. Future courts should apply
the current standard of review to antitrust complaints and resist the temptation
to grant unwarranted deference to health care defendants.

expenditures experienced no net growth between 1978 and 1989 based on a number
of possible factors, including a reduction in dental disease due to increased
exposure to fluoridation, substitution of refined sugar by artificial
sweeteners, and improved oral health habits).

Dentistry, Summer 1995, at 131, 131 (noting that over 100 million people in the
U.S., approximately 40.5% of the total population aged two years and older,
carry some form of private dental insurance); Diana Reese, Smile Insurance: Who

but that only 40% of companies overall offer such insurance).




n17.  See Anderson, supra note 14, at 41. For example, 70% of those with dental
insurance will visit their dentist at least once a year, compared to 50% of
those without insurance. See id.; see also Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Services, pub. no. 93-1511, Vital and
Health Statistics - Dental Services and Oral Health: United States, 1989, at 9

people with dental insurance had an average of 2.8 dental visits per person per
year compared to 1.7 visits for those without dental insurance); H. Barry
Waldman, Dental Insurance Coverage and the Use of Dental Services by Children,
J. Dentistry for Children, Mar.-Apr. 1989 at 125, 127 (reporting that children
with private dental insurance were more likely to have had a dental visit in the
past year than children without insurance).




n18.  See Anderson, supra note 14, at 41.




n19.  Economists use the term "moral hazard" to explain why individuals with
insurance consume more services than they would if they paid the cost of those
services out-of-pocket. See Philip Jacobs, The Economics of Health and Medical
Care 107-08 (3d ed. 1991). Insurers commonly use copayments and deductibles to
reduce the moral-hazard effect. See M. Susan Ridgely & Howard H. Goldman,
Putting the "Failure" of National Health Care Reform in Perspective: Mental
Health Benefits and the "Benefit" of Incrementalism, 40 St. Louis U. L.J. 407,
416 n.39 (1996). Importantly, the moral-hazard phenomenon occurs more frequently
when the absolute value of the elasticity of demand exceeds one. See Jacobs,
supra at 108.




n20.  Economists employ the concept of "price elasticity of demand" to measure
consumer response in quantity demanded to a change in price. See Jacobs, supra
note 19, at 77-78. An elasticity measure with an absolute value of less than 1.0
is relatively inelastic, or unresponsive to changes in price. Thus, when the
elasticity of demand is less than 1.0, a decrease in price would lead to a
decrease in total expenditures, because the relative increase in the quantity
purchased would not outweigh the price decrease. See id. Conversely, when the
elasticity measure exceeds 1.0 demand responsiveness is elastic, and a decrease
or increase in price would lead to a corresponding increase or decrease in total
expenditures because the change in consumer demand would outweigh the change in
price. See id. at 79.To illustrate this concept, consider the price of basic
goods like bread and milk, presumably goods with inelastic prices. Out of
necessity, all people requiring these foods will probably pay whatever price is
charged. Few will refuse to buy the products because of price. If the prices
falls, total expenditures will also fall because people pay less for the goods
and the lower price will lure few new consumers into the market to increase the
quantity demanded. Conversely, the demand for most luxury goods is relatively
price elastic. If, for example, the price of airline tickets dropped, more
people will take advantage of the opportunity to purchase the fares cheaply and
total expenditures will rise. As the price increases, however, fewer people will
buy fewer tickets and total expenditures will drop.




n21.  See, e.g., Douglas Conrad et al., Dental Care Demand: Insurance Effects
and Plan Design, 22 Health Services Res. 341, 356 (1987) (reporting that the
price elasticity of demand for dental care among an insured adult population is
relatively low, falling between 0.01 to 0.266); A.G. Holtmann & E. Odgers Olsen,
Jr., The Demand for Dental Care: A Study of Consumption and Household
Production, 11 J. Hum. Resources 546, 559 (1976) (confirming that elasticities
with respect to price and waiting time for dental care were small).

Prices, 23 Soc. Sci. Med. 1131, 1137 (1986) (reporting that while dental
insurance reduces patients' sensitivity to price for dental care, coinsurance
rates have a minimal effect on the average annual payments for most dental
services).




n23.  See id.




n24.  See id. (reporting that variation in coinsurance rates has a minimal
effect on utilization, especially for services other than oral exams and
prophylaxes, and that other non-price factors may have an equal or greater
effect on demand for services). Even for prophylactic treatments, a 100%
reduction in coinsurance rates increases the cost of such care by only eight
cents. See id. at 1135.

the provider, rather than the patient, determines the demand for care).

n28.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 782 (noting that the cost of Delta Dental's full
coverage option is substantially higher than the cost of its primary plans that
include copayments).




n29.  Delta Dental Plans Association is a national organization that operates
nonprofit dental service plan corporations in virtually every state. See Gary M.
Smith, Comment, Provider Control of Health Insurers: Are Doctors Still Calling
the Shots? 34 St. Louis U. L.J. 1079, 1080 n.10 (1990). The Association
traditionally enjoys close ties to the dental profession. See Delta Dental Plans
Association: Delta Dental Plans Special Relationship with the Profession, 87 J.
Am. Dental Ass'n 1102, 1102 (1973) ("The awareness of the special relationship
existing between the [dental] profession and its own sponsored and endorsed
Delta Plans has been manifested in many ways ....") (emphasis added). In fact,
the American Dental Association played a key role in providing financial support
to Delta Dental in its early days by purchasing stock in the plans' national
underwriting company. See id. Similarly, Delta Dental provides support for the
dental profession. See id. ("The Delta Dental Plans system has...done an
extraordinary job of projecting the influence and the viewpoint of the [dental]
profession ....").Hoffman v. Delta Dental Plan of Minnesota, 517 F. Supp. 564,
570 (D. Minn. 1981), explored the mutually beneficial relationship between Delta
Dental Plans and state dental associations. In Hoffman, which involved a "group
boycott" antitrust action against the dental service plan corporation, the court
observed that the state dental association created and controlled Delta Dental
by dominating its board of directors. See id. at 571. This intimate relationship
was sufficient to establish a conspiracy between Delta Dental and the Minnesota
Dental Association. See id.




n30.  Section 1-K of the American Dental Association (ADA) Principles of Ethics
and Code of Professional Conduct states in part: "A dentist who accepts a third
party payment under a copayment plan as payment in full, without disclosing to
the third party payer that the patient's payment portion will not be
collected,... is engaged in overbilling." See Gary T. Chiodo & Susan W. Tolle,
Dental Care Financing, Gen. Dentistry, Sept.-Oct. 1993, at 368, 368 (alterations
in original); see also Huntley Paton, Dentists Love to Hate Former Banker Olson,
S.F. Bus. Times, May 25, 1987, at 14 (reporting that the California Dental
Association and Delta Dental Plan have implemented policies to deny membership
to dentists who waive patient costs). According to Delta Dental, waiving
copayments and accepting the insurance reimbursement as payment in full
increases the moral hazard by further insulating patients from out-of-pocket
costs. See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1038.




n31.  In 1991, at least 15 states prohibited dentists from waiving patient
copayments without disclosure to the insurance carrier or other third-party
payer. See Brenda Harrison & Joseph Nicosia, Waiving Copayment: A Look at State
Laws, 122 J. Am. Dental Ass'n 95, 95 (1991). Some states, such as Illinois and
Massachusetts, regard waiver of copayments as "irregularities" in billing. See
id. Other states, such as Texas, regard the practice of waiving copayments as
"unprofessional and dishonorable conduct" for a dentist. See Mark J. Hanna,
Waiver of Co-payments or Deductibles...Is It Legal?, Tex. Dental J., Oct. 1994,
at 49, 49. Apparently, organized dentistry and dental insurers spearhead the
opposition to waiver of copayments. See Chiodo & Tolle, supra note 1, at
116.Most states do not prohibit this practice, however. The Attorney General of
California, for example, issued an opinion on this matter: "Where a dental
insurance plan provides that the insurance company will pay a fixed percentage
of a dentist's "usual fee,' a dentist who claims a "usual fee' that does not
account for the fact that he has waived a patient's copayment does not violate
California laws against misrepresentation and fraud." Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
1680 (West 1996) (citations omitted). But see Reynolds v. California Dental
Services, 200 Cal. App. 3d 590, 602 (Cal. App. 1988) (ruling that the nonwaiver
of copayment provision under CDS, a specialized health care service plan, did
not constitute an agreement to fix prices).




n32.  See Chiodo & Tolle, supra note 30, at 368-371 (presenting a discussion
regarding waiver of copayments). Some believe that states should allow dentists
to waive copayments under certain circumstances but not for the purpose of
"undercutting" other dentists practicing in the same market. See id. at 370.
Others contend that the ADA should reevaluate its position on waiver of
copayments and allow providers to use their own professional judgment regarding
such waivers. See id. at 371; see also Chiodo & Tolle, supra note 1, at 114-16
(discussing access to health and dental care in light of the utilitarian
principle of distributive justice and advocating greater discretion in the
dental profession to allow providers to waive copayments).

Applicants, 4 Health Care Pol'y Rep. (BNA) 37 (Sept. 16, 1996).




n35.  The number of people in the United States who have some form of private
dental insurance is estimated to be only 100 million. See Friedman et al., supra
note 16, at 131. On the other hand, approximately 29 million Americans lack
adequate health insurance, resulting in "the risk of [exposure to] large
out-of-pocket expenditures for an unusually expensive, catastrophic illness."
Pamela Farley Short, New Estimates of the Underinsured Younger than 65 Years,
274 J. Am. Med. Ass'n 1302, 1305 (1995).




n36.  See Chiodo & Tolle, supra note 30, at 370 (bemoaning the fact that
physicians have the option of "checking a box on the office visit form marked
"bill insurance only'" to treat a poor working patient with a strep throat,
whereas a dentist cannot exercise similar professional judgment and waive the
patient's fee for a toothache).Several reasons have been offered to explain why
waiver of copayment is accepted by medical but not dental insurers. For example,
the ADA House of Delegates recently adopted a policy resolution that most dental
care represents "discretionary" services. See id. Undoubtedly, patients with a
dental-health problem serious enough to warrant a hospital stay might disagree
with this assessment.

Cheating?, 322 New England J. Med. 1599, 1599 (1990).




n38.  15 U.S.C. 1 (1994). Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts,
combinations, and conspiracies that unreasonably restrain trade. Specifically,
section 1 provides: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several
States...is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any
contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be
illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony." Id.Section 2 of the Sherman Act
provides: "Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or
combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of
the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall
be deemed guilty of a felony." 15 U.S.C. 2 (1994).




n39.  15 U.S.C. 14 (1994). Section 3 of the Clayton Act, which encompasses
standards similar to section 1 of the Sherman Act, prohibits exclusive dealing
arrangements and tying arrangements that may substantially lessen competition or
tend to create a monopoly. See id. Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits
mergers and acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition or tend to
create a monopoly. See 15 U.S.C. 18 (1994).




n40.  15 U.S.C. 13 (1994). The Robinson-Patman Act, which amended section 2 of
the Clayton Act, deals with price discrimination in the sale of goods or
commodities. See id.




n41.  15 U.S.C. 45 (1994). Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA)
prohibits unfair methods of competition in commerce. See id. While the Clayton
Act permits private damage suits by individuals who were injured as a result of
antitrust activities, private parties are not permitted to bring suit under the
FTCA. See James H. Sneed & David Marx, Antitrust: Challenge of the Health Care
Field 6 (1990). In addition to these federal laws, most states also have
antitrust laws that correspond to the federal statutes. See id. at 7 (describing
state antitrust laws as "little" Sherman, Clayton, and FTCA provisions and
noting that while most state laws parallel the federal statutes, some state laws
may incorporate different substantive standards).




n42.  See Celler-Kefauver Amendments of section 7 of the Clayton Act, ch. 1184,

HMOs, 7 Health Affairs 197 (1988) (documenting recent changes in the health care
industry vis-a-vis the growth of HMOs and managed care generally).




n44.  Three landmark cases set the stage for increased antitrust activity in the
health care industry. The first case, decided by the Supreme Court in 1975,
repudiated the traditional argument that "learned professions" (i.e.,
physicians, lawyers, and other prestigious, self-regulated professions) did not
fall within the definition of "trade or commerce" and hence were exempt from
antitrust liability under the Sherman Act. See Goldfarb v. Virginia St. Bar, 421
U.S. 773, 781-92 (1975) (invalidating an attorney fee schedule set by the state
bar).The second noteworthy case, Hospital Building Co. v. Trustees of Rex
Hospital, 425 U.S. 738 (1976), entailed a claim by a newly built hospital
against several hospitals in the same market and the local Blue Cross plan. The
new hospital alleged a refusal to deal and market allocation in violation of
sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The defendants claimed that their practices
involved only local activity and did not involve "any part of the trade or
commerce among the several States" as the Sherman Act requires. Id. at 743. In
rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court construed "interstate commerce"
broadly and implied that the federal antitrust laws would apply to institutional
providers and professional associations, as well as individual providers. See
id. See generally Kenneth R. Wing, The Law and the Public's Health 214-15 (4th
ed. 1994) (discussing the Supreme Court decision in Rex Hospital and its
implications for antitrust enforcement in the health industry).The third
important decision from this era involved the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which
provides an exemption from antitrust laws for the "business of insurance," but
only to the extent that the state regulates such business and the claim does not
involve a boycott, coercion, or intimidation. 15 U.S.C. 1012(b), 1013(b) (1994).
The Supreme Court, in Group Life & Health Insurance Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440
U.S. 205 (1979), took a narrow view of the McCarran-Ferguson exception,
specifying that the Act is limited to activities involving the spreading or
underwriting of risks, and involving agreements between the insurer and the
policy holder. See id. at 217-24.In Royal Drug, plaintiffs challenged an
arrangement between an insurer and selected pharmacies to fix the retail prices
of drugs and pharmaceuticals sold to policyholders. See id. at 207. In
responding to the plaintiff's claim that the practice amounted to a group
boycott against nonparticipating pharmacies, the Court noted that the
McCarran-Ferguson Act exempted only the "business of insurance" from antitrust
laws and not the "business of insurers." Id. at 211 (emphasis added).
"Arrangements for the purchase of goods and services" do not involve any
underwriting or spreading of risk, the Court emphasized. Id. at 214. Moreover,
Congress intended the McCarran-Ferguson antitrust exemption to involve "the
relationship between insurer and insured, the type of policy which could be
issued, its reliability, interpretation, and enforcement." Id. at 215-16. From
this language, the Court stated that the clear focus of the law "was on the
relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder." Id. at 216.

n50.  See id. at 587. In Matsushita, American television manufacturers alleged
that Japanese manufacturers engaged in a predatory pricing scheme. The Court
rejected plaintiff's claims, stating that "if the factual context renders
respondent's claim implausible - if the claim is one that simply makes no
economic sense - respondents must come forward with more persuasive evidence to
support their claim than would otherwise be necessary." Id.; see also Crown Drug
Co., Inc. v. Revlon, Inc., 703 F.2d 240, 245-46 (7th Cir. 1983) (holding that
summary resolution of antitrust claims is "especially welcome where...the key

Kodak Co. v. Image Technology Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451 (1992), where the
Supreme Court stated that Matsushita "did not introduce a special burden on
plaintiffs facing summary judgment in antitrust cases" but rather "demands only
that the nonmoving party's inferences be reasonable in order to reach the jury,
a requirement that was not invented, but merely articulated, in that decision."
Id. at 468 (internal quotation omitted); see also Stephen Calkins, Summary
Judgment, Motions to Dismiss, and Other Examples of Equilibrating Tendencies in
the Antitrust System, 74 Geo. L.J. 1065, 1123 (1986) (opining that Matsushita
was "the quintessential overblown antitrust case" and that the unique and
bizarre facts of Matsushita almost always made the case distinguishable).




n52.  See, e.g., American Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 92 F.3d 781, 788 (9th
Cir. 1996) (stating that "because antitrust cases consist of primarily factual
issues, summary judgment should be used "sparingly'").




n53.  Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15 (1994), provides for treble
damages and attorney fees for private plaintiffs who suffer actual injury as a
result of conduct by a defendant that violates federal antitrust laws.




n54.  The private treble-damages provision presumably fosters four goals: (1)
deterrence of violators; (2) compensation of victims; (3) forfeiture of
ill-gotten gains; and (4) punishment for wrongdoing. See Edward D. Cavanagh,
Detrebling Antitrust Damages: An Idea Whose Time Has Come?, 61 Tul. L. Rev. 777,
783 (1987).




n55.  See id. at 791 (discussing grounds for criticism of the treble-damages
provision, including: inefficiency, unfairness, overdeterrence, encouragement of
baseless suits, and impairment of ability of American traders effectively to
compete with foreign rivals).

n58.  Daniel M. Wall, Monopolization Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, in 37th
Annual Antitrust Law Institute 385, 387-88 (1996). In determining the relevant
product market, a plaintiff must identify demand substitutes, defined as
products that consumers would substitute if the defendant substantially raised
the price of the product, and supply substitutes, which relate to barrier to
entry. See id. On the other hand, defining the relevant geographic market
requires an evaluation of historic patterns of distribution, determinations of
the size of the market area, and an analysis of transportation costs. See id. at
388-89.

   As a question of fact, courts generally reserve for a jury the right to
define the relevant market. See American Ad Mgmt. v. GTE Corp., 92 F.3d 781, 790
(9th Cir. 1996). Further, in applying Rule 12(b)(6) to an antitrust claim,
courts should be very "circumspect" in applying substantive legal rules to
market conditions. See Storer Cable Comm., Inc. v. Montgomery, 826 F. Supp.
1338, 1348 (N.D. Ala. 1993). As the Supreme Court advised in Eastman Kodak:
"Legal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctions rather than actual
market realities are generally disfavored in antitrust laws. Courts should thus
approach antitrust claims on a case-by-case basis, taking care to examine
closely the economic reality of the market at issue." 504 U.S. at 467.




n59.  See Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481 (ruling that defendent's command of
80-95% of the market with no readily available substitutes allowed plaintiff to
avoid summary judgment). Plaintiffs may employ the following steps to calculate
market share: (1) identify all firms in the relevant market, (2) choose an
output measure, and (3) calculate shares by firm. See Wall, supra note 58, at
391. In addition, the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI), which measures market
concentration, also can be used to determine market share. See id. The HHI can
be calculated by squaring the shares of market participants; values may reach
10,000, which constitutes an absolute monopoly. See id.

it is not sufficient to establish "dangerous probability of monopolization" in
an attempt case. Id. at 459.

was essential to plaintiff's viability, where defendant did not provide a
business justification for its refusal to deal, and where termination of the
agreement devastated both the plaintiff and consumers).

the approach that courts take in evaluating a claim based on unilateral refusal
to deal and outlining relevant case law).




n77.  See 15 U.S.C. 1 (1994). The basic statutory elements of a section 1
violation include: (1) a contract, combination or conspiracy among separate
entities, (2) that unreasonably restrains trade, and (3) is in or affects
interstate or foreign commerce. See Victor E. Grimm, Relationships Among
Competitors, in 26th Annual Antitrust Law Institute 117, 120 (1985).




n78.  See Horoschak, supra note 47, at 40 (discussing boycotts and threats of
boycotts as an example of an invalid horizontal restraint on trade). Generally,
in examining an alleged horizontal restraint on trade or competition, courts
will ask three questions.First, is the practice "inherently suspect" such that
it appears likely to restrict competition and reduce output? If the activity is
not inherently suspect, the court will consider the competitive effects of the
practice, including an analysis of market power. See id. at 37-38.Second, if the
activity or practice is inherently suspect, is there a plausible efficiency
justification for the practice? For example, what is the likelihood that the
practice is capable of creating or increasing competition by reducing costs? An
efficiency justification is plausible if it cannot be rejected without an
extensive factual inquiry. See id. at 38Finally, if an efficiency justification
is plausible, is it valid? A justification is generally not valid if it appears,
after further scrutiny, that the parties are really arguing that the market will
operate better with less competition, that the asserted efficiencies are
trivial, or that the restraint is not reasonably necessary to produce the stated
efficiency. See id.




n79.  See, e.g., Wilk v. American Med. Ass'n, 895 F.2d 352, 362 (7th Cir. 1990),
cert. denied, 498 U.S. 982 (1990) (holding unlawful the AMA boycott of
chiropractors under the "rule of reason"); American Med. Ass'n v. United States,
317 U.S. 519, 535-36 (1943) (upholding conviction against a medical association
for conspiracy to restrain trade by coercing members and practicing physicians
from accepting employment under a group health membership corporation that paid
providers on a risk-sharing prepayment basis).




n80.  The Supreme Court has long held that certain concerted refusals to deal or
group boycotts are so likely to restrain competition without redeeming
efficiency that they should be condemned as per se violations of the Sherman
Act. See, e.g., Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., 359 U.S. 207, 212-13
(1959) (holding as per se unlawful an agreement between an appliance retailer
and several suppliers that constituted a refusal to deal with a competing
retailer).In general, courts will apply the per se rule where a defendant acts
in an inherently unreasonable manner. See Craig D. Bachman, Per Se Offenses, in
Antitrust Health Care Enforcement and Analysis 4 (M. Elizabeth Gee ed., 1992).
Examples of antitrust activity traditionally analyzed under the per se rule
include price-fixing, concerted refusals to deal (group boycotts), division of
markets, and some tying arrangements. See id. at 8.




n81.  See, e.g., Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery and
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289-90 (1985).




n82.  The per se approach allows courts to make categorical judgments regarding
business practices that have been regarded as particularly pernicious, thereby
avoiding the significant costs associated with litigating a rule of reason
inquiry. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 343-344
(1982); see also Bachman, supra note 80, at 7 (noting that when the per se rule
applies, a court may condemn the defendant's conduct without an extensive
inquiry into the stated purpose of the activity or its actual impact on the
market).




n83.  The trend in antitrust case law has been away from the cursory analysis
applied under a per se approach and toward a rule of reason approach. See
Sullivan & Harrison, supra note 70, at 85. This is especially true if the court
presiding over the case has not had previous experience with the practice
challenged in the case at hand. See id.; see also Douglas C. Ross, Rule of
Reason Analysis: The "Quality" Defense in Health Care Cases, in Antitrust Health
Care Enforcement and Analysis 13 (M. Elizabeth Gee ed., 1992) (reporting that
the vast majority of restraints alleged to be anticompetitive are evaluated
under the "rule of reason" approach).

courts take under a "rule of reason" approach).




n85.  See F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 458-59 (1986)
(examining a practice that resembled a group boycott on the part of dentists and
their association under the rule of reason rather than applying a per se
analysis).




n86.  Id.




n87.  88 F.3d 780 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 583 (1996).




n88.  SmileCare filed suit against Delta Dental on September 8, 1993, alleging
that Delta Dental's policy prohibiting participating providers from accepting
supplemental insurance payments in lieu of patient copayments violated section 2
of the Sherman Act. See id. at 782. Specifically, SmileCare brought a claim for
monopolization, attempted monopolization, and refusal to deal. See id. at 783.
Following dismissal of these claims with leave to amend, SmileCare amended its
complaint and added a group boycott claim. See id. The lower court dismissed the
amended complaint on July 25, 1994. See id.In addition to federal claims under
the Sherman Act, SmileCare also filed supplemental claims under state law
alleging tortious interference, trade libel, breach of contract, and violations
of the California Health and Safety Code and California Business and Professions
Code. See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1037. The lower court dismissed SmileCare's
state law claims without prejudice, however, and the appellate court did not
consider those claims. See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 782 n.1.




n89.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 783. The court stated that "dismissal for
failure to state a claim is appropriate where "the complaint states no set of
facts which, if true, would constitute an antitrust offense, notwithstanding its
conclusory language regarding the elimination of competition and improper
purpose.'" Id. (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The lower court also noted
the appropriateness of a 12(b)(6) motion, given the extraordinary costs
associated with discovery in antitrust actions. SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1037.




n90.  In its concluding remarks, the SmileCare court stated that "because Delta
Dental's co-payment plan is concededly legitimate, and because SmileCare has
failed to allege that Delta Dental's enforcement of its no-waiver clause has any
anticompetitive effects, we affirm the district court [in dismissing the
complaint]." 88 F.3d. at 786.




n91.  See id.




n92.  See id. at 782.




n93.  See id. at 785. Since virtually all of California dentists contract with
Delta Dental, the state's largest dental insurer, the logical result of
providers' refusal to deal with SmileCare is the elimination of the plan from
the market. SmileCare also claimed that as a result of Delta Dental's policy,
consumers were deprived of full-coverage dental care. See id.




n94.  The SmileCare court cited two reasons for disregarding the issue of market
share or market power. First, Delta Dental conceded that it possessed market
power for dental insurance. See id. at 783 n.2. Second, the court noted that
market share does not necessarily equate to monopoly power since other factors
such as ease of entry must also be considered. See id.




n95.  While acknowledging the amount of time and effort that the parties devoted
to evaluating the market benefits of insurance copayment plans, the court
discounted the discussions and clarified that the "key issue...[was] whether
Delta Dental's refusal to recognize as contractually valid a participating
dentist's acceptance of co-payment from a supplemental insurer rather than from
the patient herself [had] any impermissible anticompetitive effects." Id. at
783-84. Moreover, the court added that potential harm to SmileCare was not
sufficient to establish an antitrust claim, since "the antitrust laws protect
competition, not competitors." Id. at 784 n.3 (citations omitted).




n96.  Although the court noted that previous court cases had addressed the
legality of copayment plans and waiver prohibition clauses and that the validity
of copayment plans was not the primary issue in this case, the SmileCare court
nevertheless revisited the lower court's discussion of "moral hazard" theory and
non-assignment clauses. SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 783.




n97.  See id at 784. Specifically, the court stated that "insurance creates a
'moral hazard' because it desensitizes patients to cost and induces them to seek
inordinate amounts of care." Id.




n98.  First Amended Complaint for Plaintiff at P 13, SmileCare Dental Group v.
Delta Dental Plan of Cal., 858 F. Supp. 1035 (C.D. Cal. 1994) (No. 93-5437 RG).




n99.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 784. The court restated the lower court's
reasoning that mandatory copayments combat the effect of the moral hazard of
insurance by "forcing patients to reflect upon the cost of services and moderate
their demands for treatment." Id. (citations omitted).




n100.  See id. at 783. The court stated that Kennedy v. Connecticut General Life
Insurance Co., 924 F.2d 698 (7th Cir. 1991), established the legality of
copayment plans by holding that insurers have a legal entitlement to create
copayment requirements. See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 783. The Ninth Circuit adopted
this holding in Davidowitz v. Delta Dental Plan of California, Inc., 946 F.2d
1476 (9th Cir. 1991).The dissent in SmileCare disagreed with the majority's use
of the holdings in Davidowitz and Kennedy because these cases based their
interpretations on ERISA rather than the Sherman Act. See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at
787 (Pregerson, J., dissenting). While the Davidowitz court faced the issue of
whether ERISA barred a non-assignment clause; the SmileCare court examined the
anitcompetitiveness of Delta Dental's conduct, which forced SmileCare and other
supplemental plans out of the dental insurance market. See id.




n101.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 784. Although SmileCare argued that
supplemental payments acted as a substitute for copayments rather than as a
waiver, the lower court asserted that this distinction was "incorrect as a
matter of law." SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1039. "So long as a patient is not
making the co-payments himself," the lower court added, "he is desensitized to
cost, even though he must pay a premium for the supplemental insurance." Id.In
dicta, the SmileCare court noted that that supplemental insurance plans were not
objectionable because they insulated patients from out-of-pocket costs but
because they paid providers directly rather than indirectly through the
patients. See id. at 784. In other words, Delta Dental would not oppose the
supplemental payments if SmileCare made them directly to the patients who, in
turn, mailed a check to their dentist. See id. Here the court made an analogy to
a patient's rich aunt or best friend who paid the copayment on behalf of the
patient. See id. If supplemental payments were made directly to the patient,
such an arrangement would be comparable to the rich aunt's payment, because
patients would be forced to "consider the pinch to their own wallets." Id.The
issue of copayments, the court stated, turned not on cost insulation, but on
contractual terms. The primary plan policy required patients to submit
copayments, and the provider contract with Delta Dental prohibited waiver of
copayments. See id. The court noted that if an insurance policy requires
copayments, then the physician must create a legal obligation for the patient to
make such payments. See id. In fact, the lower court went one step further to
say that patients enrolled in a primary plan that requires mandatory copayments
are precluded from obtaining supplemental insurance. See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp.
at 1038.The lower court ultimately concluded, and the appellate court did not
refute, that forcing providers to honor mandatory copayments is actually
pro-competitive, because it makes primary plans more feasible, thereby
increasing consumer choice, reducing insurance costs, and enabling employers to
furnish broader coverage. See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1038. According to the
lower court, the Ninth and Seventh Circuits both recognize that the enforcement
of contractual mandatory copayment provisions fosters competition by protecting
against the moral hazard of insurance. See id. The appellate court referred to
this language in its opinion. See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 784. By eliminating the
anticipated benefit of a reduced demand for services on the part of the primary
plan, the court speculated that the SmileCare supplemental plan distorted the
actuarial basis for Delta Dental's copayment plan by desensitizing patients to
the costs of care. See id. In fact, in response to increased costs caused by
patients seeking inordinate amounts of care, Delta Dental would likely raise its
prices or abandon copayment plans altogether as unprofitable, with a resulting
harm to consumers. See id. at 784 n.4. Based on this analysis, the court
determined that the Delta Dental policy was not anticompetitive.




n102.  The SmileCare court adopted the lower court's finding that "SmileCare's
supplemental insurance plan does not compete with Delta Dental's primary plan."
Id. at 785 (citing SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1039).




n103.  SmileCare argued that patients who wished to obtain 100% coverage for
dental care had two options: (1) they could purchase the more expensive Delta
Dental full coverage option, which did not include copayments, or (2) they could
purchase both a Delta Dental primary plan, which included copayments, and a
SmileCare supplemental plan. See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1039. These options
would compete with each other, according to SmileCare, thereby reducing the cost
of the full coverage option. See id. Further, SmileCare asserted that by
disallowing supplemental payments, Delta Dental "stamps out supplemental plans,"
a decidedly anticompetitive result. Id.




n104.  See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1039 (asserting that SmileCare's
allegation that Delta Dental's policy against supplemental payment allows the
insurer to insulate itself from competition is "incorrect as a matter of law,"
since, by the very definition of "competitor," Delta Dental cannot compete with
itself). Competitive discipline comes from competing primary plans rather than
supplemental plans, according to the lower court. See id.In fact, according to
the SmileCare court, SmileCare did not compete with Delta Dental, but rather, it
attempted to encroach upon Delta Dental's method of disciplining its insureds.
See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 785. Adopting the lower court's conclusion, the court
stated that rather than acting as competitors, "SmileCare has found a niche in
the coverage "gap' created by Delta Dental's co-payment plan, and now seeks to
impose on Delta Dental its own way of doing business." Id. In concluding its
argument, the court declared that SmileCare could not identify any antitrust law
which required Delta Dental to "modify a legitimate way of doing business" in
order to allow SmileCare to sell its insurance. Id.The dissent took issue with
the conclusion reached by the majority and the lower court that SmileCare and
Delta Dental are not competitors. See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 787. To reach such a
conclusion, the court must conduct a factual inquiry into the relevant market.
See id. (Pregerson, J., dissenting) (citing Thurman Industries, Inc. v. Pay "N
Pak Stores, Inc., 875 F.2d 1369, 1374 (9th Cir. 1989)). Based on the procedural
posture of the case, the dissent argued that the lower court erred by finding
that the two plans did not compete because it did not review any evidence. See
id. Likewise, according to the dissent, the SmileCare majority erred by
accepting the lower court's conclusion. See id.




n105.  See SmileCare, 858 F. Supp. at 1040.




n106.  In its complaint, SmileCare contended that Delta Dental improperly
refused to deal with the SmileCare Coverage Plus supplemental plan. See
SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 785. To support its claim under section 2 of the Sherman
Act, SmileCare cited Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S.
585, 602-05 (1985), for the proposition that a refusal to deal can constitute an
antitrust violation without a legitimate business justification. See SmileCare,
88 F.3d at 785.




n107.  SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 786. The dissent rejected the approach taken by the
majority in SmileCare. Specifically, the dissent noted that a business
justification was an affirmative defense to anticompetitive conduct. See id. at
787. Whether a valid business reason justified a monopolist's conduct was a
question of fact, as the majority stated. See id. According to the dissent, the
majority erred in deciding the question of Delta Dental's legitimate business
justification on a motion to dismiss. See id.According to the dissent, the
SmileCare court accepted Delta Dental's asserted defense as true while
repudiating SmileCare's allegations. See id. at 788. On a motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim, the court should have declined to consider the
affirmative defense and determine only whether SmileCare's well pleaded facts,
if true, could constitute an antitrust claim for which the plaintiff was
entitled to relief. See id.




n108.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 786.




n109.  See id. In Aspen Skiing Co., a case on which SmileCare relied on for its
argument that Delta Dental's policy represented a "refusal to deal," a ski
resort backed out of a longstanding ticket-sharing arrangement that it had made
with a smaller competitor. See 472 U.S. at 604-10 The Supreme Court upheld a
claim made by the smaller competitor for "refusal to deal," because the resort's
decision to discontinue the arrangement, which changed the character of the
market, was not based on efficiency or a legitimate business reason.  See id.




n110.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 786.




n111.  See id. (stating that failure to allege a conspiracy between Delta Dental
and any other party precludes SmileCare from bringing a group boycott claim).
SmileCare alleged that Delta Dental used its dominant position in the market to
coerce or induce dentists to boycott its supplemental plan. Id. at 785.




n112.  359 U.S. 207 (1959).




n113.  In Klor's, the plaintiff and the defendant were competing retail stores
for household items. See id. at 209. Klor's took steps to draw customers away
from its competitor, and Broadway-Hale responded by persuading manufacturers and
distributors not to sell to Klor's or to sell goods on unfavorable terms. See
id. at 209. The Supreme Court held that Broadway-Hale's actions violated
sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, because the alleged conspiracy with
manufacturers and wholesalers was designed to drive a competitor out of
business. See id. at 209-10.




n114.  See SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 786. Again citing the lower court's reasoning,
the SmileCare court distinguished the Klor's case because "SmileCare and Delta
Dental are not competitors." Id.; see supra note 97 (discussing the lower
court's determination that copayments actually encourage competition).




n115.  See supra note 44 and accompanying text (tracing the development of
antitrust enforcement in the health care industry from a time in which the
industry enjoyed a virtual exemption from federal antitrust laws to the present,
in which courts demonstrate a willingness to find health care defendants liable
for antitrust violations).




n116.  See supra note 43 and accompanying text (discussing recent monumental
changes in the U.S. health care system).




n117.  See supra note 45 and accompanying text (noting that the FTC and the DOJ
have vigorously enforced federal antitrust provisions in light of changes in the
health care market).




n118.  See supra note 46 (discussing recent DOJ and FTC guidelines regarding
antitrust enforcement in the health industry). Despite the court's high-handed
approach and apparent disregard for the supplemental insurance industry,
supplemental insurers need not be concerned that the holding in this case could
have broader implications for their line of business. Based on recent holdings
in other jurisdictions and the general policy statements promulgated by the FTC
and DOJ expressing an increased rather than a decreased willingness to pursue
antitrust enforcement in health care, the decision in SmileCare appears to be an
aberration rather than a trend.

Delta Dental primary plan combined with a SmileCare supplemental plan).




n136.  See supra note 58 (noting that, as a question of fact, a court ordinarily
reserves for a jury the right to define the relevant market); see also supra
note 104 (citing the dissent's assertion that the question of whether Delta
Dental and SmileCare are competitors is a question of fact).




n137.  See supra notes 50-52 and accompanying text (summarizing the standard for
summary dismissal of antitrust claims).




n138.  See supra text accompanying note 56 (outlining the elements of a claim
for monopolization). Whether or not SmileCare's claim would prevail on its
merits at trial is not at issue here. Rather, the issue is whether SmileCare's
claims are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a
claim.




n139.  SmileCare, 88 F.3d at 783. Despite this concession, the SmileCare court
declined to address the issue of market share or market power. See supra note
94.




n140.  See supra note 93 (restating SmileCare's allegation that Delta Dental's
policy effectively eliminates supplemental plans from the dental insurance
market and maintaining that this result is decidedly anticompetitive).

California Department of Corporation).




n142.  See supra note 31 (noting the position of the California Attorney
General).




n143.  See supra note 93 (stating SmileCare's allegations that consumers were
deprived of full-coverage dental care by virtue of Delta Dental's policy).




n144.  See supra note 61 and accompanying text (noting that predatory,
anticompetitive, or exclusionary conduct can establish the second element of a
monopoly claim). Delta Dental conceded, however, that it would not oppose
supplemental payments if SmileCare made them directly to patients who then
mailed the check to their dentist. See supra note 101 (noting Delta Dental's
position on supplemental insurance payments which first pass through the
insured).




n145.  See supra notes 97, 99-100 and accompanying text (discussing the court's
reasoning that mandatory copayments are economically valid in that they offset
the moral hazard of insurance and legally valid based on precedent).




n146.  See supra notes 33-37 (discussing the widespread use of supplemental
insurance plans in the medical sector)




n147.  Only 40% of the U.S. population has dental insurance. See supra text
accompanying note 16 (estimating the percent of the U.S. population with dental
insurance). Of the limited California proportion of the population with
insurance, Delta Dental controls the largest market share, and Delta Dental
contracts with nearly all of the dentists in the state. See supra text
accompanying note 92. These numbers suggest that by prohibiting supplemental
insurance payments, Delta Dental has denied SmileCare access to a substantial
proportion of its potential customer base.




n148.  See supra note 103 (addressing SmileCare's claim that patients who wished
to obtain 100% coverage for dental care could either purchase Delta Dental full
coverage or a Delta Dental primary plan combined with a SmileCare or other
supplemental plan, which is considerably cheaper). Strict enforcement of the
Delta Dental policy leaves consumers with only one choice, the more expensive
full coverage option. See supra note 101. Thus, in addition to extinguishing
SmileCare's customer base, the Delta Dental policy also adversely effects
consumer choice.




n149.  See supra text accompanying note 68 (outlining the elements necessary to
establish a claim for attempted monopolization).




n150.  See supra note 103 (quoting SmileCare's allegation that Delta Dental's
conduct is anticompetitive because it "stamps out supplemental insurance
plans"). The lower court rejected this assertion by arguing that SmileCare and
Delta Dental are not competitors. See supra Part II.A.2 (responding to
SmileCare's claim that Delta Dental's conduct is anticompetitive by stating that
the parties are not in competition with each other).

   As the dissent points out, the lower court erred in rejecting SmileCare's
allegations, since on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, facts
alleged by the nonmoving party are presumed to be true. See note 104 (discussing
the lower court's error in rejecting claims made by SmileCare despite the
procedural posture of the case).

reluctance of courts to find per se unreasonable rules adopted by professional
associations).

cases).

summary dismissal of antitrust claims). Even the majority recognizes that the
existence of a valid business reason is a question of fact. See supra text
accompanying note 104 (quoting the court's pat declaration that Delta Dental's
business defense is "a foregone conclusion requiring no further analysis").

n170.  See supra note 20.




n171.  See supra notes 19, 99.




n172.  See supra note 58. The Supreme Court has held that courts should examine
the economic realities of markets on a case-by-case basis. See Eastman Kodak Co.
v. Image Tech. Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 467 (1992). The issue of moral
hazard in the dental insurance industry certainly qualifies as a characteristic
of the relevant product market. Thus, it was inappropriate for the SmileCare
court to conclude that the moral hazard occurs in the dental insurance industry
and then to use the theory to establish Delta Dental's business justification.

Sun-News report

LAS CRUCES   Improvements to a major taxiway at Las Cruces International Airport
will soon be starting after the Las Cruces City Council awarded a $4.47 million
contract Monday to an El Paso construction company to do the work.

The seven-member council unanimously voted to approve the contract of Jordan
Construction. The contract also selected Delta Airport Consultants to provide
management services during the project, and the council's action also approved
acceptance of a $144,312 New Mexico Department of Transportation (NMDOT) grant
that will help pay for the work.

In a separate matter, the council also awarded a $440,620 contract to Woolpert
Inc. to develop an electronic airport layout plan, which city officials
anticipate will be a great aid in future planning, and potential expansion, of
the airport, on the city's West Mesa.

The council also approved changes to two planned unit developments (PUD), the
Dave Timski PUD and Good Samaritan Village II. They replace a single planned
unit development of more than 28 acres, that until Monday had been known as
Remington Estates.

The Timski PUD encompass a little more than 15 acres, and will be a mixed-use
project including limited commercial space, office and multi-family residential
units. The Good Samaritan Village II plan will be on slightly more than 13
acres, adjacent to the Timski PUD, and will include an assisted-living facility,
offering apartments, townhouses, nursing care and other related uses. A limit of
200 dwelling units would be built.

The council also approved an agreement with NMDOT that stipulates the city will
pay for electricity and maintenance costs for traffic signals and street lights
on a portion of Engler Road, between Elks Road and Del Rey Boulevard. Early next
year, NMDOT will begin work to extend Engler Road underneath Interstate 25,
between Elks and Del Rey.

Mar. 3--Paula Nichols, a second-grade teacher at Blue Ridge Elementary School,
is receiving the Golden Gift Scholarship Award from Delta Kappa Gamma. The award
will cover her attendance at a two-week leadership and management seminar in
Austin, Texas, this summer.

She was one of just 30 women selected for the all expenses-paid award. Paula
competed against women from all DKG chapters in 17 countries. The award
application process included stating her role in the Delta Kappa Gamma society,
her community involvement record and a description of how she would use her
improved leadership skills. She also needed recommendations from her principal
and the president of her previous Delta Kappa Gamma group.

"The seminar is conducted by experts in the field of leadership and management,"
Paula said in a statement. "It is a very intense two-week seminar."

She is a member of the recently formed local Walla Walla chapter, Alpha Gamma.
This chapter was organized last summer and met for the first time in October.
Currently there are 17 members in the Walla Walla chapter. Paula hopes the group
will increase to 35 members.

Alpha Gamma meets on the second Tuesday of each month for dinner at a local
restaurant. Members are from Touchet, Prescott, and Waitsburg, and they would
welcome members from Dayton and College Place.

"Each month we plan a program that is beneficial and entertaining to educators.
We want to be able to give a scholarship to a high school senior in the valley
who is interested in going into the field of education."

Established in 1929, Delta Kappa Gamma is a women's group that provides members
with valuable professional and personal growth opportunities, including
leadership development. Learn more at www.deltakappagamma.net.

Walla Walla's recent Julia Child Boeuf Bourguignon Cookoff  raised $800 for
cancer patients, according to Kathleen Obenland, director of public affairs at
Providence St. Mary Medical Center. Trevor Dorland won with his recipe. The
event honored chef Julia Child, who died in 2004.

The funds will aid cancer patients at Providence St. Mary Regional Cancer
Center.

The Feb. 5 event at Someone's in the Kitchen was sponsored by the Downtown Walla
Walla Foundation and Walla Walla Union-Bulletin.

Seventeen people entered the contest, overseen by 100-plus spectators. The
proceeds went into St. Mary's Special Needs Fund, which pays for various
expenses that medical insurances usually don't cover, such as gas for patients
to travel to treatment, lodging, food, wigs for patients who lose their hair and
items for symptom control.

A Roundup of Recent Developments in the For-Profit Higher-Education Industry.

BLOWING THE WHISTLE: For Career Education Corporation, the bad news continues.
In late May, the company revealed that it was being investigated by the civil
division of the U.S. Department of Justice as a result of a "false claims"
lawsuit that alleges that some of Career Education's colleges had made false
statements to the government, allowing them to obtain federal funds for which
they were not entitled. The company reported that the Justice Department was
seeking documents regarding information that the company gives prospective
students about job-placement rates and costs at the unnamed institutions. The
company, which said it was cooperating fully with the investigation, said it was
also asked to provide information related to compensation of admissions officers
and the use of Pell Grants at one institution. False-claims lawsuits are
initiated by whistle-blowers when they believe a party has obtained government
funds unlawfully. The government can decide to join the case or let the
whistle-blowers carry it on themselves. If the accusers prevail, they are
entitled to a share in any judgments.

News of the lawsuit came just two weeks after Career Education learned that the
U.S. Department of Education had no imminent plans to lift a June 2005
moratorium on new campuses. In a letter to the company, the department said it
was concerned by the company's "history of noncompliance" with federal laws
governing federal financial-aid funds. The department said it also "had some
concerns about misrepresentations" by company staff to prospective students at
its Brooks College.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS I: The deal that has wowed the
for-profit-higher-education industry -- the $3.4-billion purchase of publicly
traded Education Management Corporation by two private-equity groups -- became
final on June 1. The Pittsburgh-based company was acquired by Providence Equity
Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for $43 per share, after operating
for 10 years as a public company. During that period, Education Management had
itself gobbled up another higher-education company that was once publicly
traded, the Argosy Education Group. With 72 primary campus locations in 24
states and two Canadian provinces, Education Management is one of the largest
operators of for-profit colleges in the country, with institutions including
Argosy University, the Art Institutes, Brown Mackie College, and South
University, offering associate, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS II: One of the smallest of the publicly traded
higher-education companies, Concorde Career Colleges, is also slated to be taken
private. In June the company announced that it was being acquired by Liberty
Partners, a New York private-equity firm, in a deal worth $114.5-million.
Concorde operates 12 campuses in seven states offering training for jobs in
health care. Liberty Partners had established an affiliate called Liberty Higher
Education LLC, which bought York Technical Institute, of York, Pa., in May 2005.
Under the terms of the latest deal, which is slated to close in the third
quarter of this year, a new affiliate of Liberty will pay Concorde stockholders
$19.80 per share, a premium of 34 percent above its closing price on the day
before the sale was announced.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS III: The investor group that bought Delta Educational
Systems in 2001 and oversaw its expansion from five campuses to 16 has now
turned around and sold it to another investor-backed education company -- for a
healthy profit. Huron Capital Partners said it had invested about $10-million in
Delta Educational Systems and had earned back about 11.7 times that. Huron owned
a majority but not all of Delta, which means the overall sale price was greater
than $117-million. Joe Kennedy, founder of Delta, owned a minority stake.

The colleges owned by Delta, which include Creative Circus and Miller-Motte
Technical College, award two-year degrees and certificates in allied health,
business, information technology, and vocational trades and enroll about 6,500
students. The investor group that bought Delta, Gryphon Investors, of San
Francisco, had previously bid unsuccessfully to buy two other college companies,
Remington College and Vatterott College. Neither of those companies was
ultimately sold.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS IV? The company that owns the troubled Interboro
Institute, of New York City, EVCI Career Colleges Holding Inc., has announced
that it has hired an investment bank to help it identify and evaluate "strategic
financial and business alternatives." That's Wall Street speak for seeking a
buyer or a merger partner. In addition to Interboro, a college that has drawn
scrutiny and enrollment restrictions from New York State regulators who have
found fault with its aggressive growth tactics, EVCI owns Technical Career
Institutes and the Pennsylvania School of Business.

NEW NAME, SAME COLLEGE: The nursing school formerly known as Deaconess College
of Nursing, which DeVry Inc. bought in March 2005 from Tenant Health Systems,
became Chamberlain College of Nursing in July. The company changed the name
because its right to use the Deaconness name was due to expire at the end of
September. In addition to its on-campus courses at its St. Louis location and
its distance-education programs, Chamberlain seeks to expand its campus-based
programs into other markets, beginning with Ohio.

ACCREDITATION RESCUED: Six campuses owned by Corinthian Colleges Inc. that had
been at risk of losing their accreditation -- and their all-important
eligibility to participate in federal student-aid programs -- received renewals
last month from the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools. The bureau
had denied continued accreditation for the Atlanta campus of Corinthian's
Georgia Medical Institute and its two branches in Marietta and Jonesboro, Ga.
Corinthian appealed that December 2005 decision. The continued accreditation
runs though December 2007.

Separately the same accreditor granted continued accreditation to the company's
Olympia Career Training Institute, in Grand Rapids, Mich., and its branch
campuses in Kalamazoo, Mich., and Merrillville, Ind. Those campuses, which had
been under a "show cause" order, were reaccredited through December 2009. The
director of the accrediting bureau said the Georgia Medical Institute's
accreditation was for a shorter period than Olympia's because the bureau
typically grants short continuations after a college has been cited with an
adverse action. The "show cause" was a less-serious finding.

ADDING A BRAND: With its May purchase of the New England Institute of Technology
at Palm Beach, Lincoln Educational Services Corporation has added an eighth
brand to its portfolio of institutions. The company, which paid $34.5-million in
cash for the institution (and assumed its $7.2-million mortgage), has renamed it
the Lincoln College of Technology. The 1,200-student institute in Florida, which
started out in the early 1980s as a branch of the nonprofit New England
Institute of Technology -- but has not been affiliated with that Warwick, R.I.,
institution since 1984 -- offers programs up to the bachelor's-degree level in
culinary arts, automotive technology, health sciences, information technology,
cosmetology, and other fields.

* Education Management Corporation was acquired by private investors during the
second quarter of 2006, and its last day of trading on the Nasdaq Market was
June 1. Through that date, its stock performance was factored into the
calculations for The Chronicle For-Profit Higher Education Index.

Mass. firms mull cuts in health benefits

LENGTH: 1509  words


Some Massachusetts companies are considering trimming employee insurance
benefits as they prepare to implement provisions of President Obama's health
care overhaul, a move that follows announcements by several national firms that
they plan to cut coverage, according to business leaders.
In recent weeks, UPS and Delta Airlines, among others, have said they would
scale back benefits to make up for new expenses incurred under the health law.
That has prompted employers across the country, including in Massachusetts, to
study whether to cut the number of hours in a typical workweek and eliminate
coverage for spouses who can get insurance through their own employer, among
other changes.


The potential cutbacks in coverage come just months before the law requires most
Americans to obtain health insurance by Jan. 1. Some Massachusetts industry
leaders say they are worried that progress made under the state's
first-in-the-nation health reform law will stall - or that advances will be
lost.
"It only takes one or two companies like UPS to start the trend. And that makes
me nervous because in Massachusetts, there's nowhere to go but backwards," said
Kristen Lepore, vice president for government affairs at the Associated
Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest employer association. "Both
small and large employers are concerned." The uncertainty is echoed by other New
England business groups, which are watching Massachusetts companies closely as
they weigh whether to drop health insurance coverage and move workers into
government-run marketplaces where many will qualify for federal subsidies to buy
private insurance. Companies in New England that are known to be considering
coverage cutbacks refused to speak on the record because they do not want to
incite employee backlash before a decision has been made and risk losing workers
to competitors, say trade group representatives.
"They're still trying to figure this out, and they don't want to tip their
hand," said Don Nokes, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health.
Similar concerns were raised in 2006, when Massachusetts passed its health
reform law on which the federal legislation was modeled.
At the time, businesses worried that costs would skyrocket and eat into their
bottom lines. Consumer advocates worried employers would drop coverage.
The fears proved unfounded. The number of employers offering health insurance
grew from 70 percent in 2005 to 76 percent in 2011 - compared to a stagnant 60
percent nationally, according to a report by the Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts Foundation.

Now Massachusetts employers are increasingly worried about the ramifications of
the federal law, which, in some instances, imposes more stringent - and more
expensive - requirements than the state law.
The federal law requires companies with 50 or more employees to offer insurance
to full-time workers - those working 30 or more hours a week. The state law, on
the other hand, defines full-time as over 35 hours a week.
As a result, Lepore and others said, many companies that employ low-wage,
seasonal, or part-time workers - including retail and fast-food businesses, and
even colleges and universities - are contemplating reducing employees' schedules
to under 30 hours a week so they do not have to bear the cost of providing
health insurance.
To mitigate employer concerns and give businesses across the country time to
adjust, the Obama administration announced this summer that it would delay the
employer mandate to offer health insurance by one year, to 2015.
After 2015, large companies that do not offer their full-time employees
insurance will be fined $2,000 per employee. In comparison, the fine for not
covering employees in Massachusetts was $295, but that has now been abolished to
make way for the federal penalty.
Notwithstanding the Obama administration's decision to put off the employer
mandate for a year, some companies have already decided to cut employee hours,
which would enable them to provide coverage to fewer workers when the law does
go into full effect.
Forever 21, a national teen clothing chain, said in August that it will cut the
hours for full-time nonmanagement staff to 29.5 hours a week. The company denied
the change was made in response to the federal law, known as the Affordable Care
Act, or, colloquially, as "Obamacare."
Some advocates for expanding health care have said companies are using the law
as a scapegoat in explaining coverage cutbacks.
UPS, the shipping company, recently said it will not cover spouses of employees
if the spouses have jobs that provide health coverage. The company said that the
decision, which will affect 15,000 spouses, was made in part because of higher
costs associated with the Affordable Care Act.
"This change is consistent with the way many large employers are responding to
the costs associated with the health care reform legislation," said the company
in a memo to employees. Before reaching its decision, UPS said it studied other
companies' health benefits and determined that 35 percent plan to exclude
working spouses in 2014.

Delta Airlines has reduced the generous health benefits offered to its pilots in
order to avoid a new federal tax on costly health plans, known as the "Cadillac
tax." Starting in 2018, most employers must pay a 40 percent excise tax on the
amount that premiums for a health plan exceed $10,200 for an individual and
$27,500 for a family.
"Given enough years, all plans will eventually risk being subject to the
Cadillac tax and as they do, the natural reaction will be to continually reduce
benefits provided," wrote a Delta executive in a memo.
The myriad new taxes imposed under the federal law make Massachusetts companies
nervous, Lepore said. Many are awaiting insurance rates for Jan. 1 to be
announced before making a decision on benefits.
"If prices keep going up, they may entertain a plan with less coverage," said
Ryan Kearney, general counsel of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts,
which represents smaller businesses. "For some businesses, depending on how
their numbers work out, it may be more optimal for them to drop coverage and
just pay the fine."
Among the primary concerns for companies with fewer than 50 employees is that
the federal law requires Massachusetts to dismantle its own insurance rating
system that allowed insurers to consider about 10 factors in setting the rates
for small businesses.
The federal law mandates that insurers use only four rating factors - age,
number of family members, geographic area, and tobacco use - and does not take
into account the size of the company, a change that small businesses fear will
drive costs up by more than 50 percent.
The federal government has agreed to allow Massachusetts to phase in the change
over three years, but the Bay State business community, as well as the
Legislature, will continue seeking a federal waiver.
"If we don't get the waiver and some employers see those big rate increases, we
might see some employers dropping coverage," said Richard Lord, president and
CEO of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts.
In Warwick, R.I., a manufacturing company employing about 100 workers has
eliminated health coverage for employees' spouses, going as far as calling the
spouses' employers to check whether they offer health insurance, said Amy
Gallagher, vice president of major accounts at the Cornerstone Group, a benefits
advisory firm based in Rhode Island.
The company expects the move to save 15 to 20 percent in health benefit costs,
Gallagher said. Gallagher said the company's owner did not want the business to
be named.

While national business groups have been hostile to some elements of the federal
law, Massachusetts companies for the most part bought into the state's reform
efforts in 2006, a key reason why the state law has been so successful,
advocates and business leaders say.
"It's critically important to maintain the underpinnings of what made health
reform successful in Massachusetts, which includes employer responsibility,"
said Amy Whitcomb Slemmer, executive director of the Boston-based Health Care
For All.
Indeed, the Obama law has spurred at least one Massachusetts company to expand
employee access to health coverage beyond federal requirements.
Framingham-based Cumberland Gulf Group, which owns the Cumberland Farms
convenience stores and Gulf Oil gas stations, is reclassifying more than 1,200
part-time workers to full time to make them eligible for health insurance
beginning Oct 1. The company said the move will cost the company several million
dollars but will help it retain valued workers, which it said would please
customers and pay off in the long run.
"Some companies are taking full-time people and converting them to part time.
We're taking the opposite approach," said John McMahon, Cumberland Gulf Group's
senior vice president and chief human resources officer. "It's not just the
right thing to do, but it's also a good business decision."

NeighborWorks program wins national award

ROCKINGHAM -- NeighborWorks HomeOwnership Center of Southeastern Vermont, a
program of Rockingham Area Community Land Trust and USDA Rural Development, was
honored last week during the national NeighborWorks Rural Initiative members
conference in Abingdon, Va. This is the first-ever RD Partnership Award
presented by NeighborWorks America.

The award, one of seven received by participating national organizations, is for
successful partnerships between NeighborWorks network organizations and Rural
Development to promote rural homeownership. In addition to framed award
certificates, each NeighborWorks "awardee" received a $5,000 grant in support of
partnership activities.

Bruce Whitney, HomeOwnership Center director, nominated Deborah Boyd, USDA Rural
Development Specialist, for her consistent collaboration with RACLT's
HomeOwnership Center over the last 10 years to assist families to purchase homes
in rural Vermont.

USDA Rural Development with Boyd's leadership partners with RACLT in many ways.
RACLT serves northern Windham County and southern Windsor County. Both are rural
counties with all towns eligible for the Rural Development's many programs.
Together, Rural Development and RACLT assist families who would not otherwise be
able to enter the homeownership market.

Boyd provided leadership in the successful completion of RACLT's two Rural
Development Self-Help projects in Bellows Falls and Springfield. Boyd has
consistently participated in RACLT's Homebuyer Education program and our
outreach events including homebuyer's celebrations and orientations.

"The award is for the partnership's success in promoting rural homeownership,
but the judges were also pleased to see how RACLT called out Deb Boyd from the
local RD office as a key individual who has consistently gone the extra mile on
behalf of potential homebuyers," stated Dave Dangler, NeighborWorks Rural
Initiative Director.

Boyd began her employment with the Farmers Home Administration in June 1978 as a
summer aid. Over her 29-plus years career she has held several housing positions
in the Brattleboro RD office. Boyd volunteers at her local food pantry,
agricultural fair, and is an advisor to the family selection committee for West
River Habitat for Humanity. She has two grown children, two dachshunds and
enjoys riding motorcycles with her husband.

"My experience with the Homeownership Center staff has been incredible. They are
there whenever I have an applicant in need of counseling or helping a buyer
through the home purchase process. I know they are only a phone call or an
e-mail away. Their partnership and assistance are greatly appreciated," said
Boyd.

Rural Development and RACLT will continue to work closely together to provide
customers, especially first time buyers, with the personal attention and
guidance needed to experience the "American Dream" of becoming homeowners."I
tell our mutual customers that NeighborWorks HomeOwnership Center of
Southeastern Vermont is their best support system throughout the home buying
process and we are in almost daily contact with one another. Their assistance
makes my job easier," said Boyd.

OSU-OKC Allied Health building features high-tech training, community clinic

BYLINE: By K.S. McNutt Staff Writer kmcnutt@oklahoman.com

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 607 words


Health care professionals of tomorrow and today are engaged in training and
patient care under one roof on the campus of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma
City.A new Allied Health Building at 440 N Portland Ave. features high-tech labs
for students and a working community health clinic for the public.Construction
of the 45,000-square-foot building began in May 2015 and was completed in time
for classes to begin this week. The Variety Care clinic opened one week
earlier.Officials came together Friday to dedicate the $13 million
building.OSU-OKC President Natalie Shirley said nursing students and faculty
began talking to her about the need for a new building from her first day on the
job five years ago."Because of the reputation of our health sciences programs,
we have seen an increase in demand that we couldn't meet. Now we have greater
capacity to give our allied health students the foundation to be the very best
in their chosen field," Shirley said.The health sciences division comprises
nursing, diagnostic sonography, nutritional sciences,  radiological technology
and health care administration.Hands-on learning labsThe simulation center is
the heart of the building, with lifelike manikins that allow students to train
for real-life situations they will encounter in their future work, Shirley
said.The manikins are in a 10-bed lab and individual rooms where students
practice care in situations like surgery, emergency care, intensive care and
labor and delivery.

The wireless manikins are controlled by instructors outside the room to simulate
a real environment. They can do all the things real patients do, including
blink, cry, moan, breathe, lose blood pressure, vomit and die.The simulation
center also will provide training and continuing education classes for health
care workers employed at area hospitals.Room for more nursesShirley said the new
facility means OSU-OKC can enroll about 100 more nursing students each year. The
program accepts about 200 annually, but with 1,400 students in prenursing many
applicants are turned away, she said.The successful program gradates about 300
nurses annually with a pass rate on the national certification exam 10 percent
higher than the national average, she said.Anna Nguyen, head of the nursing
department, said the new facility is "adaptable, flexible and multidimensional
so we can meet today's health care needs."The simulation labs, state-of-the-art
technology and partnerships with other health care agencies provide great
educational opportunities, Nguyen said.The nursing students do clinical
rotations to learn how to take care of patients in clinics, hospitals and in
their homes."Having the clinic right under our roof is a great benefit," she
said.Benefits for allThe Variety Care clinic provides OSU-OKC students more than
the chance to interact with physicians and patients and to work as part of a
health care team.Students and their families are among those who can use the
clinic.Many OSU-OKC students and nearby residents lack access to quality health
services, Variety Care CEO Lou Carmichael said. Variety Care serves patients
with limited or no insurance.Services offered at the clinic include family and
pediatric medicine and dentistry, obstetrics, family planning, behavioral health
and optometry.Classroom and training equipment was made possible through grants
and donations from the U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development
Administration, The Hearst Foundations, Integris, Sarkeys Foundation, Cox,
Presbyterian Health Foundation and Pedigo Products. Delta Dental provided
funding for the equipment in the Variety Care dental suite.

HIGHLIGHT: This is a status report on recently passed and pending legislation
and regulations, gubernatorial nominations and appointments of interest to
lawyers.  It is compiled by the legislative department of the New Jersey State
Bar Association.  Following each bill is the number, sponsor's name, NJSBA
position, if any, bill description and status.



P. L. 2003, c. 200. This bill, designated the "Brain Injury Research Act,"
establishes an 11-member New Jersey State Commission on Brain Injury Research
in, but not of, the Department of Health and Senior Services.  The commission's
responsibility is to design and administer a grant program to fund approved
medical and scientific research projects that focus on the treatment of brain
injury, emphasizing projects that study nerve regeneration as a means to a cure
for brain injury.  The moneys for these grants would be generated by a $ 1
surcharge on all motor vehicle fines.  These moneys would be deposited in a
special non-lapsing fund, known as the "New Jersey Brain Injury Research Fund."
The bill also permits a municipal or county agency that forwards monies to the
state treasurer collected from the additional penalties assessed for the "New
Jersey Brain Injury Research Fund" to retain an amount equal to 2 percent of the
monies collected for its administrative costs associated with this process.
This is to ensure that the state does not impose an unfunded mandate on
municipalities and counties in violation of the provisions of Article VIII,
Section II, paragraph 5 of the state Constitution.  The commission is directed
to: review and authorize approved research projects, emphasizing projects that
study nerve regeneration as a means to a cure for brain injury, and may
establish an independent scientific advisory panel composed of scientists and
clinicians who are not members of the commission to review proposals submitted
to the commission and make funding recommendations to the commission; apportion
all available funds to qualifying research institutions to finance approved
research projects and necessary institutional support services; ensure that
funds so apportioned to approved research projects are not diverted to any other
use; take steps necessary to encourage the development within the state of brain
injury research projects; compile a directory of all brain injury research
projects being conducted in the state; and provide the governor and the
Legislature with a report by Jan. 30 of each year describing the status of the
commission's activities and the results of its funded research efforts.  In
addition, the commission is directed to establish and maintain, in conjunction
with the Department of Health and Senior Services, a central registry of persons
who sustain brain injuries other than through disease, whether or not the injury
results in a permanent disability, in order to provide a database that indicates
the incidence and prevalence of brain injuries and that will serve as a resource
for research, evaluation and information on brain injuries and available
services.  The bill requires that health care facilities and providers report
all cases of brain injuries, except those caused through disease, and submit
specified additional information on reported cases, to the commission.  The
commission shall, by regulation, specify the health care facilities and
providers required to make the report, information that shall be included in the
report, the method for making the report and the time period in which the report
shall be made.

The reports made to the registry are to be used only by the commission and the
Department of Health and Senior Services and such other agencies as may be
designated by the commission or the department and shall not otherwise be
divulged or made public so as to disclose the identity of any person to whom
they relate.  To ensure that the required reports are made to the commission,
the bill establishes a penalty of up to $ 100 per unreported brain injury case.
The bill also specifies that its provisions shall not preclude a qualifying
research institution or any other research facility in the state from directly
applying for or receiving funds from any public or private agency to conduct
brain injury research.  The bill was signed into law on Jan. 2, 2004. (A-1771)

The average cost of assisted living facilities in Oklahoma City is 10 percent
less than the national average while Tulsa is 11.1 percent higher than the U.S.
rate.

In the United States, the average cost is $2,159 per month, or $25,908 per year,
according to the MetLife Assisted Living Market Survey 2002. The study showed
that the highest monthly average was New York City at $3,696 per month while the
lowest was $592 per month in Jackson, Miss.

The report showed that assisted living costs in Oklahoma were $1,943 per month
in Oklahoma City and $2,398 per month in Tulsa.

However, assisted living remains far less expensive than nursing home care,
which averages $61,000 per year, according to MetLife officials.

Allstate Insurance

The Allstate Foundation has awarded a grant of $3,000 to the Contact Crisis
Helpline for its suicide prevention program. JoAnn Pace, president of Contact
Crisis Helpline, said the money would be used to help train 25 more volunteers
to take the program to another four school districts.

Council of Public Affairs

Merrill Matthews, Jr., director of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance
and columnist for Investor's Business Daily, will be the featured speaker at a
policy luncheon hosted by the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs at noon
Thursday at the Oklahoma City Marriott Hotel.

Matthews will speak on the problem of rising health care costs in Oklahoma.

The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs is a conservative think tank emphasizing
free enterprise and limited government. Call 843-9212 for reservations.

Medicaid

The rate at which Oklahoma children on Medicaid accessed health care hit an
all-time high last year, according to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority.

Officials said Oklahoma is now at a 62 percent compliance rate. The program
provides care for individuals aged 20 and younger who are Medicaid eligible.

Physician training

The Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences Center for Health
Policy Research has issued a report showing the Oklahoma Physician Manpower
Training Commission's physician assistance and placement incentive programs
positively impacts the Oklahoma economy.

The assistance program provides state money for college scholarships and loans
to encourage doctors to go into practice in underserved areas.

The report showed that on average, each family physician in rural Oklahoma will
generate an estimated 50 full-time jobs that generate about $1 million of annual
income. Statewide, 338 Physician Manpower Training Commission-assisted
physicians generate almost 16,000 jobs and $395 million in annual income. The
240 Physician Manpower Training Commission-assisted physicians in rural Oklahoma
create 12,000 jobs, producing annual income of $239 million.

In Stigler, the report showed that two physicians generated 107 annual jobs and
more than $2.3 million in annual income for the 2,500-resident community.

In Ada, the report showed that six doctors generated 252 annual jobs and annual
income of more than $7.16 million. Ada's population base includes more than
15,000 people.

Heart technology

Integris Heart Hospital at Baptist Medical Center has introduced the HeartScan,
a new technology that helps assess the risk of heart disease. The HeartScan
measures the level of calcification in the heart and coronary arteries through
the use of electron beam tomography. The process is non-surgical.

Donors needed

The Oklahoma Blood Institute reports that a new governmental regulation is
having a negative impact on the state's blood supply. Many regular donors are no
longer able to donate blood due to concerns about their potential risk of
exposure to variant Creutzfeltd-Jacob disease.

The new Food and Drug Administration regulation affects those who have spent
five years or more in Europe since 1989. Although there is no evidence that
variant Creutzfeltd-Jacob disease is transmissible through blood transfusions,
the institute must defer those donors until more is known about the transmission
of the disease.

As a result of the new regulation, the Oklahoma Blood Institute has seen a
decrease in donations since the regulation was implemented on May 31. The
decrease also coincides with an increased demand for blood.

New practice

Debra Davis Luther, a licensed psychological counselor, has opened a private
practice specializing in individual, marital and group psychotherapy. Luther
received a master's degree in counseling psychology from the University of
Central Oklahoma.

Offices are located at Jamestown Office Park, 3035 NW 63rd St.

Dentists for the disabled

Dentists for the Disabled and Elderly in Need of Treatment's sixth annual
fund-raiser -- the D-DENT Charity Classic VI -- is scheduled June 28 at the
Traditions Golf Club, 15200 Traditions Boulevard, in Edmond.

All proceeds from the Golf Classic directly benefit the D-DENT Program, which
has provided the low-income developmentally disabled and elderly citizens of
Oklahoma City free comprehensive dental care since 1986.

The four-man scramble is scheduled for an 8:30 a.m. shotgun start. Individual
registration is $75. Tournament sponsors include Bishop Paving. Delta Dental
Plan of Oklahoma, Federal Express, Great Southwest Dental Lab and Mega Supplies
Inc.

For more information, call Shirley Harris at 424-8092.

Mercy Health Center

Mercy Health Center participated in a clinical study of a new medical device
designed to open completely clogged arteries -- arteries once considered beyond
hope.

"Although we've had great success in going into narrowed arteries and performing
balloon angioplasties to open up arteries lined with plaque, we've been unable
to do anything when an artery is totally blocked with fatty deposits," said
Robert Kipperman, cardiologist and president of the of the Oklahoma Foundation
for Cardiovascular Research. "But with this study and a recently approved
FDA-approved device we're using at Mercy, we can open up totally blocked
arteries. This is a dramatic advance in the interventional treatment of totally
blocked arteries."

Water is priority for Cathy Livingston

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 623  words


The following information came from an emailed interview conducted by the Record
News and is a continuation of our 2014 municipal election coverage. Cathy
Livingston is up for reelection in the Bastard South Burgess ward in Rideau
Lakes Township.

Question 1: Can you give me a brief biography on yourself?

Answer: I live in the village of Delta and have my entire life. Born to parents
Ken and Joyce Gray I am the oldest of five girls. At a young age our parents
taught us how to be loving and giving to each other and to our community. I am
married to Ralph, 36 years, and we have an adult son Patrick James (PJ). For 39
years I worked at the Black and Decker Distribution Centre in Brockville, with
my last role as inventory management supervisor. In October 2012 the plant was
relocated to Mississauga. Since then I have taken on a part-time administrative
position with Spectrum Brands in Brockville.

Question 2: Is this your first election as a candidate and why have you chosen
to run in this year's election?

Answer: Yes this is my first election as a candidate; however I was chosen by
council in April 2014 after sending in my letter of interest to fill the
position that was left when Coun. Anders Carson resigned. So for the past five
months I have been a councillor for the Township of Rideau Lakes. It has been
quite an eye opener to learn the municipal procedures and policies, but I am
enjoying it.

Over the years with the support of my family I have been able to manage
volunteering with many organizations in Delta (i.e. the United Church, the Delta
Fair, the Maple Syrup Festival, the Delta Mill Society and others.)

Question 3: Can you explain your top three priority issues you would like to
work on if you are elected and why they are so important to you?

Answer: 1. Healthy drinking water is very important to everyone and it is
important to me that no one has to worry about the quality of their water
especially in the small rural communities where we are on well and septic
systems. I support studies for water quality and septic/waste upgrades to ensure
residents continue to have safe drinking water.

2. I support programs that will help control and sustain our environment by
working together with the conservation authorities and associations to find the
root cause and corrective action on issues of poor water quality, high water
levels, and by supporting programs that will help keep our environment clean.

3. I will support additional housing opportunities for seniors to keep them out
of long-term care facilities for as long as possible and that these facilities
also include daycare centres to help entice young families to the area. Having
daycares in a seniors' complex would not only be good for the children but also
the seniors.

Question 4: How do you see your community in the next 10 to 20 years?

Answer: I see it as place of growth while sustaining our over 200-year-old
heritage, the way it was in the days of my youth. I can see each village and
community within the township being sustainable so people can make the decision
to keep their money in the community. I see more home-based businesses in each
community that will bring in visitors to help sustain our local stores and
volunteer clubs. By working together with respect and harmony and with grant
opportunities I think this could be done.

Question 5: Is there anything you would like voters to know before they go to
the polls this fall?

Answer: I would like each and every person who is eligible to vote to do so. It
is easy you will be mailed a ballot around Sept. 18 and all you need to do is
put an X beside the person(s) you think will be the best candidate representing
you on council and then send it back in the mail. Remember Cathy cares!

John Muir's tax status at risk;
CONTRA COSTA: County to determine if the medical center's hospitals provide
enough charity care to maintain standing

BYLINE: Sandy Kleffman, CONTRA COSTA TIMES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. F4

LENGTH: 852 words


A union locked in a bitter contract dispute with John Muir Medical Center has
persuaded county Assessor Gus Kramer to explore whether its two hospitals
deserve their tax-exempt status.

Kramer said his office is analyzing whether the hospitals provide enough charity
care and other community benefits to qualify as nonprofit organizations.

He also is investigating whether John Muir should be allowed to keep its
tax-exempt status in light of its joint ventures with several for-profit
organizations.

Kramer launched the review at the request of Service Employees International
Union, United Healthcare Workers-West, which sent him a letter in January and
another one last week.

"We think they now are, in effect, a for-profit corporation," said Dana Simon,
the union's administrative vice president.

"At what point should these facilities be allowed to continue not paying
property taxes?" Simon asked. "It's this huge largesse that the public is giving
to this institution."

John Muir spokeswoman Patty Hefner called the union letters a negotiating tactic
designed to put pressure on hospital managers.

"Through a variety of vehicles, we provide a tremendous amount of charity care,"
Hefner said. "We know that what we're doing is appropriate."

The union has been embroiled for months in a battle with John Muir over a new
contract for 400 employees at the Concord campus, formerly known as Mt. Diablo
Medical Center.

The union held two-day strikes at the hospital in February and August. It
announced Thursday it will honor picket lines on Oct. 17 and 18 if the
California Nurses Association strikes the hospital as planned.

Kramer is a former union leader himself. He served years ago as president of
Public Employees Union, Local One, which represents many county workers.

Kramer declined to say when he will finish his review, but said he hopes to
complete it by the end of the year.

"It's not a high priority for us," he said. "I do have limited staff. We do them
as we can."

It remains unclear how aggressively his office is pursuing the matter. John Muir
officials say they have not been asked to provide documents or information
beyond what they normally send to the assessor's office.

"We're not aware of any investigation," Hefner said.

The issue of whether nonprofit hospitals provide adequate community benefits has
drawn national attention.

Such hospitals receive billions of dollars in tax breaks, with only vague
requirements about what they must provide in return.

The U.S. Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the issue last month.

In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, most private hospitals are nonprofit.

The state Board of Equalization flags for review any nonprofit hospital whose
operating revenue exceeds its operating expenses by 10 percent.

Last year, 15 hospitals statewide fell into that category, including John Muir,
which had $72 million in surplus revenues from 2002 to 2004, according to the
state agency. Sutter Delta Medical Center in Antioch also was on the list.

The Board of Equalization asked the hospitals for documentation on how they will
use the money. In May, it concluded that all of the hospitals planned to use the
revenue for allowable purposes and could keep their tax-exempt status.

John Muir noted that it plans to spend more than $500 million on new buildings
and upgrades at its Walnut Creek and Concord campuses to meet state seismic
requirements.

Union leaders argue that despite John Muir's financial success, it provides less
charity care than many other not-for-profit institutions, leaving other
institutions to fill the gaps.

In 2004, John Muir provided $1.7 million worth of charity care at its Walnut
Creek campus and $1.3 million at its Concord hospital.

Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo, which recently declared bankruptcy,
provided $3.5 million, while Sutter Delta Medical Center in Antioch provided $3
million.

Hefner said the hospital does many things that are not included in charity care
statistics. She estimated it contributed $22.7 million in community benefits in
2005, including mobile health and dental clinics, community seminars, and a $1
million a year community health fund that makes grants to local agencies.

Union leaders also complain about several joint ventures John Muir has
established with for-profit organizations, including an outpatient surgery
center that recently opened at the Concord hospital.

Other joint ventures include an ambulatory surgery center in Walnut Creek, and
magnetic imaging services.

In the letter to Kramer last week, union leaders noted that John Muir said in a
recent bond statement that it foresees more such joint ventures in the future.

"It's just wrong for this health care system to be using taxpayer resources,"
Simon argued.

Hefner stressed that such joint ventures pay property taxes. If John Muir did
not partner with the organizations, she added, the private groups would probably
set up operation near the hospital and drain away some of its revenue.

"The healthcare industry as a whole has been moving in this direction for
sometime now," Hefner said.

EPA offers assistance to help rural communities revitalize downtowns

LENGTH: 786  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington, DC: American Planning Association has issued the following news
release

  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) recently invited rural
communities to apply for planning assistance to develop strategies that help
grow the economy and revitalize downtown neighborhoods.





 EPA is offering this assistance as part of Rural Advantage, a suite of federal
economic development planning assistance programs for rural communities.



 "Rural Advantage is helping communities reinvent themselves in ways that are
good for the economy and the environment," said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy
in a news release. "We are excited to partner with communities that want to use
their unique rural assets to create a brighter, healthier future."



 Communities may apply for assistance through the following programs:



 Local Foods, Local Places (LFLP), which helps communities leverage local food
enterprise to diversify their economy and renew their downtowns.



 Cool & Connected, which helps communities use broadband service to create
walkable, connected, economically successful neighborhoods.



 Healthy Places for Healthy People, a new program that will help communities
partner with health care facilities to catalyze downtown revitalization and to
improve options for healthy living and economic opportunity.



 Rural Advantage is part of the Obama administration's commitment to place-based
strategies to help communities develop competitive advantages.



 In these places, federal experts are working side by side with residents and
local leaders to create customized solutions, bolstering coordination across
agencies and improving how we interact with and serve community partners.



 Under the Obama administration, EPA and federal partners have provided rural
advantage assistance to 83 communities to date. Sixty-eight communities have
been selected for assistance through Local Foods, Local Places, and 15
communities have received assistance through Cool & Connected, 10 of which are
in Appalachia.



 In 2012, Williamson, West Virginia , was selected to participate in the Livable
Communities in Appalachia program, the predecessor to LFLP. Through that effort,
a team of small-town development experts worked with Sustainable Williamson to
create an action plan tailored to achieving the town's goals, including
improving access to food to realize better health outcomes.



 Upon implementing the plan, Sustainable Williamson received an $80,000 planning
grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources
and Services Administration .



 That grant helped create a federally qualified health center that later
received an additional $650,000 to support clinic operations.



 Sustainable Williamson also established a downtown farmers' market and
community garden that increased access to healthy foods for Williamson
residents.



 The Williamson Health and Wellness Center also received LFLP assistance, in
2015, to provide support to new entrepreneurs starting up their businesses in
the local food and health care sectors, and to expand the community's innovative
approaches to creating a culture of health.



 In Montrose, Colorado , the Cool & Connected action plan helped advance
Proximity Space, an award-winning coworking project, and link it to the
community's efforts to build a walkable and investment-ready downtown.



 Coworking space allows people to access high-speed internet, conference rooms
and office equipment, and is one of many ways that small towns can leverage
broadband to boost main street development.



 Communities selected for this latest round of assistance will work with an EPA
-supported team of experts, including through a two-day workshop, to develop
strategies and action plans that enable them to realize their local
revitalization goals.



 The team will include people with expertise in community development and
representatives of the federal agencies that sponsor the three programs so
communities can build connections and take better advantage of federal programs
and resources.



 Working with federal partners, EPA will select 30 or more communities for
assistance through a competitive process.



 EPA 's Rural Advantage federal partners are the United States Departments of
Agriculture, Health and Human Services , Housing and Urban Development , and
Transportation, the Appalachian Regional Commission , the Delta Regional
Authority and the Economic Development Administration .



 Communities may apply by submitting letters of interest by Nov. 6 . For more
information and to submit an application, see: www.epa.gov/smartgrowth .

Sutter Health receives $1.2 million grant by California Initiative to Advance
Precision Medicine

   Nov 22, 2016

   The not-for-profit Sutter Health network was awarded $1.2 million by the
California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine to support patients with
multiple sclerosis--and help improve how we target and treat health matters
across the entire state.Sutter Health&#39s Research & Development team and
colleagues from the University of California, San Francisco will jointly develop
a software application called MS-SHARE. The neurology practice application will
be used to improve the precision of care for multiple sclerosis (MS). It will be
used by patients and doctors during appointments and by patients between
appointments. MS-SHARE will bring the latest findings from precision medicine,
along with information from the patient and their electronic health record
(EHR)&mdashright to the doctor&#39s fingertips. This app will organize both the
patient-reported data and the EHR data in a way that allows doctors and patients
to easily view it together to support their decision-making about care plans. In
this way, MS-SHARE has the potential to change how doctors and patients spend
their time during appointments. Instead of "data finding and gathering," doctors
and patients can devote more time to conversation about how the care is working
and how it needs to be changed to meet patient needs."In the digital age, we are
in a position to take research findings and more quickly apply them in the
doctor&#39s office&mdashsupporting patients and their health care teams today,"
said Walter "Buzz" Stewart, Ph.D., vice president and chief research officer for
Sutter Health and MS-SHARE project lead. "Through the app, care teams will
immediately see what&#39s working or not working for patients based on the data
and evidence. This empowers care teams and patients alike to make informed
decisions together with the benefit of the timeliest, most applicable
information." MS-SHARE also addresses limitations experienced with similar apps.
MS-SHARE can easily add new data sources and updated knowledge as they become
available and can quickly scale to new users and locations &mdashenhancing its
value and potential for impact. During the 18-month demonstration project with
the California Initiative to Advance Precision Medicine, Sutter Health will
build the app with input from Sutter doctors and MS patients, and focus on
short-term outcomes like patient and doctor use of the app and enhancing the
patient experience. The long-term goals of MS-SHARE are to improve patient
outcomes, including disease progression and symptom control. &nbspProgress and
findings from Sutter Health&#39s innovative project can reach far beyond
improving care for multiple sclerosis patientsit can help to lay the groundwork
for how to influence care and treatment for other neurological diseases as well,
such as Parkinson&#39s Disease, seizure disorders, and migraine headaches.
Precision medicine aims to use data driven tools and analysis to develop new
diagnostics, therapies and insights into disease. The winning teams receiving
CIAPM funding will join forces to utilize data across research, clinical,
environmental and population health settings to better diagnosis, treat and even
aim to better manage and prevent disease. &nbsp&nbsp The California Initiative
to Advance Precision Medicine was launched by the Governor in 2015 and received
additional funding in FY2016-2017. UC Health and UCSF host the initiative with
the Governor&#39s Office of Planning and Research.&nbsp


Sutter Health to Expand Breast Cancer Services in East Bay with $4 Million Gift

   Oct 25, 2016

   The Carol Ann Read Breast Health Center at Sutter Health's Alta Bates Summit
Medical Center in Oakland has received a $4 million gift from an anonymous
donor. The donation will be dedicated to improving early breast cancer
detection, treatment and patient support services for women in the East Bay.This
includes placing a high priority on breast cancer screening and treatment of
African-American women who are estimated to be 40 percent more likely to die of
breast cancer than Caucasian women according to the most recent statistics.With
this investment, the breast health center will expand access to advanced
screening technology and extensive patient navigation support systems across all
three Sutter-affiliated hospitals in the East Bay. This includes Alta Bates
Summit Medical Center in Oakland and Berkeley, Sutter Delta Medical Center in
Antioch, and Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley. "Women have a 1 in 8 chance
of being diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, and Sutter Health is
committed to increasing the detection and prevention of the disease and the
survival rates for all women in the East Bay," said Julie Petrini, CEO of
Hospitals, Sutter Health Bay Area. "By creating a regional breast cancer
program, we are proud to bring the same exceptional mammography screening,
treatment and compassionate support services provided at Carol Ann Read Breast
Health Center to our three Sutter hospitals. We hope that our efforts will serve
as a model for how all hospitals can come together to fight this disease and
win." To further accelerate the impact of this donation and help even more
women, Better Health East Bay, a Sutter Health regional philanthropic
foundation, has joined Susan G. Komen and Black Women&#39s Health Imperative to
launch the East Bay Breast Cancer Fund, a community fund managed by Community
Health Charities, to raise additional money to advance the goal of improving
breast health for all women in the region. This collaboration aims to match the
$4 million gift through corporate partnerships and employee workplace giving
programs in the East Bay. "We know breast cancer is a leading cause of death for
Black, Asian and Hispanic women, and we are proud to be part of the East Bay
Breast Cancer Fund, to ensure all women get screened starting at age 40 and
receive high-quality treatment, which will save lives," said Linda Goler Blount,
president and CEO of the Black Women&#39s Health Imperative. "Together, we can
help more women beat breast cancer so they can get back to the most important
things in their lives."&nbsp Research has shown that use of digital breast
tomosynthesis, also known as 3D mammography, in combination with standard
mammography, may improve breast cancer detection rates and reduce unnecessary
follow-up services for some patients. Patient navigator programs have also
proven highly effective in ensuring women get mammograms on a regular basis and
in preventing breast cancer treatment delays or interruptions. Applying the two
interventions has been shown to be a powerful combination. "This generous $4
million gift will serve as an important catalyst to expand our efforts to
provide state-of-the-art diagnostic tools and ongoing breast cancer support
services for many more women in the East Bay," said Jim Hickman, CEO of Better
Health East Bay, Sutter Health&#39s regional philanthropic foundation. "Thanks
to strong community partnerships and caring, compassionate donors right here in
the East Bay, we will save lives which is the most important outcome of all."

and the Leapfrog Group. Our software will help Sutter continue its leadership in
community-based care."


Sutter Memory Clinic Study Shows IVIG Could Be Key to Alzheimer's Cure

   Oct 12, 2015

   In a Sutter Institute of Medical Research study published this month in the
Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, the blood product
intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, was found to reduce brain atrophy and
cognitive decline in patients in the early, pre-dementia phase of Alzheimer's
disease.IVIG, extracted from the plasma of more than 1,000 blood donors,
contains antibodies to amyloid, an abnormal brain protein found in patients with
Alzheimer's disease. Sutter Institute of Medical Research, in partnership with
Sutter Neuroscience Institute and Sutter Neuroradiology, designed the study to
investigate if a course of IVIG could have practical, disease-modifying effects
on Alzheimer's disease when administered during the pre-dementia phase. The
study showed promising results during the first year after treatment in the form
of reduced brain atrophy as well as reduced conversions to Alzheimer's disease
dementia at one year, compared with a placebo group."This research shows some
evidence that IVIG could prevent brain atrophy and delay the onset of
Alzheimer's disease in patients who are in the beginning stages," said Shawn
Kile, M.D., Sutter Neuroscience Institute neurologist, co-medical director of
the groundbreaking Sutter Memory Clinic and principal investigator of the IVIG
study. "My hope is that our study will lead to additional investigations of this
treatment strategy so we can eventually conquer this devastating disease." This
randomized, double-blinded trial administered from 2011-2013 included 50
patients 50-84 years old who were referred to Sutter Neuroscience Institute and
its specialized Sutter Memory Clinic in Sacramento. Participants were diagnosed
with amnestic mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. The
participants were administered either IVIG or saline solutions every two weeks
for a total of five infusions. Brain imaging was conducted at baseline, at 12
months and again at 24 months. The images at 12 months for those who received
the IVIG doses showed less brain atrophy than those who were given the placebo.
In addition, cognitive testing showed better results and there we less
conversions to dementia after 12 months for those who received IVIG. These
differences in the treatment groups faded by 24 months. Dr. Kile and colleagues
propose that annual infusions of IVIG may be necessary to sustain treatment
effects, but additional research will be necessary to prove this. "There has
been no new medical treatment to combat Alzheimer's disease over the last 10
years," said William Au, M.D., a renowned neurologist and expert in the
treatment of Alzheimer's disease and co-director of the Sutter Memory Clinic.
"This study of IVIG in mild cognitive impairment may be the beginning of
research that could hold the key to finding a cure for this terrible illness."


Sutter Health and National Research Collaborate to Improve the Patient
Experience

   Sep 22, 2015

   Sutter Health and National Research Corporation announced a collaboration to
conduct the not-for-profit health system's patient experience measurement that
will offer feedback on how to enhance patient care delivery.Sutter Health
recently created the Office of Patient Experience, which focuses on new ways for
doctors and other clinicians to closely partner with patients and their families
to provide innovative, personalized care that optimizes quality and
safety."National Research and their teams will help us better connect with our
patients and better understand their needs," said Don Wreden, M.D., Senior Vice
President of Patient Experience. "Personalized healthcare starts with listening
to our patients. Understanding their preferences is the foundation to building
trusting relationships with them." National Research begins sending surveys to
Sutter Health patients this month via email, phone, and standard mail. From
primary care to end of life care, the work of National Research spans all
patient touch points. This includes meeting the patients' needs for a safe
transition from one care setting to another and precisely representing the
voices of patients and their loved ones. Sutter Health will benefit from
National Research's expertise, best practice knowledge, and networking
opportunities. "Through our initial dialogue with Sutter Health, it was very
clear that their patients are at the center of their organizational decision
making -- and they should be," said Jason Stevens, Senior Vice President of
Business Development at National Research. "It's thrilling to work with an
organization so committed to nurturing healthy communities."


CVS Health Announces New Clinical Affiliations with Four Leading Health Care
Organizations

   Jun 24, 2015

   CVS Health announced it has entered into new clinical affiliations with
Sutter Health in California, Millennium Physician Group in Florida, Bryan Health
Connect in Nebraska and Mount Kisco Medical Group, PC in New York. These
affiliations will help enhance access to high-quality, affordable health care
services for patients. Through these clinical affiliations, CVS Health will
provide prescription and visit information to the participating health care
organizations by enabling communication between our secured electronic health
record (EHR) systems, which will help enhance clinical care for patients served
by the partnering organizations. In addition, patients will continue to have
access to clinical support, medication counseling, chronic disease monitoring
and wellness programs at CVS/pharmacy stores and MinuteClinic, the retail
medical clinic of CVS Health."In this era of health care reform, we are pleased
to work with these health care organizations to develop collaborative programs
that enhance access to patient care, improve health outcomes and lower health
care costs in the communities they serve," said Troyen A. Brennan, MD, Chief
Medical Officer, CVS Health. "By allowing our electronic health records and
information systems to communicate and share important information about the
patients we collectively serve, we will have a more comprehensive view of our
patients, which can aid in health care decision making and help ensure patients
adhere to important medications for chronic diseases." CVS/pharmacy currently
has more than 7,800 retail pharmacy locations across the U.S. where CVS
pharmacists provide counseling to patients to help them be adherent to their
chronic disease medications. In addition, MinuteClinic also plays an important
role by providing patients with timely, affordable and high-quality walk-in
health care. There are nearly 1,000 MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics
available at CVS/pharmacy retail stores. MinuteClinic locations are open seven
days a week, offering evening hours with no appointment necessary and most
health insurance is accepted. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and
physician assistants who provide treatment for common family illnesses and
administer wellness and prevention services, including health-condition
monitoring for patients with chronic diseases. Affiliates' health care providers
will receive data on interventions conducted by CVS pharmacists to improve
medication adherence for their patients. The affiliation also encourages
collaboration between the health care providers and MinuteClinic providers to
improve coordination of care for patients seen at MinuteClinic locations.
Through this collaboration, the affiliate organizations and MinuteClinic
practitioners will also work together on planning strategies around chronic care
and wellness. If more comprehensive care is needed, patients can follow up with
their primary care provider and have access to the services at the health care
provider as appropriate. For those patients who do not have regular access to
health care, MinuteClinic provides information to help patients in finding a
primary care physician and a greater opportunity for continuity of health care
services. MinuteClinic, CVS/pharmacy and the participating health care
organizations will begin to work toward streamlining and enhancing communication
through their EHR systems. This will include the electronic sharing of messages
and alerts from CVS/pharmacy to the health care organizations' physicians
regarding medication non-adherence issues. In addition, MinuteClinic will
electronically share patient visit summaries with the patient's primary care
physician when they are part of an affiliate organization and with the patient's
consent. MinuteClinic will continue its standard practice of sending patient
visit summaries to primary care providers who are not affiliated with one of
these participating health care organizations via fax or mail, with patient
consent. The new affiliations announced here bring the total number of clinical
collaborations for CVS Health and MinuteClinic to nearly 60 major health systems
and health care providers across the country.

Sutter Delta Supports National Wound Care Awareness Week June 2-6

   May 30, 2014

   The Advanced Wound Care & Hyperbaric Center at Sutter Delta Medical Center is
partnering locally with Healogics, the country's largest provider in wound care
services, to raise awareness in East Contra Costa County about chronic wounds
affecting millions of people in the U.S. During National Wound Care Awareness
Week, staff from the medical center's will dedicate an entire week to work with
local providers to educate patients and their loved ones about the dangers of
non-healing wounds and advanced therapies available to patients. Program
directors across the nation will dedicate the entire week to visiting local
physician offices to provide education to help staff identify patients that may
benefit from advanced wound careChronic wounds affect millions of people in the
U.S. and the incidence is rising, fueled by an aging population and increasing
rates of diseases and conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and the late effects
of radiation therapy. Untreated, chronic wounds can lead to a diminished quality
of life and possible amputation of the affected limb. "There are many patients
living with non-healing wounds that are unaware of treatments available in their
local communities," said Ray Rassai, MD, FACS, medical director of Sutter
Delta's Advanced Wound Care & Hyperbaric Center. "Adjunctive therapies for
appropriate patients can help heal wounds faster than traditional methods. We
want to make advanced wound care available to all patients who would would
benefit, but we must educate the communities we serve about the services we
offer."

$2 Million Awarded to Sutter Health, IBM and Geisinger Health System to Study
Heart Failure Prediction

   Oct 09, 2013

   Today, Sutter Health, IBM Research (IBM) and Geisinger Health System announce
the award of a $2 million joint research grant from the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to develop new and sophisticated big data analytics and application
methods that could help doctors detect heart failure years sooner than is now
possible.Heart disease is the leading cause of death, disability and costly
hospitalizations in the United States. One in five adults will develop heart
failure, a type of heart disease that remains nearly impossible to detect early.
About half of people who have heart failure die within five years of
diagnosis.The Research Project Sutter Health, IBM and Geisinger Health System
will use the NIH funding to develop practical and cost-effective early-detection
methods for application in primary care practices with an electronic health
record (EHR) system. The research aims to:Create a deeper understanding of how
to use the data contained within EHRs and advanced analytics to help detect
heart failure earlier. Identify best practices that help health systems
nationwide integrate big data analytics into primary care. This "Smarter Care"
approach will help doctors and caregivers use evidence-based insights to better
partner with patients and identify more tailored treatment options and holistic
approaches to disease management that are personalized for each individual. EHR
data provides a rich, expansive view of a patient's health history that may
include a variety of big data, including demographics, medical history,
medication and allergies, laboratory test results, and more. Sophisticated
analysis of this data could help doctors identify patient's risk of heart
failure and reveal signals and patterns that are indicative of such outcome.
Once patients are identified as high-risk for heart failure, physicians can
better monitor their status, help motivate a patient to make potentially
life-saving lifestyle changes and test clinical interventions to potentially
slow or possibly reverse heart failure progression. "Heart failure will remain
among our nation's most deadly and costly diseases unless we discover new
methods to detect the illness much earlier," said Walter "Buzz" Stewart, Ph.D.,
MPH, chief research and development officer for Sutter Health and principal
investigator for the project. "Sophisticated analysis of EHR data could reveal
the unique presentation of these symptoms at earlier stages and allow doctors
and patients to work together sooner to do something about it. Through this
research we could transform how heart failure is managed in the future." "IBM is
applying advanced tools for analyzing medical data, including text, and
reviewing a patient's health records for new insight," said Shahram Ebadollahi,
Ph.D., program director, Health Informatics Research for IBM T.J. Watson
Research Center and co-principal investigator for the project. "By pairing IBM's
expertise in Big Data analytics with the domain knowledge and data of our
healthcare partners this project will result in the development of new analytic
algorithms for more accurate detection of the early onset of heart failure.
Ultimately, we hope to advance a smarter approach to care for patients with
heart failure." Steve Steinhubl, M.D., a cardiologist member of the research
team from Geisinger, added, "Our earlier research showed that signs and symptoms
of heart failure in patients are often documented years before a diagnosis and
that the pattern of documentation can offer clinically useful signals for early
detection of this deadly disease. Now we have the technology to enable earlier
diagnosis and intervention of serious conditions like heart failure, leading to
better outcomes for patients."The three parties began their initial research in
2009 and published a series of findings in medical journals and conferences.
Prediction modeling using EHR data: challenges, strategies, and a comparison of
machine learning approaches Automatic identification of heart failure diagnostic
criteria, using text analysis of clinical notes from electronic health records
Combining knowledge and data driven insights for identifying risk factors using
electronic health records The NIH funding allows the team to look deeper into
the progression of factors that are predictors of heart failure so clinicians
can implement timely care-management plans to improve health outcomes. They will
begin testing predictive methods for heart failure in clinical practice over the
next several years. Their findings may also provide insights for providers to
use EHR data to improve health outcomes for other chronic conditions.


Sutter Health Launches Advanced Care Program In El Dorado And Placer Counties

   Jun 05, 2013

   Sutter Health launched Advanced Illness Management (AIM) program in Solano,
Sonoma and San Mateo counties recently, as well as in the East Bay Region and in
San Francisco. The expansion extends access to eligible Sutter Auburn Faith
Hospital and Sutter Medical Group-Sutter Independent Physicians patients in
portions of El Dorado and Placer counties.The AIM program provides nurse-led
care management, palliative care, and advance care planning for patients with
late-stage chronic illness. With a pilot program in Sutter Health's Sacramento
Sierra Region showing positive outcomes, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid
Innovation (CMMI) awarded Sutter Health a three-year, $13m Health Care
Innovation Award to support the expansion of AIM throughout Northern
California.Brad Stuart, senior medical director for Sutter Care at Home, an
affiliate of Sutter Health, said, "AIM uses a nurse-led interdisciplinary team
to bridge the gaps between the hospital, the community physician's office, and
home for our sickest patients. Quality, affordable care for all of our patients
is a priority and the expansion of AIM systemwide complements our mission and
values. AIM supports giving the right care, at the right time, at the right
level of care for the patient's goals." Sutter Health's pilot program showed
reduced hospitalizations and improved care transitions, contributing to an
improved quality of life for patients enrolled in AIM. The success of the pilot
program was crucial to Sutter Health receiving the CMMI grant. Since 2010, the
pilot AIM program: Reported a 75% reduction in ICU days, an average decrease of
one or more days for hospital stays, and more than 50% reduction in
hospitalizations at 90 days post-enrollment Showed high patient and family
satisfaction (4.7 out of 5) Reduced costs for payers by $5,000 per patient at 90
days post-enrollment.


Sutter Health To Establish Administrative Service Center In Roseville,
California

   Oct 10, 2012

   Sutter Health announced that it will establish a major administrative service
center in Roseville, California to support the network's Northern California
health care operations. The center is expected to employ more than 1,000
administrative support staff over the next 18 months. The center's workforce is
expected to grow more over time.Pat Fry, President and CEO, Sutter Health, said,
"Sutter Health is one of Northern California's largest employers, and we've been
a key part of the region's economy and health care delivery system for nearly a
century. The selection of Roseville for our service center represents another
significant long-term commitment to support and grow within Northern
California."The creation of a central administrative service hub is part of an
effort to transform how Sutter Health delivers business support services across
its growing network of care. Services such as finance, billing, human resources
and other non-patient care functions will move to the Roseville center.
Currently, these services are provided in dozens of separate Northern California
locations, including patient care sites. Sutter Health leaders said that
delivering business support services from a common location will result in more
efficient best-practice processes and better customer service. Relocating
business support services from hospitals and clinic facilities will also free up
critical space for patient care services. Fry said, "Sutter Health has
demonstrated that working together and following best clinical practices results
in better health care. We owe it to our patients to deliver all our services
including business support functions in the highest-quality and most efficient
way." Scheduled to open in early 2013, the center will be located in a nearly
300,000sq ft office building in west Roseville. Tenant improvements will begin
immediately and the first group of 200 to 300 employees will move into the
facility in the first quarter of 2013. Additional employees will follow, in
phases. Sutter Health's lease includes an option to expand the Roseville site to
accommodate additional employees, if necessary in the future. Sutter Health
considered multiple locations for its center. Factors that influenced the
selection of Roseville included proximity to affordable housing for employees,
the Sacramento region's top colleges and universities and the skilled talent
pools these schools provide.


Sutter Health Files For Knox-Keene License

   Sep 14, 2012

   Sutter Health filed an application with the California Department of Managed
Care (DMHC) for a Knox-Keene License. If the application is approved, the
not-for-profit health care network intends to offer a Sutter-operated and
sponsored health plan.Pat Fry, President and CEO of Sutter Health, said,
"Offering a health plan enables us to partner directly with patients to manage
their total health needs, including their ongoing care experience and the total
quality and cost of their care. The Knox-Keene License filing represents our
first formal step toward delivering the type of high-value health plan products
that consumers and employers want and expect. Our proposed Sutter-sponsored
health plan will be locally run, and will provide superb service and the great
quality we're known for, along with competitive rates."Sutter Health has
experience with managing health plans, having operated an health maintenance
organization (HMO) during the 1990s. Fry said that the timing is right for a
Sutter-sponsored plan, noting the growth in Sutter Health's 5,000-member Sutter
Medical Network of doctors, its two-dozen acute care hospitals and robust
outpatient and home health network. Peter Anderson, senior vice president of
strategy and business development at Sutter Health, said, "Employers have been
asking us to find a way for them to have direct relationships with Sutter
Health. We're also seeing the emergence of new care delivery models, such as
accountable care organizations (ACOs) and new care approaches from the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). A Knox-Keene License gives us greater
flexibility to participate." With DMHC's approval, Sutter Health will offer a
range of HMO products for small and mid-sized employers. If awarded a Knox-Keene
License, Sutter Health expects HMO products would first become available in the
greater Sacramento and Central Valley regions in early 2014. Sutter Health will
also seek the DMHC's approval to extend its service area to other parts of
Sutter's service area. Sutter Health will continue to contract with and care for
patients covered by other commercial health plans as well as MediCal and
Medicare.

   Jan 04, 2012

   Sutter Health announced a contribution of $400m to the Sutter Health
Retirement Plan to support more than 45,000 employees upon retirement and to
keep the network's pension plan fully funded.Pat Fry, president and CEO of
Sutter Health, said, "At a time when companies are downsizing or eliminating
employee pensions, Sutter Health has made funding our pension a top priority.
Employees deserve to know that when they retire, the money they worked so hard
for will be there for them."Gerry Brinton, chair of board of directors of Sutter
Health, said, "Employees are the ones who make health care happen. It isn't the
buildings, it isn't the equipment â[#x20ac]" it's the employees that actually
utilize those things. Providing a generous pension is just one way Sutter
recognizes and rewards the skills and abilities of employees who choose to work
for our network." By the numbers | Sutter Health's pension plan and benefits In
the Sutter Health network, a 52-year-old nurse working full-time who retires in
2024 at age 65 can expect to receive about $7,000 per month or $84,000 per year
at retirement from the Sutter Health pension plan (not including possible income
from investment in a 403(b) plan or from Social Security.) Sutter Health's
pension is one of many employee benefits, including health insurance at low or
no cost, paid time off, education assistance, 403(b) plan, and a retiree health
care account at many locations. Sutter Health's retention rates for employees
and registered nurses within acute care facilities ranks better than the
California average. Sutter's retention rates among registered nurses for 2010
stood at 95% compared to 93% statewide, as reported by the California Hospital
Association. To keep the employee pension plan fully funded, the not-for-profit
health system invested $120m in plan year 2010 and $500m in 2008. In 2011,
Sutter Health's consistent record of significant pension plan contributions was
recognized by Standard & Poor's, with the credit agency noting Sutter Health's
employee retirement plan as among the reasons it upgraded the not-for-profit
network's credit rating to AA- in January. Sutter Health also was named by
Standard & Poor's as one of the top 10 highest funded defined-benefit pension
plans nationwide among not-for-profit health care providers.


Scan Foundation Announces Funding To Study Better Care Coordination For Patients
With Chronic Illness

   Dec 16, 2011

   A new research project, funded by The Scan Foundation, will study Sutter
Health's Advanced Illness Management (AIM) program to determine how to expand
AIM as a national best-practice model. The Scan Foundation will fund Avalere
Health, a national health policy consulting firm, to support analysis of the AIM
program's patient outcomes data to help determine how to take AIM to scale.Brad
Stuart, CMO of Sutter Care at Home, said, "Preliminary studies show that AIM
better meets patients' wishes, and ensures they receive the highest quality care
and experience specific to their needs. This ultimately improves a patient's
overall care experience while reducing health care costs."Over half of all
people with advanced chronic illness have multiple conditions and complex care
needs. All of us in the health care industry must transform the way we care for
our most seriously ill patients so they remain as independent and comfortable as
possible, avoid unnecessary hospital admissions, and receive the care they
want." The Scan Foundation is dedicated to creating a society in which seniors
receive medical treatment and human services that are integrated in the setting
most appropriate to their needs. Sutter Care at Home is an affiliate of Sutter
Health, providing a wide array of home care, home-based and hospice services.
Sutter Health's AIM program helps coordinate health care services--hospital,
outpatient and home care--so that the right care is delivered at the right time,
in the right place, according to each patient's specific wishes and needs.
Implemented by Sutter Care at Home, AIM was launched out of the Sutter Medical
Network in 2009 and operates in the greater Sacramento area. Preliminary outcome
data published in the March 2011 issue of Health Affairs showed that patients
had fewer hospitalizations while enrolled in AIM, resulting in an average
savings of $2,000 per patient per month.

executives and Humanitarian of the Year by UCP Sacramento.Krevans holds master's
degrees in both business administration and public health from the University of
California, Berkeley and a bachelor's degree from Boston University.


Sutter Health's Heart Failure Program Receives New Joint Commission
Certification

   Jul 28, 2011

   The Sutter Heart & Vascular Institute Heart Failure Clinic received new Joint
Commission certification. The Joint Commission standards are focused on
providing safe, successful transitions of care as heart-failure patients move
from the inpatient setting to the outpatient setting.In collaboration with the
American Heart Association, The Joint Commission launched the advanced
certification in heart failure program on July 1, 2011 by using criteria
outlined in the AHA's Get With The Guidelines. These clinical practice
guidelines include recommendations related to assessment, monitoring, management
and performance improvement of heart failure care across health-care
settings.After a thorough review of the Sutter Heart & Vascular Institute's
program, the Heart Failure Clinic at Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento was found
to meet all of the guidelines to promote successful efforts in heart failure
management. John Chin, medical director of the Sutter Heart & Vascular Institute
Transplant and Advanced Heart Therapy Department, said, "Our Heart Failure
Clinic has produced some of the best outcomes in the nation, not only for
successful heart-failure treatments, but for excellence in continued care. Most
heart-failure patients need to be seen for the rest of their lives, and our goal
is to improve both their longevity and the quality of their lives." Sutter Heart
& Vascular Institute is reportedly the only heart program in Northern California
outside the Bay Area to offer advanced heart-failure treatments, including heart
transplants, rescue devices and heart pumps known as ventricular assist devices.
Its Heart Failure Clinic is located on the SMCS campus of Sutter Memorial
Hospital in East Sacramento and sees hundreds of patients a month. The goal of
the Heart Failure Clinic is to prevent unnecessary emergency department visits
and hospital admissions, promote consistency in the use of medications, and
promote better self-management through patient education and lifestyle changes.
Jean Range, executive director of The Joint Commission's Disease-Specific Care
Certification program, said, "Although there is no cure for heart failure, the
proper treatment program can allow patients to lead full lives. The Joint
Commission's certification program will help health care organizations focus on
the care processes that produce the best outcomes for their heart failure
patients and give patients with heart failure confidence that these health care
organizations are committed to quality care."


Sutter Health To Launch Electronic Health Record System

Apr 04, 2011

Sutter Health announced plans to launch an electronic health record (EHR)
offering, Sutter Community Connect-to qualified physicians in independent
practice. The Epic-based software option expands Sutter Health's sizeable
investment in building a fully integrated EHR system that enables more seamless
effective and efficient care coordination for our patients.Physicians practicing
in the more than 100 Northern California communities that Sutter Health serves
gain another EHR option as they look for affordable, easy-to-use software
systems designed specifically for independent practices. Sutter Community
Connect offers a full software suite that includes a robust EHR for clinical
care management and software applications for registration, scheduling and
billing. This complete EHR is 2011/2012 compliant and has been certified by the
Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT), an ONC-ATCB,
in accordance with the applicable certification criteria for eligible providers
and hospitals adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This
certification does not represent an endorsement by the US Department of Health
and Human Services or guarantee the receipt of incentive payments.Jeff Burnich,
senior vice president and executive officer of the Sutter Medical Network, said,
"Technology plays a large role in integrating services across any number of
clinicians and care settings. Our patients will benefit from more seamless hand
offs that can boost outcomes and efficiencies, which ultimately means more
quality, affordable care. To truly reinvent care, we see an imperative to
connect as many physicians across our network as possible by extending an EHR
option to community doctors in independent practice." Regional hospital
corporations within the Sutter Health not-for-profit network will make in-kind
donations to qualifying independent physicians that cover up to 85% of software
and related implementation costs. Sutter Physician Services, a health care
management and administrative services arm of Sutter Health, will oversee the
roll out of Sutter Community Connect beginning the summer of 2011. Sutter Health
has already installed an Epic-based EHR system in each of its medical
foundations, and continues its systemwide acute-care implementation in
affiliated hospitals. Sutter Health's EHR connects more than 12,000 caregivers
serving more than one million patients in Northern California. Nearly 450,000
patients use Sutter Health's online services â[#x20ac]" My Health Online

Transition Of Marin General Hospital To Marin Healthcare District Complete

Jun 30, 2010

Sutter Health has transferred operations of Marin General Hospital (MGH) in
Greenbrae, California to the Marin Healthcare District (MHD), which owns the
facility. As of midnight MHD resumed operations of MGH and the hospital is no
longer affiliated with Sutter Health.The transition of MGH from Sutter Health to
MHD is the result of 2006 settlement and transfer agreements negotiated and
signed by Sutter Health, the Marin General Hospital Corporation and MHD, and
approved by the Marin Superior Court. The agreements governed the roles,
responsibilities and financial obligations of Sutter Health and the MHD, and
specified the amount of money that would remain with the hospital at the time of
the transfer.Sutter Health's long-held policy of pooling financial resources for
the benefit of the communities it serves was accepted and adopted by the MHD
board. Sutter Health offered to build a new seismically-safe hospital at a cost
of hundreds of millions of dollars and at no cost to taxpayers. However, the MHD
declined that offer. Martin Brotman, president of Sutter Health, said: ''We
applaud the dedicated and talented physicians, nurses and staff of MHD and the

Sutter Health Receives Multimillion Dollar Grant To Further Improve Patient Care


May 06, 2010

The Betty Irene Moore Nursing Initiative of the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation has awarded the not-for-profit Sutter Health network a third
multimillion-dollar grant for further expansion of its patient safety programs
through the development of best practices in patient care.Beyond the
foundation's $3.6m grant, Sutter Health committed an additional $7.2m, bringing
the total funds dedicated to further advancing clinical quality and patient
safety to more than $10m over the next two years.The latest grant and matching
funds will focus on quality improvement in two specific clinical areas and by
implementing ongoing staff education to ensure that every patient receives the
right care, at the right time, and in the right location. Through the grant,
Sutter Health will implement new approaches to reduce the incidence and
mortality rates of severe sepsis and septic shock. These are serious conditions
that spread through the bloodstream and can lead to organ failure and death. The
grant and matching funds also will support programs to reduce the number of
patients experiencing hypo and hyperglycemic episodes (significant fluctuations
in blood sugar) and improve the number of patients maintaining blood glucose
within normal ranges. In addition to clinical goals, the grant will further
implement quality improvement programs to support RN leadership and development
and foster improved communication among medical personnel, administration and
patients. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation previously awarded the Sutter
Health network nearly $8.3m to expand and develop model patient safety programs
in six of its Bay Area hospitals. This latest grant expands Sutter Health and
the foundation's partnership to include hospitals in the greater Sacramento
region. John Mesic, chief medical officer and vice president of integrated
quality services for the Sutter Health Sacramento Sierra Region, said, Our
desire is to change the fundamental approach to the culture of care we provide
our patients on a daily basis. Sutter's ongoing partnership with the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation allows us to study the effectiveness of these changes, as
well as the improvement in patient care.


Sutter Health Reports Net Income Of $697m For 2009

Apr 09, 2010

Sutter Health reported a net income of $697m compared to $187m for 2008.
Operating revenues were $8.8 billion for 2009, compared to $8.3 billion for
2008.Operating expenses were $8.3 billion for 2009, compared to $7.8 billion for
2008.Pat Fry, president and CEO of Sutter Health, said, Given the economic
challenges of 2009, Sutter Health was fortunate to have essentially maintained
its operating performance from the previous year while achieving record levels
of clinical quality. The market recovery in 2009, combined with our prudent
investment strategies, resulted in a sizable gain from investments. However, the
2009 gain didn't completely offset the investment-related losses of 2008, Fry
added.

Antioch

TWO ACCUSED OF KILLING FACE DEATH PENALTY: Two Antioch men who prosecutors say
are members of a Latino gang must stand trial for the September 2004 killing and
attempted robbery of a man on his way to work.

Eric "E-Lo" Anderson, 21, and Randy Salazar, 23, must answer charges of murder
with gang enhancements, a judge ruled Thursday after a preliminary hearing.
Anderson is also charged with using a firearm.

They had pleaded not guilty after their arrest in October 2004.

Prosecutors are adding the special circumstance of murder in the commission of a
robbery, said deputy district attorney Mary Knox, making both men eligible for
the death penalty if convicted.

Prosecutors say 20-year-old Mathew Stephens was on his way to work in San
Francisco at 4:30 a.m. on East Lake Court near East Lake Drive in Antioch. The
two men approached him soon after he turned on the ignition, intending to steal
his car, Knox said.

Anderson shot Stephens in the head, Knox said. The two then panicked and fled.

Two witnesses refused to testify at the preliminary hearing, even under a grant
of immunity, for fear of retribution, Knox said.

Brannan Island

WOMAN PULLED UNCONSCIOUS FROM DELTA WATERS: A woman was in serious but stable
condition Monday after Coast Guard crews found her unconscious and floating in
the chilly Delta waters.

About 9:12 a.m. boaters at the Outrigger Marina reported seeing a woman drifting
in Threemile Slough near Brannan Island.

The boaters drew next to the unconscious woman and were trying to pull her out
of the water when Coast Guard boats arrived and pulled her safely onto their
boat, Coast Guard Officer Alex Saldana said.

The unconscious woman was flown by helicopter to John Muir Medical Center in
Walnut Creek, where she was treated for hypothermia.

Authorities are investigating how the woman got into the water and how long she
was there. Her identity was not released Monday evening.

Castro Valley

EDEN MEDICAL CENTER PROMISES LOCKOUT: Eden Medical Center plans to lock out
employees who went on strike a week ago until a contract between hospital
management and the union representing the strikers has been reached.

"The decision was not an easy one, by any means," said Cassandra Phelps,
hospital spokeswoman. Phelps said employees who did cross the picket line are
asking the pickets not to return to work because it would be demoralizing to
them.

The Service Employee International Union United Healthcare Workers West Local
250 strike officially ended today at 6 a.m.

Hospital management and union representatives will return to the negotiation
table at noon today. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, will mediate the session
at a Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services office in Oakland.

Some 300 vocational nurses, nursing assistants, operating room technicians and
other hospital workers at the Castro Valley hospital, represented by the union,
went on strike Feb. 28.

Oakland

LABOR DISPUTE FOCUSES ON FINANCIAL REPORT: A contract dispute between the school
district and the teachers union heated up Monday.

Oakland Unified School District officials made public letters to the district
from the state education officials and school funding experts who back the
district's suggestion that a fact-finding report on the district's finances is
not telling the whole story.

The report, released in January, says that the district has more money for
teacher salaries than it is claiming because of a higher volume of one-time
revenue sources this year.

The letters, addressed to State Administrator Randolph Ward, disputed the report
by saying the district should not use one-time revenues for expenses such as
raises in teachers' salaries.

Ben Visnick, president of the Oakland Education Association, said bargaining
members will continue to use the report as the foundation for negotiating a
contract with the district.

Visnick, who attended the district's Monday news conference, said a strike vote
is likely at the OEA's March 22 membership meeting.

Pittsburg

MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN RAPE CASE: A Pittsburg man has pleaded not guilty to
charges he raped a 15-year-old female classmate while both were attending a
private school in Massachusetts in 2004.

Ramone Wellington, 19, is one of several former students from Winchendon School,
the private school charged in the case. All five are former members of the prep
school's basketball team.

No details of the alleged rape have been made public.

Wellington was arraigned Thursday in Worcester Superior Court on a charge of
statutory rape of a child, assistant district attorney Anthony Marotta said. The
arraignment came after Wellington was arrested in California on a default
warrant for failing to appear at a scheduled arraignment in October, he added.

Wellington is being held on bail of $100,000.

The Winchendon School, in north-central Massachusetts, plays in the elite New
England Prep School Athletic Council and recruits players from all over the
country who often go on to play Division I college and professional basketball.

Richmond

COUNCILWOMAN TO RUN FOR MAYOR: Councilwoman Gayle McLauglin, the city's only
elected Green Party member, has declared her candidacy for mayor as the coming
political season begins to take shape.

McLauglin made her announcement to about 75 supporters who jammed into the
Richmond Memorial Convention Center's Catalina Room on Sunday.

McLauglin is the second mayoral candidate to formally announce a bid for the
November election. The first was former Councilman Gary Bell, who lost his
council seat in 2004.

Mayor Irma Anderson has not announced whether she will seek re-election, but her
staffers say it is no secret that she intends to run. Councilman John Marquez
said he is also seriously considering entering the race.

McLauglin is one of 26 elected Greens in the Bay Area who have won seats on city
councils, school boards and special districts. Statewide, there are 64 elected
Greens, though none holds state office.

Robber convicted of murder:

A federal jury has convicted a man of fatally shooting a teller during a 2007
holdup of a Chicago bank. David Vance was accused of first-degree murder in the
death of 23-year-old Tramaine Gibson, who was shot after he was unable to open a
vault during the robbery of Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan on May 22,
2007. A bank patron and a bank guard were wounded during the robbery, which
netted the robbers $6,000. In addition to presenting eyewitness accounts,
videotape of the robbery and DNA evidence, prosecutors also called co-defendant
Alton Marshall to testify. Marshall, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to avoid the
death penalty, identified Vance as an accomplice. A third suspect, Henry
Bluford, also pleaded guilty in 2009.

Quinn to sign Dream Act:

A spokesman says Gov. Pat Quinn will sign a bill to allow the children of
immigrants, both legal and illegal, to get private college scholarships and
enroll in state college savings programs. Quinn spokesman Grant Klinzman says
the governor will sign the bill Monday. Called the Illinois Dream Act, the
measure creates a panel to raise private money for college scholarships.
Supporters say this will help illegal immigrants who graduate from Illinois high
schools go on to college because they may otherwise not be able to afford it.
Students must have at least one immigrant parent and must have attended school
in Illinois for at least three years to qualify for scholarship money. Opponents
say the legislation wrongly helps people who violate immigration laws.

Ex-mayor's home sold:

The home of a former Cicero mayor convicted of fraud has sold as the government
attempts to recoup some of the money she owes. The home of Betty Loren-Maltese
was auctioned Thursday for $87,000. Loren-Maltese, who watched the auction, told
the Chicago Sun-Times the son of a neighbor bought the three-bedroom property.
Loren-Maltese served 6 1/2 years in prison for fleecing taxpayers of more than
$12 million in a mob-related insurance scam. She's been released from prison.
She says she's innocent and has appealed the conviction. She now lives in an
apartment in Palos Hills.

Metra train kills pedestrian:

An inbound Metra train struck and killed a pedestrian Friday afternoon in
Naperville.The accident, which caused several delays and cancellations for the
Burlington Northern-Santa Fe line, took place about a quarter-mile east of the
Naperville station at 4:15 p.m., said Metra spokesman Michael Gillis.The train
involved in the accident remained on scene; however, passengers were transferred
to another train, Gillis said.No other people were injured, Gillis said.

Chicago faces $635M deficit:

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Friday he won't raise taxes to fix a budget
deficit estimated at more than $635 million because taxpayers already feel
"nickeled and dimed." Emanuel also promised not to fix the budget by cutting
police on the streets or by relying on one-time measures, such as raiding
reserve funds, something his predecessor, Mayor Richard Daley, did. Emanuel has
known since he took office in May that the city budget was in dire straits. He
will present his 2012 budget proposal to the city council in October.

Delta planes collide:

Two Delta planes collided while on the ground at O'Hare International Airport
Friday evening, said Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley.

No one was injured when Flight 2207 to Minneapolis and Flight 1777 to Atlanta
had a "taxiway incursion," Singley said.Officials cannot confirm what part of
the planes made contact, and the exact cause of the collision is still under
investigation, she said.Passengers on both aircraft were "deplaned," Singley
said.

Chicago Fire Department Chief Joe Roccaslava said the planes "clipped wings"
while backing out of the gates. Singley could not confirm that the contact was
wing to wing.

Insurance bill vetoed:

Gov. Pat Quinn has vetoed a bill that could've changed the way Illinois awards
health insurance contracts for state employees. Quinn said Friday that Senate
Bill 178 would have limited "transparency, competition and fairness" in the
state's procurement process. The bill would have given the Commission on
Government Forecasting and Accountability the authority to accept or reject
state health care contracts. The bipartisan commission is made up of state
legislators. Quinn says such authority lies with the executive branch alone. The
bill was introduced after a bidding process that replaced the state's longtime
insurance provider. That provider is now suing the state. State Rep. Naomi
Jakobsson, who sponsored the bill in the House, says the measure would've
extended the current contract for two years as the issue is resolved.

Rivers - Expections as Sekibo Challenges Amaechi

LENGTH: 1030  words


Governor Amaechi has also employed new teachers and re-trained the old ones.
Their welfare has already been taken over by the state government when it took
the responsibility of primary and junior secondary schools from the local
government councils. Distribution of the free textbooks, exercise books and
school uniforms launched by the governor on Independence Day has already
commenced.

In addition, the state government has also offered scholarship in tertiary
institutions in different parts of the world including Canada (297
scholarships), India (202), Ireland (30), Singapore (136) and United Kingdom
(384). There are also over 1,000 students studying abroad under the Rivers State
Sustainable Development Agency (RSSDA).

With the free education, it is believed that children in Rivers State would have
an edge over their peers in the academic sphere, particularly those children
from poor homes who ordinarily may not have had the opportunity of such
educational upbringing. Militancy, criminality and other vices would greatly
decline as more youths and children will get access to quality education and
turn out as better citizens.

In the health sector, many had been complaining that the state-owned hospitals
lacked adequate medical equipment; people were dying because healthcare
facilities were far away from them, particularly those in the coastal and rural
areas and the poor had no access to healthcare because of the high cost.
Maternal and child mortality was also high.

Now the government is offering free health services to all her citizenry in all
government owned hospitals or health centres. The idea is for primary healthcare
to reach everybody in the state, from those living in the urban areas to those
living in the rural villages and coastal areas. To achieve this, the state
government has constructed 160 health centres in all the local government areas.
It has also constructed a 1,000 bed specialist hospital with other special
intervention in this area.

The free healthcare is aimed at drastically reducing the mortality rate of
Rivers people, particularly maternal and infant mortality as the 160 primary
health centres built by the Amaechi administration are strategically sited to
serve every part of the state. People living in the villages and coastal areas
of the state would no longer cry about the distance they had to cover in search
of medical care, especially in emergency cases as the health centres have been
distributed according to demographic needs.For secondary health facilities,
Amaechi assured that before the end of the year, the Prof. Kelsey Harrison
Hospital, also known as the New Niger Hospital on Emenike Street and the Dental
and Maxillofacial Hospital at Garrison would be made functional. These are among
the four big hospitals built by the incumbent.

In spite of the good work Amaechi is doing in the state, a lot of people are
still not happy with him. Opposition has also come from within his party, the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). His political adversaries who almost thwarted
his governorship ambition in 2007 have never shied away from any plot to
undermine him.

After the emergence of Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo as the PDP National Chairman, some
party chieftains from the state but based in Abuja in a petition to Nwodo,
accused the governor of running a one man show in the state and sidelining other
stakeholders. To portray a seeming crisis, they established a parallel party
secretariat at No. 25 Ohaeto Street, in Port Harcourt.

Investigation revealed that the group had canvassed the dissolution of the
state's party executive under Godspower Ake. Their spokesperson, Jerry Needam
urged President Goodluck Jonathan and Nwodo to wade into the 'crisis' and bring
back all those who may have been alienated from the activities of the state
party.

He had said: "Given that the development threatens party foundation in the state
and the country at large, with regards to the 2011 elections, it is our candid
opinion that the party executives at the state and councils be dissolved to
create room for all genuine members to participate in party affairs and
contribute worthwhile ideas to its success in the expected elections and
subsequent others."

Recently, while Amaechi was on a visit to the United States of America to attend
a meeting on the Niger Delta, his political foes held a rally in Port Harcourt,
which was to portray him as an antagonist to President Jonathan. But to assure
President Jonathan of his support, Amaechi accompanied chiefs and elder citizens
of Rivers visited the president on the eve of his declaration and assured him
that the people of the state would stay with him in the 2011 presidential
election.

The spokesperson of the delegation, Senator Victor Odili, said, "today, we tell
you that the Governor, Government and the people of Rivers State are with
Jonathan. We will follow you with or without votes. You are our son who has
risen as a true Niger Delta son to confront the challenges of power, security,
fuel scarcity, and electoral reforms among others."

Odili berated those insinuating that the people and government were not standing
with the President and said "we are proud that your younger brother, Amaechi, is
working with you to make Nigeria better.

"Within a very short period, your younger brother, Amaechi has taken bold but
deliberate, calculated and determined steps to provide an enabling environment
for sustainable developments, good and transparent governance."

Another area where Governor Amaechi is facing some challenges since assumed
office as governor is daring to tell Rivers people: "that the era of fiscal
profligacy that characterised previous administrations was over." Under previous
administrations, resources meant for development were usually misapplied. But
when he came and put a stop to "free money", a lot of people were not happy with
him and they started plotting his downfall.

With the governor recently clinching the PDP ticket to fly the party's flag in
the April governorship elections in the state, the battle is not yet won. He
will have the likes of Abiye Sekibo to battle with in order to secure his return
to the seat of power in the state.

Del Sol changes help cut heart-attack death rates

BYLINE: By María Cortés González / El Paso Times

SECTION: HEALTH; Lifestyle

LENGTH: 781 words


Del Sol Medical Center has reduced the mortality rate of its heart-attack
patients after making changes to improve the quality of care during the past two
years.

"As we improved the care of heart-attack patients, we saw a significant decrease
in the mortality rate of those patients," said Jennifer Suitono, administrative
director for cardiovascular services at Del Sol.

Suitono said Del Sol implemented crucial steps as part of an initiative,
Expecting Success: Excellence in Cardiac Care, a $200,000 grant funded by the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It was one of 10 hospitals participating in the
study during 2005-07.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, the mortality rate for heart-attack patients who
died on arrival or during their stay was 13 percent. In the third quarter of
2007, the mortality rate had decreased significantly to 1.8 percent.

The Expecting Success: Excellence in Cardiac Care grant was initiated by the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation after a 2002 report from the Institute of
Medicine, "Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in
HealthCare," provided evidence that racial and ethnic disparities in care were
likely to occur in the treatment of cancer and heart disease, especially among
Hispanic patients.

"The whole purpose of this collaborative was to identify and hopefully eliminate
racial and ethnic disparities. And one of the reasons Del Sol was chosen to
participate is because of our geography and Hispanic population and the number
of cardiologists for the size of our population which is very few," Suitono
said.

Dr. Bruce Siegel, director of the Expecting Success program nationally and a
professor of health policy at George Washington University Medical School, said
Del Sol's numbers are impressive.

"Not all the hospitals improved," Siegel said, "so I'd say Del Sol was one of
the best and an example to the rest of the country."

Other participating hospitals were Delta Regional Medical Center (Greenville,
Miss.), Duke University Hospital (Durham, N.C.), Memorial Healthcare System
(Hollywood, Fla.), Monteflore Medical Center (New York City), Mount Sinai
Hospital Medical Center (Chicago), Sinai-Grace Hospital (Detroit), University
Health System (San Antonio), University of Mississippi Medical Center (Jackson,
Miss.) and Washington Hospital Center (Washington D.C.).

Siegel said it is evident the Del Sol unit pulled together as a team.

"They decided to take the issue head-on," he said. "And the physicians are
important, but I feel like the nurses were really empowered and feeling like
they had a role in it -- they are there 24/7."

Suitono said the changes started with having education, instructional and
discharge forms in Spanish.

"We found that though we had a large population that spoke Spanish, we didn't
have adequate instruction for our patients in Spanish," she said.

Other components added were providing aspirin within 24 hours, counseling for
smoking cessation and making sure doctors could prescribe medication easily at
the time of discharge.

Suitono added that a group of nurses was assigned to audit the patients' charts
and make sure they received the ideal care.

Micaela Gutierrez, a heart-failure nurse specialist, who monitors patients'
care, said she was surprised at first about the disparity in care.

"You would never think that the language would be a barrier. But part of the
problem in giving the instructions was that some of the family couldn't
understand or the other way around -- the patients couldn't understand," she
said.

Gutierrez said making sure patients understood the information and instructions
for medication reduced the possibility for patients being readmitted.

The detailed care and instructions led to much better results for patients who'd
had a heart attack.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, only 17 percent of patients received the full
range of recommended care by the American College of Cardiology and the American
Heart Association.

By the fourth quarter of 2007, 89 percent received all of the recommended care.

"And by the fourth quarter of 2008, we can tell you that 100 percent of patients
receive the recommended care," Suitono said.

Suitono said the hospital plans to continue looking at other areas of patient
care that can be improved.

"We're looking at how we can use the same tools for other areas such as surgical
care or pneumonia care so that we can provide the best care," she said.

On a national level, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation plans to publish the
heart-attack patient findings on the various hospitals and roll them into a
bigger project with more hospitals taking part in the next round.

Washington: EPA Offers Assistance to Help Rural Communities Revitalize Downtowns

LENGTH: 760  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued the following news
release:



 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today invited rural communities
to apply for planning assistance to develop strategies that help grow the
economy and revitalize downtown neighborhoods. EPA is offering this assistance
as part of Rural Advantage, a suite of federal economic development planning
assistance programs for rural communities.





 "Rural Advantage is helping communities reinvent themselves in ways that are
good for the economy and the environment," said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.
"We are excited to partner with communities that want to use their unique rural
assets to create a brighter, healthier future.



 Communities may apply for assistance through the following programs:



 o           Local Foods, Local Places (LFLP), which helps communities leverage
local food enterprise to diversify their economy and renew their downtowns.



 o           Cool & Connected, which helps communities use broadband service to
create walkable, connected, economically successful neighborhoods.



 o           Healthy Places for Healthy People, a new program that will help
communities partner with health care facilities to catalyze downtown
revitalization and to improve options for healthy living and economic
opportunity.



 Rural Advantage is part of the Obama Administration's commitment to place-based
strategies to help communities develop competitive advantages. In these places,
federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to
create customized solutions, bolstering coordination across agencies and
improving how we interact with and serve community partners.



 Under the Obama Administration, EPA and federal partners have provided rural
advantage assistance to 83 communities, to date.  Sixty-eight communities have
been selected for assistance through Local Foods, Local Places, and 15
communities have received assistance through Cool & Connected, ten of which are
in Appalachia.



 In 2012, Williamson, W Va., was selected to participate in the Livable
Communities in Appalachia program, the predecessor to LFLP. Through that effort,
a team of small-town development experts worked with Sustainable Williamson to
create an action plan tailored to achieving the town's goals, including
improving access to food to realize better health outcomes.



 Upon implementing the plan, Sustainable Williamson received an $80,000 planning
grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources
and Services Administration. That grant helped create a Federally Qualified
Health Center that later received an additional $650,000 to support clinic
operations. Sustainable Williamson also established a downtown farmers' market
and community garden that increased access to healthy foods for Williamson
residents. The Williamson Health and Wellness Center also received LFLP
assistance, in 2015, to provide support to new entrepreneurs starting up their
businesses in the local food and health care sectors, and to expand the
community's innovative approaches to creating a culture of health.



 In Montrose, Co., the Cool & Connected action plan helped advance Proximity
Space, an award-winning coworking project, and link it to the community's
efforts to build a walkable and investment-ready downtown. Coworking space
allows people to access high-speed internet, conference rooms, and office
equipment, and is one of many ways that small towns can leverage broadband to
boost main street development.



 Communities selected for this latest round of assistance will work with an
EPA-supported team of experts, including through a two-day workshop, to develop
strategies and action plans that enable them to realize their local
revitalization goals.  The team will include people with expertise in community
development, and representatives of the federal agencies that sponsor the three
programs so communities can build connections and take better advantage of
federal programs and resources.



 Working with federal partners, EPA will select thirty or more communities for
assistance through a competitive process.



 EPA's Rural Advantage federal partners are the United States Departments of
Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and
Transportation, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional
Authority and the Economic Development Administration.

Community Dental Care gets another big grant

BYLINE: Brett Boese, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 440 words


Dec. 02--Good news continues to roll in for Community Dental Care's expansion
plans in Rochester.

Weeks after receiving a $1 million grant to help fund a new 18-chair office in
Southeast Rochester, Community Dental Care received another grant for $450,000
top help complete the $3.9 million project. The first grant came from Delta
Dental of Minnesota Foundation and the latest one, announced Tuesday, came from
the Otto Bremer Trust.

Local leaders held a ceremonial groundbreaking for Community Dental's new
facility in September. The first 9 chairs are expected to be operational in
September 2017, providing a critical service to low-income families, minorities
and children.

"Community Dental Care is responding to an urgent need for oral health care in
Rochester and surrounding communities," Otto Bremer Trust CEO and trustee Daniel
Reardon said via statement. "We are very excited to move this important work
forward."

Community Dental has been operating a six-chair clinic in the Heintz Center on
RCTC's campus since 2012, but that site has been overwhelmed while trying to
meet the needs of local residents. It has a two-month waiting list for dental
appointments and a seven-month waiting list to see a hygienist.

According to data provided by Community Dental Care, around 70 percent of the
71,000 residents in and around Olmsted County eligible for public programs did
not receive care. Just 43 percent of the 10,000 Medicaid-eligible children
visited a dentist.

The new facility is expected to create up to 35 full-time jobs while providing
primary dental care to about 10,000 people annually. The targeted audience is
low-income families and those living in poverty, who might otherwise not be able
to afford dental care. Programming at the clinic will include preventative
education for families.

The City of Rochester previously approved a $2.25 million loan to support
Community Dental's expansion plans located along U.S. Highway 14 near RCTC. The
new site is located on a public transportation route to allow for easy access.

"The need for dental services in Rochester and our surrounding communities is
enormous," said Dr. Vacharee Peterson, CEO of Community Dental Care. "Too many
people are going without even a simple exam, which can prevent the need for
serious or emergency dental procedures in the future. This new clinic will
transform dental care access for thousands of these children and families in
need.
