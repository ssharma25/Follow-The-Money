OPINION


MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

THIS MATTER comes before the Court on Defendants Arsenio Trujillo and Elisa
Trujillo's Motion to Quash the Preliminary Injunction Or, Alternatively, for
Three Judge Court, Doc. 9906, filed November 1, 2014. For the reasons stated
below, the Court DENIES the Motion.

On January 13, 1983, the Court, after having heard oral argument, granted a
motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered that:


     no permits to appropriate underground waters shall be issued within
     the Rio Pojoaque stream system under Section 72-12-1, N.M.S.A. 1978.
     Permits may issue limited to the use of water for household, drinking
     and sanitary purposes within a closed water system that returns
     effluent below the surface of the ground minimizing and [sic]
     consumptive use of water. All subject to further order of the court.


(Doc. No. 641) (Mechem, S.J.) ("preliminary injunction").

The Trujillos move the Court to quash the preliminary injunction for want of
jurisdiction. They argue that [*53]  the "preliminary injunction violates 28 USC
§ 2283." Motion at 5. They also argue that Senior U.S. District Judge Edwin L.
Mechem "failed to convene a three judge court to review the actions of the Court
after granting the motion [for a preliminary injunction] as required [by 28
U.S.C. § 2284]." Motion at 5.

The Trujillos' arguments are completely without merit because neither of the
statutes on which they rely are applicable to this case. The statute governing
the stay of State court proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, states:


     A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay
     proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of
     Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect
     or effectuate its judgments.


The preliminary injunction enjoins the State Engineer from issuing domestic well
permits which allow use of domestic well water for outdoor irrigation. The
preliminary injunction does not "stay proceedings in a State court." The statute
concerning three judge district courts, 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a), states in part:

     A district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise
     required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging
     the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional [*54]
     districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.


The Trujillos have not cited any Act of Congress which requires a district court
of three judges for this water rights adjudication or to issue the preliminary
injunction. This water rights adjudication does not challenge the
constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the
apportionment of any statewide legislative body.

Regarding the Trujillos' assertion that the "preliminary injunction is null and
void for want of jurisdiction," the Court has previously determined, on more
than one occasion, that it has subject matter jurisdiction because the United
States is a plaintiff in this case:


     The Court has subject matter jurisdiction because the United States is
     a plaintiff in this case. "28 U.S.C. § 1345 grants broad
     jurisdictional power to the district courts over suits when the United
     States is plaintiff." U.S. v. Lahey Clinic Hospital, Inc., 399 F.3d 1,
     9 (1st Cir. 2005). The statute provides: "Except as otherwise provided
     by Act of Congress, the district courts shall have original
     jurisdiction of all civil actions, suits, or proceedings commenced by
     the United States or by any agency or officer thereof expressly
     authorized to sue by Act of Congress." 28 U.S.C. § 1345. "Section 1345
     creates subject matter [*55]  jurisdiction." U.S. v. Lahey Clinic
     Hospital, Inc., 399 F.3d at 9.


Mem. Op. and Order at 11, Doc. 7579, filed March 30, 2012 (Vázquez, J.); see
also Mem. Op. and Order at 5, Doc. 7757, filed September 20, 2012 (Vázquez, J.)
(same).

The Court denies the Motion to Quash the Preliminary Injunction Or,
Alternatively, for Three Judge Court, because the arguments are clearly without
merit and raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction which the Court has
previously decided.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Defendants Trujillos' Motion to Quash the
Preliminary Injunction Or, Alternatively, for Three Judge Court, Doc. 9906,
filed November 1, 2014, is DENIED.

Washington: Obama Administration Announces Competition to Designate the Third
and Final Round of Promise Zones

LENGTH: 978  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



 Today, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián
Castro and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack announced
that communities may now apply to be designated a Promise Zone under the third
and final round competition. Read the new notice seeking Promise Zone
applications.





 Promise Zones are high-poverty communities where the federal government
partners with local leaders to increase economic activity, improve educational
opportunities, leverage private investment, reduce violent crime, enhance public
health and address other priorities identified by the community. Through the
Promise Zone designation, communities will work directly with federal, state and
local agencies to give local leaders proven tools to improve the quality of life
in some of the country's most vulnerable areas. Read more about the Promise
Zones InitiativeThis is an external link or third-party site outside of the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website..



 "Promise Zones are transforming communities through targeted investments and
the breaking down of government siloes to make a real difference in people's
lives," said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. "We believe where you live shouldn't
determine what you can achieve. This initiative will be part of the lasting
legacy from the Obama Administration and we look forward to witnessing these
neighborhoods of opportunity grow in the years and decades ahead."



 "This initiative is bringing much-needed, targeted investments and creating
ladders of economic opportunity in impoverished rural and tribal areas that have
the greatest needs," said USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack. "The success of our work
in these Promise Zones is predicated upon public-private partnerships that will
lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for children and families in
rural areas."



 Any community meeting the eligibility criteria which includes having a
contiguous boundary, a high poverty rate and a population within the area not
exceeding 200,000 residents, can apply for a designation. HUD and USDA will
designate 7 Promise Zones across urban, rural and tribal communities for the
final round. The deadline for submitting Promise Zone applications is Tuesday,
February 23, 2016 at 5:00PM Eastern Time. Announcements will be made in the
Spring of 2016.



 Each urban, rural, and tribal Promise Zone applicant will be asked to put
together a clear description of how the Promise Zone designation would
accelerate and strengthen the community's own efforts at comprehensive community
revitalization. Once designated, each Promise Zone will be coordinated by a lead
community based organization in partnership with the Obama Administration. HUD
will be the federal lead for the urban designees, while USDA will serve as the
lead federal partner to the tribal and rural Promise Zones.



 All Promise Zones will receive priority access to federal investments that
further their strategic plans, federal staff on the ground to help them
implement their goals, and five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to recruit
and manage volunteers and strengthen the capacity of the Promise Zone
initiatives.



 Communities with an existing Promise Zone designation are: San Antonio, TXThis

and tribal communities in January and February. The schedule for the webcasts is

OPINION


 [*1177]  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER APPROVING [**52]  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

THIS MATTER comes before the Court on approximately 800 Objections to the
Settlement Agreement and Proposed Partial Final Judgment and Decree on the Water
Rights of the Pueblos of Tesuque, Pojoaque, Nambé and San Ildefonso, and Interim
Administrative Order. See Doc's 8094 - 9877. For the reasons stated below, the
Court will OVERRULE all of the Objections, APPROVE the Settlement Agreement,
Doc. 7970-1, ENTER the proposed Partial Final Judgment and Decree of the Water
Rights of the Pueblos of Nambé, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque, Doc.
7970-3, and ENTER the proposed Interim Administrative Order, Doc. 7970-2.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Settlement negotiations regarding the water rights of the Pueblos began in 2000
and resulted with a completed Settlement Agreement in 2006. On December 18,
2007, the Court entered an order establishing the procedure for approval of the
Settlement Agreement. See Doc. 6282; amended by Doc. 7310, filed February 9,
2011. Both the initial and the amended procedural orders provided that after
notification of federal approval of the Settlement Agreement, or notification of
completion of the process to address any required modifications of the [**53]
Settlement Agreement, the Court would enter an order to show cause why the Court
should not approve the Settlement Agreement. The Court entered its Second
Amended Procedural Order which shortened deadlines and approved the proposed
Objection form. See Doc. 7988, filed November 4, 2013. The Objection form
instructs objectors to "state the specific legal and factual basis for your
objection," and to "state how your water rights will be injured or harmed in a
legally cognizable way by the Settlement Agreement and entry of the proposed
decree and interim order." Doc. 7971-3 at 2, filed October 3, 2013.

On December 8, 2010, the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act was enacted. Pub. L.
No. 111-291 §§ 601 et seq., 124 Stat. 3134. The Settlement Act authorizes the
Settlement Agreement on the condition that the Court approves a partial final
decree that sets forth the water rights and other rights to water to which the
Pueblos are entitled under the Settlement Agreement and a final decree that sets
forth the water rights for all parties to this case by September 15, 2017.
Settlement Act §§ 621(a) and 623(a)(2)(G) and (H). If the final decrees are not
approved by September 15, 2017, the Settlement Agreement will no longer be
effective and any unexpended federal [**54]  funds appropriated to carry out the
activities authorized by the Act will be returned to the federal government.
Settlement Act §§ 623(b)(1) and (3). The Settlement Act also authorizes the
design and construction of a Regional Water System to distribute water to the
Pueblos and the Santa Fe County Water Utility. Settlement Act § 611(a).

During 2011 and 2012, the Settlement Parties revised the Settlement Agreement to
conform to the provisions in the Settlement Act. In October, 2013, the State of
New Mexico certified to the Court that modifications to the Settlement Agreement
necessary to conform it to the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act have been
completed and that the conformed Settlement Agreement has been executed by the
Settlement Parties. See Doc. 7970. Copies of  [*1178]  the proposed Interim
Administrative Order and the proposed Partial Final Judgment and Decree were
attached to the Certification.

On December 6, 2013, the Court entered an Order to Show Cause why the Court
should not approve the Settlement Agreement. See Doc. 8035. The Order to Show
Cause provided summaries of the Settlement Agreement, the Interim Administrative
Order and the proposed Partial Final Decree, and gave notice where complete
copies [**55]  of the Settlement Agreement, the Interim Administrative Order and
the proposed Partial Final Decree may be reviewed. The deadline for objections
was April 7, 2014.

Approximately 800 Objections have been filed. Pursuant to the Court's Case
Management Order, Doc. 9506, several Settlement Parties filed memoranda
summarizing the 800 Objections and stating arguments in support of the position
that the Court should approve the Settlement Agreement and enter the Partial
Final Decree at this time. See Doc's 9910 (United States and Pueblos of Nambé,
Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque), 9911 (Rio de Tesuque Association, Inc.),
9912 (Members of the Rio Pojoaque Acequia and Water Well Association, Inc.) and
9913 (State of New Mexico, Santa Fe County and City of Santa Fe). Of the 800
Objections, three groups filed responses in opposition to the memoranda in
support of approval of the Settlement agreement. See Doc's 9957 (Paul White),
9972 (the Dunn Group) and 9973 (the Atencio Group).1 The Settlement Parties that
filed the four memoranda in support also filed reply briefs. See Doc's 10009
(Rio de Tesuque Association, Inc.), 10010 (Members of the Rio Pojoaque Acequia
and Water Well Association, Inc.), [**56]  10011 (United States and Pueblos of
Nambé, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque), and 10012 State of New Mexico,
Santa Fe County and City of Santa Fe). The Court has reviewed the Objections as
well as the pleadings in support of and in opposition to the Court approving the
Settlement Agreement and entering the Partial Final Decree.

STANDARD OF REVIEW

In its Order granting the motion of the Settlement Parties to establish
procedures for approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Court ordered:


     The burden shall be on the objecting party to demonstrate that the
     rights proposed to be settled pursuant to the Settlement Agreement
     should not be quantified and administered as proposed in the
     Settlement Agreement. Objections shall be required to demonstrate that
     adoption and implementation of the Settlement Agreement is not fair,
     adequate, reasonable, is not in the public interest, or is not
     consistent with applicable law. Objections must include the following:
     (1) name and address of objector; (2) description of water rights
     claimed by objector; (3) statement [**57]  of the specific legal and
     factual basis of the objection; and (4) how the objector will be
     injured or harmed by the Settlement Agreement in a legally cognizable
     way.


Doc. 6282 at 4-5.
     In exercising its discretion, the trial court must approve a
     settlement if it is fair, reasonable and adequate. In assessing
     whether the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate the trial
     court should consider:


          (1) whether the proposed settlement was fairly and honestly
          negotiated;

          [*1179]  (2) whether serious questions of law and fact
          exist, placing the ultimate outcome of the litigation in
          doubt;

          (3) whether the value of an immediate recovery outweighs the
          mere possibility of future relief after protracted and
          expensive litigation; and

          (4) the judgment of the parties that the settlement is fair
          and reasonable.





Jones v. Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc., 741 F.2d 322, 324 (10th Cir. 1984).

DISCUSSION

The Objections can be generally characterized as: (i) complaints about the
procedure for the approval of the Settlement Agreement; (ii) concerns about the
implementation of the Settlement Agreement; and (iii) disagreements about the
application of state and federal laws.

Settlement Agreement Approval Procedure

Many of the Parties objected to the Settlement Agreement approval procedure
asserting: (i) [**58]  they were excluded from the Settlement negotiations; (ii)
the Executive Branch of the State of New Mexico did not have authority to
settle; (iii) service of the Order to Show Cause was not proper; and (iv) there
was insufficient time and information to assess the Settlement and file
objections.

Excluded from Participation in Settlement Negotiations

Some Objectors complain that they were excluded from the settlement negotiations
and that information regarding the settlement negotiations was kept
confidential. See Doc. 8424 at 8. The Court has previously addressed this issue
stating:


     In litigation involving numerous parties, litigants sometimes seek a
     settlement with less than all of the parties. Federal Judicial Center,
     Manual for Complex Litigation 174 (4th ed. 2004). In this
     adjudication, where there are hundreds of claimants, it is extremely
     unlikely that settlement negotiations involving every party in this
     case would resolve successfully in a reasonable period of time. There
     is nothing impermissible or improper about the Settlement Parties
     attempting to settle their disputes among themselves and allowing
     other parties to join in the settlement later.

     . . . .

     The negotiations were closed [**59]  to the public because the Court
     ordered that all oral and written statements made in the course of
     discussions with the mediator be kept confidential. (Order, Doc. No.
     5629, filed September 15, 2000). The purpose of the confidentiality
     rule is to encourage the parties to be candid with the mediator by
     making them comfortable that their positions, willingness to settle,
     weaknesses of their case, etc. will not prematurely influence the
     trial judge. Both the United States Congress and the Court of Appeals
     for the Tenth Circuit, in which this Court sits, recognize that the
     guarantee of confidentiality is essential to the proper functioning of
     a settlement program. See Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 28
     U.S.C. § 652(d) (each district court shall, by local rule, provide for
     the confidentiality of the mediation process and prohibit disclosure
     of confidential mediation communications); Clark v. Stapleton Corp.,
     957 F.2d 745, 746 (10th Cir. 1992) (for settlement program to be
     successful, participants must trust that matters discussed at a
     settlement conference will not be revealed to the judge).


Doc. 6236, 582 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1319.

Authority of Executive Branch to Settle

Some Objectors contend that "only the New Mexico legislature has authority to
bind the State into compacts and agreements," [**60]  and that the "New Mexico
Executive branch Officers who signed the  [*1180]  proposed Settlement Agreement
lacked authority to authorize it." Dunn Response at 20-26.

The Court has previously overruled such an objection in the Taos Adjudication
after concluding that those objectors ignored New Mexico law, specifically the
statute governing compromise, satisfaction or release by the attorney general or
district attorney:


     The attorney general and district attorneys of this state in their
     respective districts, when any civil proceedings may be pending in
     their respective districts, in the district court, in which the state
     or any county may be a party, whether the same be an ordinary suit,
     scire facias proceedings, proceedings growing out of any criminal
     prosecution, or otherwise, shall have power to compromise or settle
     said suit or proceedings, or grant a release or enter satisfaction in
     whole or in part, of any claim or judgment in the name of the state or
     county, or dismiss the same, or take any other steps or proceedings
     therein which to him may appear proper and right; and all such civil
     suits and proceedings shall be entirely under the management and
     control of the said attorney general or district [**61]  attorneys,
     and all compromises, releases and satisfactions heretofore made or
     entered into by said officers are hereby confirmed and ratified.

     N.M. Stat. Ann. § 36-1-22 (1978) (emphasis added).


Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 5958, filed July 30, 2015, in New Mexico v. Abeyta, No.
69cv7896, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177504, at *13 (D.N.M.) (Vázquez, J.).

Service of the Order to Show Cause

Some Objectors complain that the Order to Show Cause was served by first class
mail, instead of by certified mail as required by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. The Objectors assert that because there is no proof that
Defendants received the Order to Show Cause and if there are errors in the
addresses in the State's mailing list, there is potential for future litigation
by those Defendants who did not receive the Order to Show Cause, thereby
jeopardizing the status of all subfile orders.

The Court overrules this objection for the following reasons. Rule 4 applies to
service of summons and is not applicable to the service of the Order to Show
Cause. Rule 5, which governs service of pleadings and other papers, provides
that a "paper is served under this rule by . . . mailing it to the person's last
known address--in which event service is complete upon mailing." Fed. R. Civ. P.
5(b)(2)(C). The Court ordered the State to update its service [**62]  list of
known claimants and to mail the Order to Show Cause to those claimants. See
Procedural Order at 2-3, Doc. 6282. With regard to unknown claimants and known
claimants whose addresses were not on the updated service list, the Court
ordered the State to publish the Order to Show Cause in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Pojoaque Basin and in the City and County of Santa Fe once a
week for four weeks, to post an electronic version of the Order to Show Cause on
the Office of the State Engineer's website, and to post the Order to Show Cause
at the Office of the State Engineer in Santa Fe, the County of Santa Fe's
Pojoaque Satellite Office, and at the Joe M. Stell Ombusman Program at the Utton
Center at the University of New Mexico. See Amended Procedural Order at 3-4,
Doc. 7310. The publication and posting of the Order to Show Cause served "as
notification to those water rights claimants who were not known with reasonable
diligence to the Settling Parties and claimants whose addresses are not on the
updated service list." Doc. 7310 at 10; see also Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank
and Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 316, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950) (The
Supreme  [*1181]  Court of the United States "has not hesitated to approve of
resort to publication as a customary substitute in another [**63]  class of
cases where it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate
warning. Thus it has been recognized that, in the case of persons missing or
unknown, employment of an indirect and even a probably futile means of
notification is all that the situation permits and creates no constitutional bar
to a final decree foreclosing their rights").

Insufficient Time and Information to Decide about Settlement Agreement

Some Objectors assert that they did not have sufficient time to review the "very
complex 49 page settlement agreement, the order to show cause, the partial final
decree, the summary, the interim administrative order and the correspondence
from the State Engineer." The approximately 800 Objections that raise the
numerous issues addressed in this Order indicate that the 60-day period for
filing objections provided sufficient time to review the Settlement Agreement.

The Objectors also assert that they cannot properly assess the Settlement
Agreement because several documents referenced in the Settlement Agreement, i.e.
the Joint Powers Agreement, the Water Master Rules, the Operating Agreement, and
the Environmental Impact Statement, are not complete. The Court has [**64]
previously denied a request to stay the Settlement Agreement approval process
until those documents are completed because the parties requesting the stay did
not show how the requested documents are relevant to determining whether the
Settlement Agreement is fair, adequate, reasonable, in the public interest or
consistent with applicable law. See Magistrate Judge William P. Lynch's Order,
Doc. 9473 (denying motion for stay); Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 9674 (overruling
objections to Magistrate Judge's Order denying motion for stay) (Johnson, J.).
The Objections now before the Court similarly fail to show that those documents
are necessary for determining whether the Settlement Agreement is fair,
adequate, reasonable, in the public interest or consistent with applicable law.

Implementation of the Settlement Agreement

Some Objectors expressed concerns about the fairness of the implementation of
the Settlement Agreement alleging that the State Engineer has a conflict of
interest, there is unequal representation on the Water Authority Board, and
non-Indians do not have the right to enforce the Settlement Agreement. Others
express concerns about their ability to afford the cost to connect to [**65]
the Regional Water System, and the amount and quality of the water available for
their use.

Conflict of Interest

Some claimants assert that there appears to be a conflict of interest in the
terms of the Settlement Agreement relating to the role of the State Engineer,
noting that Section 5.2.1.1 provides the State Engineer with the right to
restrict Pueblo water rights, Section 5.2.1.2 provides that a Water Master has
the same authority over non-Indian water rights, while Section 5.2 designates
the State Engineer as the Water Master. Those claimants do not explain how the
State Engineer's duty to administer Pueblos' water rights will conflict with his
duty to administer the water rights of the non-Indians, and vice versa.

Unequal Representation on Board

Some claimants object to the proposed representation on the Water Authority
Board of four tribal representatives and one county representative as unfair,
and suggest that the Board "should reflect  [*1182]  the interest of the parties
involved approx. 6000 non-tribal and 1000 tribal individuals."

The Court finds that the proposed representation of one representative for each
of the five governmental entities that will be served by the Water Authority is
not unfair. The Regional Water Authority [**66]  will be established by the
County and the Pueblos "to operate and maintain the diversion and treatment
facilities, certain transmission pipelines and other facilities of the Regional
Water System" consistent with the Settlement Agreement "for the purpose of
ensuring a reliable firm supply of water to all users of the Regional Water
System." Settlement Agreement Sections 1.6.30, 9.5 and 9.6.1. One representative
for each of the five governmental entities is appropriate because those entities
are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the regional water system
infrastructure, and are not determining the allocation of water between the
Pueblos and the County users of the system. The Pueblos and County are required
to submit an Operating Agreement with provisions to ensure that the operation
and maintenance of the system is in accordance with the Settlement Agreement;
there must also be provisions for dispute resolution. See Settlement Act §612.
Furthermore, the claimants do not demonstrate how any alleged unequal
representation will harm them if they choose to not join the settlement.

Non-Indian Enforcement

Some Objectors "object to the lack of right to enforce the settlement agreement
by non-Indians."

[**67] The Settlement Agreement will be enforced. Under Section 5.2 of the
Settlement Agreement, the State Engineer "agrees to perform the function of
Water Master" which includes "the authority to curtail Pueblo surface and
groundwater diversion in order to ensure compliance with the terms of, and the
delivery of water in accordance with, this Agreement, the Interim Administrative
Order, and the Final Decree." In addition, Section 1.5 of the Settlement
Agreement provides that "the Decree Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction
to interpret and enforce the terms, provisions, and conditions of the Agreement,
the Interim Administrative Order, and the Final Decree." "'Decree Court' means
the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico." Settlement
Agreement Section 1.6.12. Thus, this Court, the United States District Court for
the District of New Mexico, will retain continuing jurisdiction to enforce the
provisions of the Settlement Agreement, the Interim Administrative Order and the
Final Decree.

Personal Financial Condition/Water System Availability

Some Objectors expressed concerns about being able to afford the cost to connect
to the County Water Utility ("CWU") and the cost of the water, or that the water
system will not extend to their property.

Section 3.1.7.1 of the Settlement Agreement states: "a Settlement Party who is
an owner of a water right from a well shall not be required to connect to the
CWU water system and shall not be required to cease use of the well." Doc.
7970-1 at 25. Furthermore, no person that elects "to connect to the CWU under
Section 3.1.7.2.1 shall be required to cease use of such well and connect to the
CWU unless all connection expenses are paid by the Pojoaque Valley Water Utility
Connection Fund or other third party." Doc. 7970-1 at 27. Section 3.1.7.2.1 also
provides that those persons electing to connect to the County Water Utility
"shall be permitted to continue to use [their] well . . . until they are able to
connect [**68]  to the [County Water Utility] and obtain service." Thus,
[*1183]  there is no merit to the contention that some Objectors cannot afford
the cost of connecting to the CWU.

Water Quantity Insufficient/Outdoor Use Restriction

Some claimants object to the "restriction against outdoor use of a domestic well
for irrigation" and state that limitations on the quantity of water they are
allowed to use will be insufficient to meet their needs.

The Settlement Agreement will not affect the amount of water use for those
claimants that choose to not join the Settlement. For claimants who do not join
the Settlement, the amount of their water rights will be determined based on
historical beneficial use and the terms of their permit.

Water Quality

Some Objectors are concerned that the treated Rio Grande water provided by the
CWU would not be the same quality of their well water.

Section 3.1.7.1 of the Settlement Agreement states: "a Settlement Party who is
an owner of a water right from a well shall not be required to connect to the
[County Water Utility] water system and shall not be required to cease use of
the well." Doc. 7970-1 at 25. In addition, "water supplied by the [County Water
Utility] must meet federal and state regulatory [**69]  standards for drinking
water quality." State Parties' Joint Memorandum at 64.

Transfer of Water Rights before Regional Water System Complete

Some claimants object to the transfer of their water rights to the CWU upon
entry of the Partial Final Decree and before the Regional Water System is
completed.

The Settlement Agreement does not require any party to transfer their domestic
well water rights to the CWU unless they choose to connect to the CWU; those
rights are transferred upon connection to the CWU, not upon entry of the Final
Partial Decree. See Section 3.1.7.2.1 of the Settlement Agreement; Section
3.1.7.1 ("a Settlement Party who is an owner of a water right from a well shall
not be required to cease use of the well.").2 The Settlement Agreement does not
require parties who do not join the Settlement to transfer their water rights to
the CWU.

which case diversions from the new point of diversion must cease and shall be

Settlement Agreement §§ 3.1.4.1 and 3.1.7.1.

Taking

Some Objectors contend that "[b]y the terms of the settlement agreement (See
Section 3), the beneficial use of 3.0 AFY of groundwater [**70]  granted by
permits issued after 1956 by the New Mexico State Engineer, are reduced to 0.5
AFY without just compensation, arbitrarily and in violation of the Domestic Well
Statute."

Those Objectors misread Section 3 of the Settlement Agreement which governs
Non-Pueblo Water Rights and states:


     The quantity of the right for each [domestic] well . . . shall be
     limited to the historic beneficial use from such well, provided,
     however, that in no event shall the total diversion from any such well
     exceed 3 AFY, and provided further that the State agrees, and the
     Settlement Parties will not oppose, to move the Court to presume that
     historic beneficial use from a well is .5 AFY per household, unless a
     greater historic beneficial use is shown or unless a more restrictive
     diversion limit applies pursuant to court order, covenant or
     ordinance.


Settlement Agreement §3.1.2.2 (emphasis added). The Court has previously
addressed  [*1184]  the issue of whether water rights for domestic wells in New
Mexico are limited to the quantity of water beneficially used, as opposed to the
permit amount of three acre-feet per year:

In the Zuni River Basin Adjudication the Court stated:





          New Mexico law is clear on the subject. The constitutional
          [**71]  provision and statutes . . . as well as abundant
          case law clearly state that beneficial use defines the
          extent of a water right. This fundamental principle is
          applicable to all appropriations of public waters. Only by
          applying water to beneficial use can an appropriator acquire
          a perfected right to that water.


     United States v. A & R Productions, No. 01cv72, Doc. No. 733, 2006
     U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102099, at *9, filed June 15, 2006 (D.N.M.) (Black,
     J.) (citations and quotation marks omitted).


State of New Mexico v. Aamodt, No. Civ. 66-6639 MV/WPL, Doc. 7757, 2012 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 191224, at *33, filed September 20, 2012 (D.N.M.) (Vázquez, J.).

Shared Wells

Some Objectors assert that the Settlement Agreement does not address shared
wells. Section 3.1.2.2 states that the:


     quantity of the right for each Section 72-12-1 [Domestic Well Statute]
     well, including all wells subject to the Post-1982 Well Agreement,
     shall be limited to historic beneficial use from such well, provided,
     however, that in no event shall the total diversion from such well
     exceed 3 AFY, and provided further that the State agrees, and the
     Settlement Parties will not oppose, to move the Court to presume that
     historic beneficial use from a well is .5 AFY per household . . . .


Doc. 7970-1 at 22 (emphasis added). The "per [**72]  household" language
indicates that the Settlement Agreement addresses both single-user wells and
shared wells.

Application of State and Federal Law

The final general category of objections relates to whether implementation of
the Settlement Agreement will violate state or federal laws.

McCarran Amendment

Some claimants assert that "the application of different water laws to the
Pueblos and the non-Indians" and "the use of the federal reserve doctrine to
determine the Pueblo's water rights" are violations of the McCarran Amendment.

The McCarran Amendment, which provides for the joinder of the United States as a
defendant in water rights adjudications states:


     Consent is given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit
     (1) for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river
     system or other source, or (2) for the administration of such rights,
     where it appears that the United States is the owner of or is in the
     process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under State law, by
     purchase, by exchange, or otherwise, and the United States is a
     necessary party to such suit. The United States, when a party to any
     such suit, shall (1) be deemed to have waived any right to plead that
     the State laws are inapplicable or that the United [**73]  States is
     not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty, and (2) shall be
     subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having
     jurisdiction, and may obtain review thereof, in the same manner and to
     the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances:
     Provided, That no judgment for costs shall be entered against the
     United States in any such suit.


43 U.S.C. § 666(a). Except for stating that the United States is deemed to have
waived any right to plead that State laws  [*1185]  are inapplicable, the
McCarran Amendment does not address which laws are applicable to the
determination of Pueblo water rights.

Equal Protection

Some claimants object stating that the Settlement Agreement "violates the Equal
Rights and Protection Clause of the Constitution [because] it allows one group
of people rights and protection that are denied to another group of people."

The Equal Protection Clause "is essentially a direction that all persons
similarly situated should be treated alike." City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living
Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). The two
groups the Objectors refer to, the individual non-Indian claimants and the four
Pueblos, are not similarly situated. Unlike the individual non-Indian claimants,
the Pueblos are federally recognized Indian tribes, with the United States as
their guardian and trustee. "The United States has not relinquished [**74]
jurisdiction and control over the Pueblos and has not placed their water rights
under New Mexico law." New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d 1102, 1111 (10th Cir.
1976).

Forfeiture/ Pueblo Uses of Water

Some Objectors object to "the double standard of treatment for the Non-Indians
and the Pueblos as proposed by the settlement agreement" noting that "the
Pueblos' water rights are protected from forfeiture but not the non-Indians'
rights." Other Objectors argue that "the State Engineer is required to
adjudicate water rights based on specific criteria and existing law," that "the
law in New Mexico is that beneficial water rights existing and used prior to
1907, have been confirmed," and that the "Settlement Agreement seeks to modify
this legal standard and provide water rights to the Pueblos that were not
established by beneficial use prior to 1907." Dunn Response at 27-28. Some
Objectors complain that the Settlement Agreement is unfair because "Non-Pueblo
water-right owner Parties are required to show historic beneficial use of their
water right . . . [while] the Pueblo Parties have no requirement to demonstrate
historic beneficial use. Those Parties are simply allocated a water right to
support desired use, including such non-historic uses as golf [**75]  courses."

These Objections fail to recognize the applicable laws. "The rights of the
non-Indians are subject to the water laws of New Mexico. The water rights of the
Pueblos are not subject to the laws of New Mexico because the United States has
never surrendered its jurisdiction and control." New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d
1102, 1112 (10th Cir. 1976). The Settlement Agreement does not govern forfeiture
of water rights. Forfeiture of water rights for non-Indians is governed by State
statute. See N.M.S.A § 72-5-28, Failure to use water; forfeiture.

Domestic Well Statute Violation

Some Objectors contend that the Settlement Agreement violates the New Mexico
Domestic Well Statute because the Agreement denies domestic well owners
protections from priority calls.

Neither the current domestic well statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. § 72-12-1.1, which
states:


     A person, firm or corporation desiring to use public underground
     waters described in this section for irrigation of not to exceed one
     acre of noncommercial trees, lawn or garden or for household or other
     domestic use shall make application to the state engineer for a well
     on a form to be prescribed by the state engineer. Upon the filing of
     each application describing the use applied for, the state engineer
     shall issue a permit to the applicant to use [**76]  the underground
     waters applied for; provided that permits for domestic water use
     within municipalities  [*1186]  shall be conditioned to require the
     permittee to comply with all applicable municipal ordinances enacted
     pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 53 NMSA 1978.


nor its predecessor statute, N.M. Stat. Ann. § 72-12-1, which states in relevant
part:
     Any person, firm or corporation desiring to use any of the waters
     described in this act for watering livestock, for irrigation of not to
     exceed one acre of noncommercial trees, lawn, or garden; or for
     household or other domestic use shall make application or applications
     from time to time to the state engineer on a form to be prescribed by
     him. Upon the filing of each such application, describing the use
     applied for, the state engineer shall issue a permit to the applicant
     to so use the waters applied for.


provide any protection from priority calls. The New Mexico Supreme Court
recently stated: "Nothing in the language of the [Domestic Well Statute]
prevents domestic well permits from being administered in the same way as all
other water rights, including priority administration--exactly what Article XVI,
Section 2 of the New Mexico Constitution requires." Bounds v. State ex rel.
D'Antonio, 2013-NMSC-037 ¶28, 306 P.3d 457.

Authority to Close Basin to New Domestic Well Permits

Some Objectors claim [**77]  that the State Engineer "is without jurisdiction to
unilaterally and arbitrarily close the [Nambe-Tesuque-Pojoaque] aquifer to
further development." Section 5.1.1 of the Settlement Agreement states: "The
Pojoaque Basin is fully appropriated and there shall be no new appropriations in
the basin after the Enforcement Date of this Agreement." Doc. 7970-1 at 37.

The State Engineer has the authority to close the basin to further development
and to limit the issuance of domestic well permits. See Lion's Gate Water v.
D'Antonio, 2009-NMSC-057, ¶ 24, 147 N.M. 523, 226 P.3d 622 (the New Mexico
legislature has granted the State Engineer broad powers to implement and enforce
the water laws administered by him); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 72-2-8(A) ("The state
engineer may adopt regulations and codes to implement and enforce any provision
of any law administered by him and may issue orders necessary to implement his
decisions and to aid him in the accomplishment of his duties. In order to
accomplish its purpose, this provision is to be liberally construed."); N.M.
Stat. Ann. § 72-2-8(H) ("Any regulation, code or order issued by the state
engineer is presumed to be in proper implementation of the provisions of the
water laws administered by him."); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 72-5-7 ("If, in the opinion
of the state engineer, there is no unappropriated water available, he shall
reject [**78]  such application."); City of Albuquerque v. Reynolds, 1962- NMSC
173, 71 N.M. 428, 379 P.2d 73, (1962) ("The jurisdiction and duties of the state
engineer with reference to streams and underground waters are the same").

Violates State Law by Changing Priorities

Some Objectors argue that the Settlement Agreement "violates current State water
law, by changing the priority rights of water right holders that are junior to
the Pueblos . . . . [by] creating a new system that effectively punishes
objecting water rights owners for failing to agree to settlement by forcing them
to bear curtailment of future priority calls by the Pueblos while rights that
are junior are excepted." Dunn Response at 9. These Objectors argue that the
Settlement Agreement effectively changes priority dates because it provides
protection from priority enforcement for junior non-Pueblo rights for those
claimants who join the Settlement, while leaving senior non-Pueblo rights for
claimants who do not join the  [*1187]  Settlement subject to priority
enforcement.

This objection is overruled. The Settlement Agreement does not change priority
dates. See Sections 3.1.1.1 and 3.1.2.1 (priorities for wells "shall be the
priority adjudicated in the sub-file order for each such well"); Section 3.2.1
(priorities for surface rights shall be that agreed [**79]  to by, or
adjudicated between, the State and the owner of the right, subject to inter se
challenges by other parties). While the Settlement Agreement does provide some
protection from priority enforcement to non-Pueblo claimants who join the
Settlement, it also provides that the State Engineer "shall administer the
Non-Pueblo water rights adjudicated by the Decree Court as set forth in this
Agreement and the Final Decree," and "has the authority, pursuant to state law,
to curtail non-Pueblo surface and groundwater diversions and shall exercise his
authority as necessary in order to ensure compliance with the terms of . . .
this Agreement . . . and the Final Decree." Settlement Agreement §§ 5.2 and
5.2.1.1. Section 5.3 of the Settlement Agreement provides that counsel for the
State Engineer, the United States, and the Pueblos, in consultation with counsel
for the other Settlement Parties, shall agree on a set of rules to be proposed
for adoption by the State Engineer to govern his responsibilities in
administering the non-Pueblo water rights. Those rules have not yet been
adopted. The objection that the Settlement Agreement effectively changes
priority dates is speculative and premature. See State ex rel. Office of the
State Eng'r v. Lewis, 2007- NMCA 008, 141 N.M. 1, 150 P.3d 375, 388 (N.M. Ct.
App. 2006) ("although priority [**80]  calls have been and continue to be on the
table to protect senior users' rights, such a fixed and strict administration is
not designated in the Constitution or laws of New Mexico as the sole or
exclusive means to resolve water shortages where senior users can be protected
by other means").

Pueblo Water Leasing

Some claimants object to the provision in the Settlement Agreement that allows
the Pueblos to lease their water rights stating: "A 99 year lease violates the
10-year limitation on leases of water rights and the very long term lease
violates State Law against perpetuities."

The State statute governing water use leasing was recently amended, effective
May 21, 2014, and states:


     A water use due under an adjudicated water right secured to a pueblo
     pursuant to the settlement agreements approved in Title 5 and Title 6
     of the federal Claims Resolution Act of 2010, P.L. No. 111-291,
     Sections 501-626, or in the partial final judgments and decrees
     entered pursuant to those settlement agreements, may be leased for a
     term, including all renewals, not to exceed the term specifically
     authorized in that act; provided that this subsection shall not apply
     to any water use due under any state-law based water rights acquired
     by a pueblo [**81]  or by the United States on behalf of a pueblo.


N.M. Stat. Ann. § 72-6-3(D). Thus a lease term of up to 99 years is allowed
under state law.

Other claimants object stating:


     The Pueblos can lease their water right to others for up to 99 years.
     Although the proposed Settlement Agreement states that the leased
     water must be used in the Basin, there is no protection against a
     sub-lessee removing the water from the Basin, thus the lease provision
     as written adds to the likelihood of a first priority call by the
     Pueblos if water is removed from the Basin.



Section 7.3 of Settlement Agreement expressly prohibits export of Pojoaque Basin
Water stating "No surface or ground water physically diverted within the
Pojoaque  [*1188]  Basin may be delivered for use outside of the Pojoaque
Basin." Doc. 7970-1 at 46. Consequently, a sub-lessee may not use water outside
of the Basin.

Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo

Some Objectors suggest that the Settlement Agreement will violate the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. "In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agreed
to protect rights recognized by prior sovereigns." New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537
F.2d 1102, 1108-1109 (10th Cir. 1976). Those Objectors make statements such as
"the settlement forgoes the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Rights and doesn't
consider protections [**82]  of those rights," the settlement "overrid[es] the
equal priority status of all stakeholders established and honored by the Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo," and "the settlement challenges the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo 1848, stating no 'superior access' water rights by anyone, tribe, other
entities before 1848." They do not, however, state the specific legal and
factual basis of their objection or how they will be injured or harmed by the
Settlement Agreement.

Anti-Injunction Act Violation

Some Objectors argue that the Court's January 13, 1983, Order enjoining the
State Engineer from issuing permits which allow use of domestic well water for
outdoor irrigation violates the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2283, because
the Court failed to convene a three judge court per 28 U.S.C. § 2284, and that
the Settlement Agreement is therefore void. See Atencio Response at 4-5. The
Court has already concluded that this argument is without merit stating:


     The Trujillos' arguments are without merit because neither of the
     statutes on which they rely are applicable to this case. The statute
     governing the stay of State court proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 2283,
     states:


          A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to
          stay proceedings in a State court except [**83]  as
          expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary
          in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its
          judgments.


     The preliminary injunction enjoins the State Engineer from issuing
     domestic well permits which allow use of domestic well water for
     outdoor irrigation. The preliminary injunction does not "stay
     proceedings in a State court." The statute concerning three judge
     district courts, 28 U.S.C. § 2284(a), states in part:
          A district court of three judges shall be convened when
          otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is
          filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment
          of congressional districts or the apportionment of any
          statewide legislative body.


     The Trujillos have not cited any Act of Congress which requires a
     district court of three judges for this water rights adjudication or
     to issue the preliminary injunction. This water rights adjudication
     does not challenge the constitutionality of the apportionment of
     congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide
     legislative body.


Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 10204, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177484, at *53, filed May
29, 2015 (Johnson, J.).

Property Exempt from Settlement

One Objector states: "Property deed signed by Herbert Hoover, President [**84]
of U.S. specifically segregates this well property from all future Indian Pueblo
claims or federal claims." Doc. 8096 at 2. The Objector did not provide a copy
of the deed, did not explain how the deed exempts his water right from
adjudication by the Court or administration by the State, and does not state how
implementation of  [*1189]  the Settlement Agreement will harm his water right
other than stating "Loss of well water."

Conclusion

The Court finds that the objections regarding the Settlement Agreement approval
procedure are not well taken. It is well established that settlement
negotiations may be confidential and need not involve every party, that the
Attorney General for the State of New Mexico has the power to settle this suit,
and that the Order to Show Cause was properly served. The Court also finds that
the Objectors had sufficient time and information to assess the Settlement
Agreement.

The Court finds that objections relating to the implementation of the Settlement
Agreement are unfounded, for example the allegation that the State Engineer has
a conflict of interest, are based on a mis-reading of the Settlement Agreement,
such as those claiming that they will have to transfer their [**85]  water
rights to the CWU upon entry of the Partial Final Decree, or arise from the
failure to recognize that the Settlement Agreement will not affect the water
right amounts adjudicated for those claimants who choose to not join the
Settlement. Objections that implementation of the Settlement Agreement will
violate state and/or federal laws are based on incorrect interpretations of
those laws. Finally, many of the Objections do not state the specific legal and
factual basis for their objections, or state how the claimant's water rights
will be injured or harmed in a legally cognizable way by the Settlement
Agreement and entry of the proposed decree and interim order.

The Court concludes that the Objectors have not met their burden of
demonstrating that the adoption and implementation of the Settlement Agreement
is not fair, adequate, or reasonable, is not in the public interest, or is not
consistent with applicable law. The Court, therefore, overrules the Objections.

The Court further concludes that the Settlement Agreement is fair, reasonable
and adequate. The Settlement Agreement was fairly and honestly negotiated over a
period of six years and, with amendments, approved by Congress. [**86]  See New
Mexico v. Aamodt, 582 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1319-1320 (D.N.M. 2007) (finding that
the settlement negotiations were conducted by unrelated parties, each acting
under their own self-interest, under the supervision of a neutral mediator)
(Vázquez, J.). The quantification of the Pueblos' water rights raises serious
questions of law and fact which places the ultimate outcome of the litigation in
doubt. See New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d 1102, 1113 (10th Cir. 1976) ("The
quantification of the Pueblos' rights presents another problem and in the first
instance, it must be decided by the district court. Exploration of the pertinent
law of Spain and Mexico may be required. We do not know."). The fact that
quantification of the Pueblos' rights was not resolved through litigation in the
24 years between the Tenth Circuit's statement in 1976 that it must be decided
in the first instance by the District Court and the beginning of settlement
negotiations in 2000, and the fact that the Settlement Parties were able to
agree on settlement of the Pueblos' rights in six years, and worked together for
seven more years to obtain Congressional authorization of the Settlement
Agreement and to revise the Settlement Agreement to conform to the Settlement
Act, leads the Court to two additional conclusions. First, the Court concludes
[**87]  that the value of resolving the Pueblos' water rights now by approving
the Settlement Agreement outweighs the possibility of an alternative resolution
after protracted and expensive litigation. Second, the Court concludes that the
Settlement Parties have  [*1190]  determined that the Settlement is fair and
reasonable.

IT IS ORDERED that:

(i) the Objections to the Settlement Agreement, Proposed Partial Final Judgment
and Decree on the Water Rights of the Pueblos of Tesuque, Pojoaque, Nambé and
San Ildefonso, and Interim Administrative Order are OVERRULED;

(ii) the Settlement Agreement, Doc. 7970-1, is APPROVED;

(iii) the proposed Partial Final Judgment and Decree of the Water Rights of the
Pueblos of Nambé, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, and Tesuque, Doc. 7970-3, be ENTERED;
and

(iv) the proposed Interim Administrative Order, Doc. 7970-2, be ENTERED.

Food Imports Close to Matching Level of Exports, Report Says

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

SECTION: Section C; Column 1; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 378 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23


Next year, for the first time in nearly five decades, the United States could
import as much food as it exports, the Department of Agriculture said. Until
now, the United States exported more food than it imported. One out of every
three acres in the United States is planted for export and agriculture has been
one of the few economic sectors that produced a predictable trade surplus.

But in a revised quarterly report issued this week, the Agriculture Department
predicted that in 2005 the imports of farm products would equal exports, which
are estimated at $56 billion. Foreign competition and record crop production in
the United States, which pushed down world prices for grains, oilseeds and
cottons, were blamed for the drop in export sales from the record of $62.3
billion set in this fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.

With the United States trade deficit deepening, reaching 5 percent of the gross
domestic product in its fullest expression, this forecast was unwelcome news.

Earlier this year, the Agriculture Department had predicted a $2.5 billion
surplus in agriculture for 2005.

This turnaround has occurred in less than a decade. Throughout the 1990's
agricultural products were racking up increasingly large trade surpluses; the
record, of $27.2 billion, was earned in 1996.

Indeed, political support for the $16 billion in federal farm subsidies every
year is based in part on the importance of agriculture exports.

But as the United States concentrated on farm exports, American consumers have
been buying more imported goods. This year the rise in imports was especially
marked for processed foods, essential oils used in food and beverage processing,
snack foods, red meat, wine, beer and fresh vegetables, according to the
Agriculture Department.

Canada remains the United States biggest market for agricultural products,
buying $9.7 billion. The next four projected big buyers are Mexico, at $8
billion; Japan, at $7.7 billion; the European Union, at $6.5 billion; and China,
at $4.6 billion.

Several Congressional aides said this forecast could have an effect on the
debate over the financing of farm programs in the next Congress.

New regional and international trade agreements have been held up by
agricultural and farm policies.

U.S.-Europe Pact on Meat Inspection Rules

BYLINE: Dow Jones

SECTION: Section D; Page 5; Column 5; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 188 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30


Negotiators for the United States and the European Union reached a last-minute
agreement today on meat inspection standards, according to Paul Drazek, the
United States Agriculture Department's top trade negotiator.

The agreement, which is to take effect on Oct. 1, will expand United States
exports of pork, beef, dairy and egg products and pet food to the European
Union, Mr. Drazek said.

But negotiators were unable to resolve their differences over the way United
States poultry plants treat contaminated poultry meat.

As a result, the United States will still be blocked from shipping to the
European Union about $50 million worth of poultry annually. In retaliation, the
United States will immediately ban European Union poultry exports to the United
States, which amount to only about $1 million a year, Mr. Drazek said.

The European Union rejects the use by United States poultry plants of
chlorinated water to decontaminate chicken carcasses, which the United States
Agriculture Department says is safe. In European Union plants, contaminated
poultry meat must be cut away with a knife.

China, US pledge to promote agricultural cooperation

LENGTH: 479 words


Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency) on 22 November

WASHINGTON, 22 Nov: Officials from China and United States on Tuesday [22
November] hailed the two countries' agriculture cooperation and pledged to
strengthen the partnership.

Agriculture is one of the earliest, most productive and potential areas for
Sino-US cooperation, said Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang at the China-US
Agriculture and Food Seminar held during the 27th Session of the China-US Joint
Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT).

"In the past 15 years since China joined the World Trade Organization, bilateral
agricultural trade volume witnessed an average annual growth of 17 per cent,
reaching 32.1 billion US dollars last year," said Wang.

The agricultural cooperation between China and the United States has made
fruitful achievements in trade and investment, technology exchange and personnel
training, and has made important contributions to the development of Sino-US
relationship, he said.

"The growth of food and agriculture trade between our nations is impressive,"
said US Trade Representative Michael Froman.

"From 2000 to 2015, US agriculture exports to China increased eleven-fold, and
China's agriculture exports to the United States grew seven-fold," said Froman,
adding "China has been one of our top export markets for our food and
agriculture exports for some time."

"The United States remained committed to partnering with China to achieve our
mutual goals of protecting human health and food safety while facilitating and
expanding trade,"said Tom Vilsack, US Secretary of Agriculture.

Wang said agriculture is becoming one of the fastest growing areas of investment
in China as the country is transforming its agricultural development through
structural reforms in order to meet the upgrading needs of Chinese consumers.

China and the United States can strengthen cooperation in agricultural
technology and management, "Internet plus agriculture" and co-development of
third-country markets, said Wang.

China welcomes US agricultural enterprises to invest in China and the entry of
US high-quality and safe agricultural products and food into Chinese market,he
said.

China hopes that the US will create a favourable environment for the export of
China's poultry and aquatic products to the United States, said Wang.

Wang also said it was "inevitable" for China and the United States to have some
differences in agricultural cooperation because of two countries' different
conditions.

He said China and the United States should expand the agricultural cooperation
pie with mutual efforts on deepening agricultural scientific and technological
cooperation, promoting agricultural investment and cooperation, as well as
expanding agricultural trade and innovating agricultural cooperation model.

Ready for beef at $165 a pound?

BYLINE: By Ronald E. Yates Special to The Star

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B3

DATELINE: MIYAZAKI, JAPAN


   MIYAZAKI, Japan - After losing the war to keep American beef out of Japan,
the Japanese plan to go on the offensive and sell the world's most expensive
beef to the United States.

As early as Christmas, farmers in Japan's primary beef producing areas, the
Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, say they will have $45 to $165 (U.S.) per
pound shimofuri beef in American supermarkets.

Shimofuri beef is produced from huge Japanese wagyu cattle, which are fed
high-protein grain mixed with beer for 20 months and then massaged by their
handlers. The result is highly marbled and tender beef used in cooking such
Japanese dishes as sukiyaki and shabu shabu.

American cattle, by comparison, are usually brought to market weight within 13
months and are only fed grain the last month or two before slaughter. The result
is a leaner cut of beef that the U.S. beef industry says contains less
cholesterol.

Huge boost

"Japanese wagyu beef production is as much an art form as it is agriculture,"
said Toshikazu Tanaka, marketing director for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in
Tokyo. "Selling this expensive beef in the United States will be a huge
psychological boost for an industry that feels very discouraged right now."

In order to ship their beef to the United States, Japanese farmers in Miyazaki
invested $500,000 to convert a beef-processing plant to meet rigid U.S. health
standards.

A team of U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors has been touring Japanese
beef-processing plants in Miyazaki and Kagoshima on the southern island of
Kyushu and in the Gunma prefecture north of Tokyo since early this month to see
if they meet U.S. standards. The inspectors are expected to issue a report next
month.

To help Japanese farmers in their push to export beef to the United States,
Japan's Ministry of Agriculture this year allocated $2.5 million for technical
and marketing assistance, said Tomio Noda, chief of the ministry's meat
distribution division.

"When the Japanese government agreed to liberalize the beef and citrus markets
by 1991, a lot of Japanese farmers were discouraged," Noda said. "So we want to
encourage them to go on the offensive and export to the United States." The
government agreed last year to lift all restrictions on beef imports by 1991
after years of struggle that became known as the "meat war."

The biggest question facing Japanese beef producers in America is cost.

Excellent cuts

American consumers, who can buy excellent cuts of beef for less than $4 a pound,
may balk at beef costing $45 a pound and up, admit some Japanese producers.
However, they add, in New York alone there are 200 Japanese restaurants that
marketing queries reveal will readily pay to get "real" shimofuri beef. The same
probably applies to places like Los Angeles and Chicago, they say.

"We will start with about one metric ton a month," said Arakawa. "And even
though the price will be four to five times what American beef costs, we will
target Japanese and Japanese-Americans as our initial market."

With Japan's beef market scheduled for full liberalization in 1991, Japanese
beef producers have already invested $100 million in the U.S. beef industry in
an effort to corner a share of their own market.

SWITCH AT AGRICULTURE: FEWER TIPS FOR THE COOK

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 12, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 853 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29


For the better part of a century, the United States Department of Agriculture
has been advising American homemakers how to put a healthful meal on the table.

Pamphlets and books published by the department told cooks about such things as
serving sizes, vitamins, minerals, proteins and fat, and even suggested menus.
In the Carter Administration, the department's involvement reached the point
where Americans were advised to lower consumption of such staples as beef, milk
and eggs because of the possibility that they might be associated with cancer or
heart disease.

The Reagan Administration sees the role of the department in the American
kitchen somewhat differently. As part of its drive to reduce what it considers
Federal intrusion in all aspects of American life, it is steadily cutting back
on the amount of advice given cooks and grocery shoppers.

Some new publications have been canceled. Others, once given away, now cost at
least $1.75 each and are distributed by the Government Printing Office instead
of the department. And, perhaps most important, the department has begun
reconsidering some of its more controversial statements linking some foods to
health problems.

Block Explains Shift

John R. Block, the Secretary of Agriculture and a former hog farmer, explained
the policy shift this way when he was questioned about it on Capitol Hill:

"Hogs are like people. You can provide protein and grain to a hog and he will
balance his ration. People are surely as smart as hogs.  I am not so sure the
Government needs to get so deeply into telling people what they should or should
not eat."

While the Administration's new approach pleases conservatives who are worried
about Federal intrusion, and molifies many segments of the food industry, it has
deeply disturbed consumer groups. "The department has become a big public
relations agency for the meat, egg and dairy industries, those less than perfect
foods," said Greg Moyer, spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.  The center, founded by Ralph Nader, the consumer activist,
specializes in health issues.

"There is increasing evidence about the relationship between diet and health,
and the Government should not shirk its reponsibility of providing information,"
added Ellen Haas, director of the Community Nutrition Institute, a research and
educational group.

The department's primary office for consumer education is the Human Nutrition
Information Service. A staff of eight people handles consumer inquiries and
works on publications. In the last year, the staff has revised about 20
pamphlets but produced only a couple of new ones. It also has revised a manual
for professional nutritionists to aquaint the nutritionists with new research.

"We're trying to be more creative," said Patricia Kearney, a spokesman for the
department. "Just distributing pamphlets doesn't mean you are educating the
public." The department, she added, hopes to make better use of the media and
public service announcements on radio and television to get its messages across.

The message? "It will be timely and accurate, based on sound scientific
evidence," said John Bode, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer
Services. "We are not going to launch an aggressive campaign to instruct the
public on how to eat. That is less important than providing information on
nutrition."

"I know the distinction may seem subtle at first glance," Mr.  Bode continued.
"What we are not going to do is make a national dietary prescription
nutritionists."

Staying Clear of Controversy

The department, for example, is staying clear of the controversy linking an
increased risk of cancer with the immoderate consumption of fat, a position that
earlier administrations did not shy away from. Mr. Bode said that the most
recent study in this area, conducted by the National Academy of Sciences, was
not "totally comprehensive." The study, as well as the department's previous
dietary guidelines, recommended reducing consumption of such products high in
cholesterol as beef and eggs. Until the Reagan Administration's team at the
department finishes its review of the scientific evidence, no specific
recommendations will be made, Mr.  Bode said.

But another official, a veteran civil servant at the department who would speak
only anonymously, does not expect the Administration to say anything that might
disturb powerful members of the food industry. "The Secretary can't say, 'Don't
eat too much meat,'" she said. "The cattle producers don't like that."

"A couple years ago, we were starting to get really good information out," she
continued. "Now, all of a sudden, we're not telling people anything. This
Administration is giving out nurtrition information, but no analysis. It won't
help people decide whether to eat butter or margarine or whether to drink skim
milk or whole milk."

USAID opens 2015 Pakistan agriculture conference

SECTION: Vol. 20 No. 58

LENGTH: 315  words


Director for US Agency for International Development (USAID) Pakistan Gregory
Gottlieb served as the keynote speaker to open the Pakistan Agriculture
Conference and Exposition 2015 in Islamabad.

The twoday exposition will showcase the latest technological advances in the
agriculture industry and provide government agencies and the private sector a
forum to discuss agriculture engagement strategies. The United States
contributed a five stall pavilion to exhibit the agriculture development efforts
supported by USAID in Pakistan.

Gottlieb said, "This is yet another example of how support for Pakistan's
agriculture development is a priority of the United States. We believe our
agriculture projects will continue to contribute to the growth of Pakistan's
economy. Working together with a strong cadre of local farmers, agribusinesses
and policymakers, the United States and Pakistan's joint efforts in agriculture
development will contribute to a stronger, brighter future for all Pakistan."

Agriculture employs 44 percent of the national labor force and provides 21
percent of Pakistan's Gross Domestic Product. Speakers from the Ministry of
National Food Security and Research, as well as representatives from the
Pakistan Agricultural Research Council engaged audiences on wide range of topics
and spoke strategies to improve resources and development in the agriculture
industry.

During the past five years, United States agriculture assistance has helped
nearly one million farmers increase productivity and income. This assistance
helped Pakistan directly generate over $45 million in domestic sales and $28
million in export sales.

Helping Pakistani farmers improve the quality of agricultural products while
increasing productivity is a critical priority for the United States and
approximately 800,000 farmer families have increased their incomes through the
U.S.Pakistani cooperation.

California: Seven NASDA Leaders to Attend USDA's Women in Agriculture Trade
Mission

LENGTH: 482  words

DATELINE: New York



 Sacramento: State Departments of Agriculture, The State of California has
issued the following news release:



   Leaders from seven state departments of agriculture and 23 U.S.
agribusinesses and organizations will accompany Deputy Under Secretary for Farm
and Foreign Agriculture Services Alexis Taylor on a trade mission to Hong Kong
and Shanghai Sept. 7 to Sept. 15 to extend USDA's Women in Agriculture
initiative abroad and expand export opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural
products.





 "USDA is committed to building opportunities for women to grow, learn from one
another and lead within their industries," said Taylor. "Women in agriculture
have a powerful story to tell - one of leadership, stewardship and resilience -
from the combine, to the classroom, to the boardroom. This trade mission
provides us an opportunity to discuss the impacts women in the United States and
China are having on agriculture and to share our visions for the next
generation. In addition, I look forward to joining U.S. agricultural leaders as
we seek to enhance our trading opportunities in this region."



 The United States has strong trading relations with both China and Hong Kong.
Last year, China was the second-largest market for U.S. agricultural exports
reaching $23.5 billion. Sustained high demand for bulk commodities such as
soybeans and cotton continues, and demand for high-value food, meat and alcohol
products is surging. Next year, China is projected to return as the United
States' top export market.



 In contrast to China, where more than 70 percent of U.S. exports are bulk
commodities, more than 90 percent of U.S. exports to Hong Kong are high-value,
consumer-oriented products. With a population of more than 7.2 million people
packed into 426 square miles, Hong Kong relies on imports for more than 95
percent of its food supply. It is the United States' seventh-largest market,
with top U.S. exports including tree nuts, beef, poultry and fresh fruit.



 Mission participants come from across the United States and represent a range
of agricultural products and commodities. They will meet with potential
customers and host government representatives, forging relationships and
learning about the market conditions and business environment.



 Participating U.S. Organizations and Companies:



     Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Lansing, Mich.

     Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, Jackson, Miss.

     Oklahoma Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry, Oklahoma City, Okla.

Consolidation threatens food safety, warn farmers, activists

LENGTH: 270 words


Independent farmers and environmental activist groups are asking antitrust
regulators to examine agriculture consolidation as a driver of food-borne
illnesses and other health risks allegedly fueled by practices of ag
conglomerates.Farm and environmental groups sent a joint letter to Secretary of
Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Eric Holder asking the Department
of Agriculture and the Justice Department to update the industry on what was
found in a series of field hearings the agencies conducted on agriculture
competition. The hearings began in March 2010. "The American public now awaits
the next steps the departments will take to address excessive corporate
concentration in the U.S. food and agriculture sectors and its devastating
impacts on American lives and livelihoods," the groups wrote.

They said a final report on the hearings "should include an analysis of the
scope, causes and nature of the problems and identify changes necessary to begin
to address current trends in agricultural consolidation, and develop appropriate
antitrust approaches to curtail monopoly or monopoly power of the seed, beef,
hog, poultry and dairy industries and end the harmful impacts of unrestrained
corporate power on U.S. food and farming," their letter said. "Our rural
communities, our food supply and the fate of a major portion of the American
economy depend on us fixing this problem." Groups signing the letter included:
Alliance for a Sustainable Future, American Corn Growers Association, R-CALF
United Stockgrowers of America and American Raw Milk Producers Pricing
Association.  - Bill McConnell

The United States is mounting a major diplomatic offensive against European
Common Market farm policy changes that could lead to a new trade war, United
States and other officials said today.

United States Agriculture Department officials in the 10 European Economic
Community capitals are intensively lobbying against what they regard as
disguised import levies that would affect farm trade worth $5 billion a year.
Washington's anger is shared by developing countries in Asia, Latin America and
Africa.

Officials at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's headquarters
here say the issue will be raised next month when farm ministers of the 152
member states meet for the body's top-level governing conference.

U.S. CONFISCATES SECOND FLOCK OF SHEEP OVER MAD COW FEARS

DATELINE: EAST WARREN, VT.EAST WARREN, VERMONT; MAD COW DISEASE; CONFISCATE;

* Officials plan to destroy the animals after they are tested.

U.S. officials on Friday seized the second of two flocks of dairy sheep
suspected of carrying an ailment related to mad cow disease.

The government had been fighting in the courts for nine months to seize and
destroy the animals, saying they pose a threat to the U.S. food supply. The
action began in July, when several tested positive for transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy, a class of degenerative neurological disorders that includes
scrapie and mad cow disease.

The sheep's owners charge that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's tests were
flawed, but the courts have consistently sided with the government.

Earlier in the week, the government seized another flock of sheep in Greensboro,
Vt. The action highlighted the Agriculture Department's d etermination to act
decisively to head off any risk that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, could be introduced into the United States.

About 25 federal agents from the Agriculture Department and the U.S. Marshals
Service arrived at the farm of Larry and Linda Faillace shortly after 6 a.m.

As federal agents seized the sheep, protesters mockingly gave the Nazi salute.

"They were stolen from our farm today," owner Larry Faillace said.

The 126 sheep were loaded into a truck bound for Iowa, where they will be
destroyed and their brains tested for mad cow disease.

The truck was briefly blocked by protesters before it left.

"This is a government agency completely out of control. We have no check on this
agency," protester John Barkhausen said. "It doesn't follow its own rules or
regulations."

Three Faillace children - Jackie, Francis and Heather - each held young lambs
marked with red dye.

"This is not justice," said Francis Faillace. "Where are our rights?"

The farm couple had fought to keep their flock, urging officials to first
complete tests on 234 sheep confiscated Wednesday from the farm in Greensboro,
40 miles away. The request was denied.

"This is very difficult for them," U.S. Department of Agriculture spokes man Ed
Curlett said. "This is very difficult for us as well. However, it is our duty,
it is our mission to protect American agriculture."

The sheep will be tested for one of a family of neurological diseases that
include mad cow disease. The farmers will be paid fair market value for the
sheep, U.S. officials said.

The government said some of the sheep at the two Vermont farms may have been
exposed to mad cow disease through contaminated feed before they were imported
from Europe in 1996. They have been quarantined since 1998.

The seizure of the flock earlier this week marked the first time the U.S.
government has confiscated livestock and marked it for destruction because of
mad cow fears.

Nearly 100 people in Europe have died of the human form of mad cow disease since
1995, but no cases have been confirmed in the United States.

The seizures come against a background of growing concern about food safety in
Europe and the United States. Europe is battling an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease, which has led governments to destroy tens of thousands of cows, sheep
and pigs.

Farm Prices Fell in September, U.S. Says

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: Section C; Page 22; Column 5; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 204 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30


Prices received by United States farmers for their crops and livestock were down
8.4 percent in September compared with the month last year, according to the
Agriculture Department.

The All Farm Products Index, which reflects prices for a mix of commodities, had
a September reading of 98, compared with 101 in August and 107 in September
1997, the department said in its monthly agricultural prices report.

The news will not come as a surprise to United States farmers, who have seen
prices drop this year as huge worldwide crops and meat production and the
decline of export demand from Asia, the top foreign market for United States
farm products, weigh heavily on income.

Congress is currently working on a package to help United States farmers during
the price crisis.

Wheat prices slid to their lowest level since August 1987, the department said.
Wheat prices during September reached an average $2.37 a bushel, down 2 cents
from the previous month and $1.29 lower than the same month last year.

The average corn price at $1.76 a bushel was the lowest since December 1987. The
September corn price was down 14 cents from August and 76 cents from September
1997, the Agriculture Department said.

SCIENCE WATCH;
U.S. and Russia to Swap Fungi

BYLINE: By MARY RAFFALLI

SECTION: Section C; Page 8; Column 1; Science Desk

LENGTH: 310 words


The United States Department of Agriculture announced that for the first time
its researchers are preparing a collaboration with Russian scientists to
exchange and study samples of fungi, insects and parasites.

Dr. Amy Rossman, who studies fungi and was one of the three scientists who spent
a week in Russia working out the research exchange, said this kind of scientific
trade is an important corollary of free-trade agreements.

For example, she said, if timber from Siberia is brought into the United States,
it may be infested with fungi and other plant parasites indigenous to the
region, so it is important for scientists to be aware of and understand those
organisms.

Fungi, simple plant forms that include mushrooms, molds and yeast, often cause
diseases in animals and other plants. According to the agriculture department,
fungi cause over $3.5 billion in yearly crop damage in the United States.

But some of these organisms can be beneficial. One United States entomologist,
Dr. Douglass Miller of the U.S.D.A., said he plans to work on insect-control
programs with a Russian scientist who is an international authority on flies
that eat wheat aphids, which do more than $50 million in damage to the United
States wheat crop each year.

The 200-year-old Russian insect collection is twice the age of the American
collection and has 35 million specimens, 5 million more than the United States
collection. The United States fungus collection, however, with a million

Dr. Rossman said it was not the relative sizes but the diversity of the
collections that had prompted the United States team to study Russian fungi
specimens. Initially, she plans to study a Russian fungus that causes a disease
called brown-spot in soy beans and other legumes imported to the United States.

One million farmers increase productivity with US agri assistance

LENGTH: 310  words


Nearly one million Pakistani farmers have increased their agricultural
productivity and income with the assistance of the United States during the last
five years, Director for United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) Pakistan Gregory Gottlieb said on Friday.

Speaking as keynote speaker to open Pakistan Agriculture Conference and
Exposition 2015 here, he said that this assistance helped Pakistan directly
generate over $45 million in domestic sales and $28 million in export sales.

Helping Pakistani farmers improve the quality of agricultural products while
increasing productivity is a critical priority for the United States and
approximately 800,000 farmer families have increased their incomes through the
USPakistani cooperation, he added.

The twoday exposition will showcase the latest technological advances in the
agriculture industry and provide government agencies and the private sector a
forum to discuss agriculture engagement strategies.

The United States contributed a five stall pavilion to exhibit the agriculture
development efforts supported by USAID in Pakistan. Gregory Gottlieb said that
this is yet another example of how support for Pakistan's agriculture
development is a priority of the United States.

"We believe our agriculture projects will continue to contribute to the growth
of Pakistan's economy," he added.

Working together with a strong cadre of local farmers, agribusinesses and policy
makers, the United States and Pakistan's joint efforts in agriculture
development will contribute to a stronger, brighter future for all Pakistan, he
added.

Speakers from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, as well as
representatives from the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council engaged
audiences on wide range of topics and spoke strategies to improve resources and
development in the agriculture industry.

Bush Makes Agriculture Post Choice

BYLINE: By GERALD M. BOYD, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 12, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 605 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13


President-elect Bush has decided to offer the position of Secretary of
Agriculture to Clayton K. Yeutter, now the United States Trade Representative,
Bush transition officials said today.

In addition, another Cabinet position, that of Transportion Secretary, is
virtually certain to go to Samuel K. Skinner, the chairman of the Northern
Illinois Regional Transportation Authority, the officials said. Mr. Skinner has
been among the leading contenders for the job for several days, and no strong
rival has emerged.

Both announcements could come this week.

Mr. Bush met late today with Mr. Yeutter, who associates said had not decided
whether he would take the Agriculture Department post. For weeks he has told
friends that he wants to return to the private sector after three and a half
grueling years as Trade Representative.

Help in Trade Talks

One transition official said Mr. Bush was prepared to agree that Mr. Yeutter
could serve for less than four years if that was necessary to win him over.

Mr. Yeutter is an experienced Washington hand, having worked in three
administrations in both trade and agriculture areas. He would be expected to
bring continuity in the agriculture trade negotiations between the United States
and the European Community. He has also worked closely with James A. Baker 3d,
Mr. Bush's designee for Secretary of State, and Nicholas F. Brady, Mr. Bush's
choice for Treasury Secretary.

Mr. Yeutter, who turned 58 last Saturday, received a law degree and a Ph.D. in
agricultural economics from the University of Nebraska. He has been a farmer and
a president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He joined the Reagan
Administration in July 1985, when his predecessor as Trade Representative,
William E. Brock, became Secretary of Labor.

He was Assistant Secretary of Agriculture under President Nixon and the Deputy
Trade Representative under President Ford.

As President Reagan's Trade Representative, he promoted an aggressive posture to
force some trading partners to open their markets further to American goods. In
his tenure, the United States also completed a free-trade agreement with Canada.

Another leading candidate for the top Agriculture post had been Representative
E. Thomas Coleman, Republican of Missouri. But Mr. Bush indicated on Monday that
he would not name any Republicans in Congress to his Cabinet so as not to
deplete their numbers.

That decision removed several other legislators from consideration for Cabinet
positions, including Representatives Lynn Martin of Illinois, Guy V. Molinari of
New York, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas.

Defense Choice Near

Mr. Bush is close to making his choice for Secretary of Defense, transition
officials also said. Mr. Bush's legal advisers are expected to meet Wednesday
with former Senator John G. Tower of Texas to review an investigation of his
background by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Aides said the meeting could
be the final step before a formal announcement.

Besides considering personnel matters, Mr. Bush met for about 20 minutes today
with Coretta Scott King, the widow of The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was
one in a series of meetings that Mr. Bush has held with civil rights leaders
since the election.

Mrs. King, describing the sesssion with Mr. Bush as ''very warm and cordial,''
said they discussed the elimination of what she called the ''triple evils:''
war, racism and poverty.

''We don't disagree on goals,'' she said. ''The goals that he seems to want for
his administration are very similar to the goals that I would like to see.''

U.S.-Soviet Grain Talks

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: Section D; Page 7, Column 6; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 194 words

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 30


A United States Government delegation began talks in Moscow today on the sale of
millions of tons of grain to the Soviet Union, now facing its third poor harvest
in a row.

The seven-man team, headed by Agriculture Department Under Secretary Seeley
Lodwick, met Soviet negotiators at the Foreign Trade Ministry for what are
expected to be two days of hard bargaining.

The United States has said it is ready to offer Moscow at least 10 million tons
of wheat and corn and as much as 18 million tons. This would be in addition to a
maximum of eight million tons allowed under a current United States-Soviet sales
agreement.

United States farmers have had record grain harvests this year while the Soviet
crop, hit by drought in some areas and floods in others, is expected by
Agriculture Department experts to be the worst since the disastrous year of
1975.

But United States officials say Moscow is likely to give a cool reception to the
offer of millions of tons of additional American supplies, and to try to cover
its needs from non-United States sources.

Washington gears up for wheat battle

BYLINE: Peter Morton, Washington Bureau Chief

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 479 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


Washington has launched two new probes into Canada's rising wheat exports to the
U.S.

One is being done by the U.S. Government Accounting Office, which looks into
claims of government fraud. Since late 1997 it has been looking into U.S.
imports of Canadian wheat and the role of the Canadian Wheat Board.

The GAO audit is parallel to one announced yesterday by U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman, after a meeting with Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle
Vanclief.

The unusual GAO audit may be used by U.S. negotiators to demand the dismantling
of state-run sales and marketing operations, such as the CWB, when global farm
trade talks start in 1999, a senior GAO official said.

'This has implications far beyond just the wheat board,' said GAO assistant
director Phil Thomas.

Canada and the U.S. have been at odds over the high level of Canadian wheat
exports to the U.S., partly because U.S. wheat and grain has been unable to
enter Canada.

In a bid to ease tensions, Vanclief said a pilot project is being set up to
allow U.S. grain to be easily shipped to Canada.

'It would help to quell the feeling that perhaps we are in an unfair trading
scenario,' Glickman said.

But the U.S. is still convinced the CWB unfairly subsidizes Canadian farmers
because it refuses to make public the prices it gets on global wheat sales.

The GAO began the audit late last year at the request of Senator Byron Dorgan, a
long-time critic of the CWB. His spokesman said: 'The senator believes Canada is
engaging in unfair trade practices and has violated handshake agreements to
limit exports.'

So far, GAO investigators have talked to Canadian officials in Ottawa and at CWB
headquarters in Winnipeg. The probe is not expected to wrap up until mid-year.

U.S. officials say Canadian wheat shipments to the U.S. were expected to reach a
record 1.6 million tonnes last year. Canadian officials refused to reveal an
exact figure.

Dorgan has claimed Canadian officials told him and the U.S. administration that
Ottawa would voluntarily cap exports as it did in 1994. Ottawa denies making any
pledges.

Vanclief said Canada has no intention of limiting grain exports to the U.S. this
year. He said Ottawa is not worried about the audit ordered by Glickman. 'This
is not the first time that an audit has taken place. The actions of the wheat
board show that it is trading fairly.'

U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky tried to pressure Ottawa into
making concessions on wheat late last year when President Bill Clinton was
trying, unsuccessfully, to get Congress to give him fast-track trade negotiating
authority.

Clinton needs the unique power to continue to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement to Chile and beyond. Congress refused, and is unlikely to vote
approval this year because of U.S. mid-term elections and the unpopularity of
free trade.

U.S.-SOVIET ACCORD ON FARMS SIGNED

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 8, Column 4; Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 357 words

DATELINE: MOSCOW, June 18


The Under Secretary of Agriculture, Daniel Amstutz, said here today that the
Soviet Union and the United States had agreed to resume agricultural cooperation
broken off after Soviet forces swept into Afghanistan in late 1979.

He said at a news conference that an accord signed after two days of talks
provided for exchanges of information, research and application of technology in
a number of agricultural areas. The two countries already have an agreement
regarding grain sales.

The new accord provides for exchanges of scientists and crop information,
although, Mr. Anstutz said, ''not be as much as we would like.''

Since 1980, the Soviet Union has imposed total secrecy on the size of its grain
harvest and on grain yields per acre, both on a national basis and for
individual regions. It still reports the size of other major crops such as sugar
beets, cotton, sunflower seeds and flax.

Mr. Amstutz said the current agreement, which resumes agricultural contacts
first started in 1973, took six months to negotiate. It follows a statement by
President Reagan last year that he wanted closer links in a number of areas,
including agriculture.

The Soviet Agriculture Minister, Valentin K. Mesyats, was in the United States
late last year and invited Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block to return the
visit.

The accord today provides for an exchange of 15 Soviet and 15 American young
farmers who will exchange places to learn about farming methods.

He said Soviet officials sounded optimistic about this year's grain crop and
expected it to exceed last year's, though no figures were offered.

The United States Department of Agriculture makes its own estimates of the
Soviet grain crop in the absence of Soviet official information, and expects the
grain crop this year to be 195 million metric tons compared with an estimate of
175 million for the 1984 harvest.

Agriculture has been a perennial trouble area in the Soviet economy, with a
series of poor harvests in the early 1980's. The average grain crop in the
five-year period 1976-80, before a statistical blackout was imposed in 1981, was
205 million metric tons.

U.S. move to hike export subsidies could hurt Canada

BYLINE: Johanna Powell

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 368 words

DATELINE: Edmonton,Alta.


  Despite assurances to the contrary, the Bush administration has proposed a 60%
increase in export subsidies in its trade war with Europe - meaning Canadian
farmers may be the victims.

The increase to US$900 million ($1.06 trillion) from US$566 million in the Bush
administration's request for the Export Enhancement Program is ''very bad news,
especially for Prairie farmers,'' Don Knoerr, president of the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture, said yesterday.

The administration's fiscal 1991 budget for the Agriculture Department - part of
Bush's overall US$1.23 trillion spending blueprint - said US$900 million would
be spent on subsidizing agricultural exports, a US$334-million increase from the
limit imposed this year. Export subsidies have been a major U.S. tool in
combating the policies of competitors.

The subsidies are applied mainly to wheat and, to a lesser extent, eggs and
vegetable oil.

Knoerr said the U.S. is clearly raising the ante in its trade war with the
European Community, and the Canadian treasury does not have the resources to
compete.

Canada's ability to play is limited and ''our farmers are the losers,'' Knoerr
said.

Only last month, Agriculture Minister Don Mazankowski was assured by U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter that the EEP would be reduced in the 1991
fiscal budget.

A spokesman for Mazankowski yesterday said there would be no comment from the
department until the official figures have been studied.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the main reason
behind boosting the request for the EEP by $334 million from this year's
allocated $566 million is to pressure the EC into talking about subsidies during
the current round of GATT negotiations, due to end in December.

The spokesperson said the department has a new policy of looking carefully at
the impact of the EEP on non-subsidizing nations such as Canada and Australia,
and is trying to ensure that their market share is maintained.

Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter said that the EEP provided leverage for
bargaining with the EC ''to neutralize the export subsidies of other countries
if and when necessary.''

U.S. SHARPLY INCREASES FARM EXPORTS TO CHINA

BYLINE: By JAMES P. STERBA, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 2; Page 38, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 325 words

DATELINE: PEKING, June 19


China has quietly become the United States' fourth-largest customer of food and
other agricultural commodities, with an estimated 12 million acres of American
farmland now planted annually to grow crops bound for China, according to
American agriculture officials.

American exports of food grains and fiber to China rose to more than $2 billion
last year from $64 million in 1977. Sales this year are expected to exceed $2.5
billion. Wheat accounted for roughly half the total last year.

Under an agreement signed last October, the Chinese have agreed to buy a minimum
of six million tons of wheat annually through 1984.

Drought in North China

For the wheat-buying year, ending June 30, China has so far purchased more than
8.5 million tons from the United States. The wheat has helped to make up for
domestic production shortfalls, the result primarily of drought in the North
China plain.

China buys all of its American grain on the open market without Washington's
participation, an American agricultural official at the embassy here said. But
under the October grain agreement, Peking has promised to consult with the
United States Department of Agriculture if its grain buying exceeds nine million
tons annually.

American agricultural exports to China will amount to 55 to 61 percent of all
American exports to that country this year. China's total imports from the
United States may top $4.5 billion this year, representing about 20 percent of
China's imports.

United States cotton shipments to China reached nearly $700 million last year,
or roughly one-fourth of America's total cotton exports.  China uses the cotton
to produce textiles and clothing, which now accounts for about half of its
exports to the United States.

Corn and soybean oil are other major American food exports to China - each
amounting to nearly $200 million last year.

Washington: Secretary Kerry, Secretary Vilsack Launch Global Alliance for
Climate-Smart Agriculture

LENGTH: 708  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Department of Agriculture, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

The United States is a founding member of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart
Agriculture. As part of its commitment to promoting climate smart agriculture
around the world, the U.S. government supports the following initiatives:

In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) manages seven
"Climate Hubs" around the country to deliver information to farmers, ranchers
and forest landowners to help them adapt to climate change and weather
variability.
 The Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, to which the
United States contributes, aims to deepen and broaden mitigation research
through collaboration and data sharing.
 Feed the Future, the U.S. government's global hunger and food security
initiative, focuses on agriculture-led development to spur broad-based economic
growth that can reduce hunger, poverty, and under nutrition. It is helping
mitigate risks of climate change by supporting smallholder farmers in producing
more and better quality foods, improving access to new tools and technologies,
and building resilience while using land, energy, water and other inputs more
efficiently.
 Feed the Future is pairing American ingenuity and expertise with some of the
best and brightest minds across the globe through its 24 Feed the Future
Innovation Labs, a unique network supported by more than 60 top U.S. colleges
and universities along with many partner country research and educational
institutions.
 The United States helped create the Climate and Clean Air Coalition on
Short-Lived Pollutants, housed at the UN Environment Program, which includes an
action-oriented Agriculture Initiative to address methane and black carbon
emissions associated with open agricultural burning, paddy rice production, and
livestock management.
 The U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative provides climate-related assistance
to more than 50 developing countries. Programs, like the SERVIR climate data
hubs, help developing countries build the critical capacities they need to
increase resilience to changes in climate, to protect lives and livelihoods, and
to promote low-carbon growth and development.

The United States also supports multilateral funds and organizations that
provide dedicated financing to agricultural development in developing countries.

The United States is the largest donor to the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program, which has provided $912 million in grant financing to support
agricultural development in the world's poorest countries. About one-third of
the current portfolio, or roughly $300 million, focuses on climate adaptation
and mitigation activities.
 The United States is also the largest contributor to the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, which finances climate smart agriculture in the
poorest and most vulnerable agricultural communities.
 U.S. support to the international Climate Investment Funds (CIF), including the
Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), helps the most vulnerable countries
protect their economies and citizens from the negative effects of climate
change. Agriculture and land management are one of the key sectors supported by
the PPCR. The Forest Investment Program (FIP) is providing more than $600
million for activities to address reducing emissions from deforestation and
degradation - often with significant agriculture components - in Brazil, Burkina
Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Laos, Mexico, and Peru.
 In partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency and a range of private
and non-profit partners, USDA has created a new Food Waste Challenge to
encourage people to find new ways to reduce food loss and waste, to recover
unneeded, wholesome food that can help feed those in need, and to recycle wasted
food as much as possible. Food is the single largest component of municipal
solid waste going to landfills - and those landfills are the third largest
source of methane. By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can
help reduce these potent greenhouse gas emissions.

U.S. plans subsidy on wheat sales to Mexico

DATELINE: Washington, DC


The U.S. will subsidize its wheat exports to Mexico to counter growing Canadian
sales, congressmen said yesterday.

Senator Byron Dorgan said the White House told him yesterday that the
administration will define Canada as a ''subsidizer,'' a move that will enable
the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use its export enhancement program to
subsidize wheat sales to Mexico.

Representative Tim Johnson also said he was notified by the White House of the
decision. He is chairman of the House of Representatives' agriculture
subcommittee on general farm commodities.

Neither White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers, nor Agriculture Department
spokesman Tom Amontree, was aware of the decision.

Dorgan said the administration plans to increase all wheat sales under the
program by 10%, in part to allow for sales to Mexico. He did not know how much
would be set aside for Mexico.

Other congressional sources said the amount would include one million tonnes of
wheat for Mexico.

U.S. wheat-growers face price declines. On some markets, per bushel prices have
dropped below US$3 because of the largest expected harvest since 1984 and a
declining export market.

Whose beef is the safest?;
BSE debate highlights Japan-U.S. split on meat inspection

The diagnosis of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States and the
resultant ban on U.S. beef imports in Japan clearly shows the different
approaches to food safety in Japan and the United States.

The two countries are expected to hold heated discussions on the issue as the
United States insists that U.S. beef is safe while Japan wants to ensure
consumers peace of mind.

During a visit by a government fact-finding mission earlier this month, U.S.
Agriculture Department officials emphasized that U.S. inspections for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy were being carried out for the purpose of
surveillance, not food safety.

Hirofumi Kugita, who was one of the members of the team and is director of the
International Animal Health Affairs Office of the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry said: "For them, a scientific safety measure is to remove any
sections of cattle carcasses that are likely to contain BSE, or specified risk
material. They believe getting rid of these parts makes the meat safe."

The U.S. government announced Jan. 12 that all specified risk material would be
separated from all cattle 30 months or older when they are processed by a
slaughterhouse and banned the distribution of meat from cattle that were unable
to walk.

In a New York Times article last month, Ron DeHaven, the chief veterinarian at
the U.S. Agriculture Department, said Japan had overreacted and was "like a
doctor testing every patient who comes through the door for prostate cancer."

However, even opinions in the United States are divided, as some have criticized
U.S. measures.

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who is a candidate hoping to win the Democratic
presidential nomination, said that it cost only "three cents per pound" (453
grams) of beef to inspect all of the cattle.

However, the U.S. Agriculture Department maintains its stance that current
measures are sufficient.

The United States is proud of being the first country to introduce BSE
countermeasures.

BSE surveillance began in 1990 in the United States, six years before Japan. The
country also banned the use of meat-and-bone meal as cattle feed in August 1997,
four years before Japan. Meat-and-bone meal is one of the suspected sources of
BSE infection.

However, Japan imposed the most rigorous BSE measures in the world.

"Japan takes scientific safety measures. But more than that, we carry out
measures to ensure peace of mind (for consumers)," an Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry official said. "That's a big difference from the United
States," the official added.

Japan introduced inspection of all cows after the first BSE case was confirmed
in September 2001. This measure was seen as a way to reassure consumers of the
safety of food products.

An executive of a Tokyo nongovernmental organization on food safety also
highlighted the differences between the ways Japan and the United States view
food safety.

"For many Americans, food safety means methods that prevent obesity. Their
concerns are surprisingly different (to Japanese consumers)," Junichi Kowaka,
secretary general of the Japan Offspring Fund, said.

The different scale of livestock industries' business in each country is another
factor that demonstrates the differing views on food safety.

About 1.14 million cows are processed for meat annually in Japan, compared to 35
million cows per year in the United States.

Some observers have said the reluctance demonstrated by the United States to
introduce inspection of all cows reflects the opinions of the U.S. agriculture
industry, which is hesitant to implement checks on such a large number of cows.

Seoul also took the news of the first U.S. BSE case seriously as about 40
percent of the beef sold in South Korea comes from the United States.

However, only a few stories concerning the issue of inspections in the United
States were published in the South Korean media. BSE stories reported in the
country mainly dealt with the disease's impacts on the distribution industry.

The issue of inspecting all U.S. cattle is expected to remain the main topic of
negotiations between Japan and the United States.

"If we lift the ban on U.S. beef now and another BSE case is discovered,
Japanese consumers will never buy U.S. beef again," a senior Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said.

"It will benefit the United States if it introduces high level measures now,"
the senior official added, expressing hopes for a compromise from the United
States.

NFU President Brings Expertise in Agriculture, NFU Cooperative Model to Ghana;
Meets with the President, Minister of Food and Agriculture

LENGTH: 374  words

DATELINE: Washington


National Farmers Union has issued the following press release:

National Farmers Union (NFU) President Roger Johnson arrived in the Republic of
Ghana today to discuss the history of NFU and the development of cooperatives in
the United States at the National Food and Agric Show (FAGRO). Johnson will also
meet with President John Dramani Mahama, Minister for Food and Agriculture Fifi
Kwetey and Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Sherry Ayitey to discuss how
cooperatives can promote sustainable agriculture in Ghana.

"I am excited to be able to discuss and promote cooperatives as a means for
agricultural sustainability in Ghana," said Johnson. "Cooperatives provide
education and training for members, managers and employees, who can then utilize
that knowledge to effectively develop not only their cooperatives, but also
their communities."

Johnson noted that Farmers Union has a rich history of supporting and developing
cooperatives, and with that comes the ability to speak to the successes of
cooperatives in agriculture. Through the technical assistance and funding
provided by Farmers Union, cooperatives throughout the United States have been
able to benefit their local communities.

"Ghanaian officials have reached out to NFU in the past to explore the
cooperative model in the United States," said Johnson. "I believe that the
successes of the Farmers Union push for cooperatives in the United States can be
modeled in Ghana for the betterment of their agriculture industry."

Johnson will also be the guest speaker at the opening ceremony of FAGRO 2014,
where he will speak on the topics of sustainable agricultural growth and
development, and treating agriculture as a business.  He noted that Ghana's
economy relies heavily upon its agriculture sector, as it represents 21 percent
of the nation's GDP and 52 percent of the labor force.

"The health and vibrancy of Ghana's agriculture sector, just as it is in the
United States, is incredibly important to the health and vibrancy of the entire
nation," said Johnson. "I am happy to be able to help in the development of a
sustainable model for agriculture in Ghana."

Sugar Import Plan Blocked

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: Section D; Page 20, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 236 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9


The Agriculture Department announced this week that it lacks the legal authority
to carry out a program passed by Congress in December that would subsidize the
re-export of foreign-produced sugar.

The one-year program was intended to compensate developing nations for sharp
cuts in the United States sugar-import quota, now at 750,000 tons a year, which
keeps American prices above world rates. Government-owned commodities would
subsidize the re-export of refined sugar that was first imported in its raw form
at higher United States prices.

Under the plan, Caribbean nations could sell the United States 290,000 tons of
sugar and the Philippines 110,000 tons above prescribed quotas at the United
States price of 18 cents a pound. The world price is slightly more than 8 cents.

The controversial quotas prop up United States prices to protect a few thousand
American sugar growers.

Congress failed to give the Agriculture Department the authority it needed to
subsidize the re-export of foreign agricultural products, said John Nuttal, head
of the department's sugar group, in announcing the decision, which was reached
Tuesday.

The Reagan Administration is divided on how to respond to the department's
decision, according to one official. Representatives of affected countries said
failure to carry out the program would cost them about $97 million in lost sugar
sales at the higher United States price.

PEI farmers fear   U.S. potato ban   Growers seek compensation after   seed
spuds found to have a virus

BYLINE: DEBORAH JONES; SPCL

BY DEBORAH JONES
Special to The Globe and Mail
  HALIFAX
 Potato farmers on Prince Edward Island will meet federal officials in PEI
this week to discuss compensation for tens of millions of dollars in
losses caused by a U.S. ban on seed potato imports.

"It's the gravest issue that has ever hit the PEI potato industry,"
said Robert Heaney, a farmer in Kensington.

Tom Van Dusen, spokesman for federal Agriculture Minister Donald
Mazankowski, said it will be at least two weeks before a decision is made
on compensation.

Scientists have identified the PVY-N virus, known as the necrotic
strain of potato virus Y, on between 1 and 2 per cent of potatoes on 14
PEI farms.

Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture told Agriculture Canada
that imports of seed potatoes from all but a small part of PEI are
prohibited.

Severe restrictions placed early this month on all potato imports from
PEI and New Brunswick were relaxed by the United States last week, leaving
most PEI farmers scrambling to find markets for their seed potatoes.

Table potatoes can be imported into the United States if treated with a
chemical to inhibit growth of sprouts or if used in processing.

Canada exports about 120,000 tonnes of seed potatoes, worth about $40-
million, annually throughout the world. About 90 per cent of the potatoes
come from PEI and New Brunswick and the biggest export market is the
United States.

The restrictions were imposed early this month after a January
conference of a U.S. potato association. A Canadian scientist presented
research on a 1989 PVY-N virus infection of an Ontario tobacco crop, which
was traced to PEI seed potatoes, which were previously considered clear of
the virus.

The virus does not affect humans or even the potatoes that carry it,
but can devastate tobacco crops and possibly harm tomato and pepper plants
when transmitted by insects. The strain of the virus is common throughout
the world, but North America has been considered largely clear of it. No
one knows how PEI potatoes became infected.

Scientists had known of the PEI problem for many months and were
dealing with it - Agriculture Canada quarantined several PEI farms in
December - when, without warning, the United States slapped restrictions
on Canadian potatoes.

Ben Borrel, chief of technical services for Agriculture Canada, said
Canada informed the United States of the problem at a Sept. 28 meeting in
Washington.

But Stephen Poe, a plant pathologist with the USDA, said the United
States was not formally notified. "Either they didn't tell us real good,
or we didn't pick up on it real good . . . no serious attention was paid
until January. Potatoes were routinely coming in. Somehow, someone looked
at this and said, 'Whoa, this is a problem.' "
   Canadian industry and government officials charge the sudden U.S.
embargo is prompted by trade protectionism more than plant protection.

PEI Agriculture Minister Keith Milligan suggested the United States
could be the source of the infection and asked Ottawa to inspect seed
tubers entering Canada. "Our eradication efforts cannot be jeopardized by
the risk of infection from the U.S."

PEI farmers are seeking federal compensation of up to $200,000 each
because this summer's crop cannot be sold to important U.S. markets, and
because of expected long-term damage to markets and to PEI's reputation
for growing healthy seed potatoes.

"The only way for this portion of our industry to recover is through
massive compensation," said George Webster, chairman of the PEI potato
board.

US agriculture secretary mending fences in Canada

BYLINE: BY COURTNEY TOWER

SECTION: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 614 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman is reaching out to Canadian
agriculture industry leaders this week to form a U.S.-Canada consensus on global
farm trade issues.

But Mr. Glickman has also criticized Canada's agricultural support mechanisms -
and some Canadians have returned the criticism by noting examples of U.S. farm
subsidies.

In talks to bring agriculture within Word Trade Organization rules reducing
tariffs, quotas and other trade-distorting protections, the United States will
draw a special bead on ""state trading agencies,'' and in particular the
Canadian Wheat Board, Mr. Glickman said in a speech to Canadian farm and agri-
food business representatives.

AUDIENCE APPLAUDS GLICKMAN

The audience did applaud Mr. Glickman's statements declaring that the United
States would offer tough leadership on export subsidy issues and other barriers
to free-market trade.

But questioners who said the United States would do well first to reduce its own
subsidy supports to farmers also were applauded.

The new round of negotiations, to bring agriculture and financial services under
World Trade Organization auspices, begins Nov. 30 in Seattle.

Mr. Glickman said the United States would propose the elimination of export
subsidies, particularly those doled out by the European Union, and to ""rein in
the trade-distorting practices of what we perceive to be state trading
enterprises.''

""I recognize that this is a serious bone of contention between our two
countries, particularly with respect to the Canadian Wheat Board,'' he said. But
the world had to look at everything that distorts markets, he noted.

The Canadian Wheat Board markets all Western Canada's export wheat and barley,
about a fifth of world wheat exports.

U.S. agriculture representatives and politicians say that it effectively
subsidizes wheat exports and sells at less than market rates in order to grab
market share.

Canada says the CWB is paid for collectively by farmers, receives no government
financial aid, and because of its size and 70 years of expertise is adept at
marketing grain for the best prices.

PERENNIAL TRADE ISSUE

The CWB has been a perennial agricultural trade issue between the United States
and Canada.

One U.S. agricultural trade objective in the coming world negotiations includes
reducing tariffs, officials have said, adding the United States has the lowest
agricultural tariffs in the world.

A second U.S. goal would be to ""discipline'' so-called tariff-rate quotas
(TRQs). These are prohibitive tariffs many countries place on imports of foods,
especially sensitive to their own agriculture industries. Tariffs can run as
high as 300 percent. The high tariffs replace former prohibitive import quotas
and bans on such goods, but do the same job.

US HAS ITS TRQS

The United States has its own TRQs on peanuts, sugar and cotton. Canada applies
TRQs to dairy products, eggs and poultry.

Mr. Glickman said a third U.S. objective would be for countries to discipline
domestic subsidies to agriculture as well.

The United States has many agriculture support programs, and last year passed
legislation providing more than $6 billion in emergency support for farmers, he
said. But none of these distorted trade and were ""well within'' WTO limits, Mr.
Glickman said.

Mr. Glickman, addressing reporters after the speech, said the Canadian Wheat
Board lacked transparency on its trades, prices and volumes, while, generally
speaking, private U.S. grain companies were more transparent.

He refused to say whether the U.S. would be appeased if the Canadian Wheat Board
became equally transparent with U.S. grain trading companies.

U.S. Charter Airline Cited for Neglecting Cargo of Macaques From China

BYLINE: SHAOJIE HUANG

SECTION: WORLD; asia

LENGTH: 541 words



HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Air Transport International
failed to provide food and water for more than 24 hours to the crab-eating
macaques it flew to Houston from Guangzhou on Dec. 7.


An American charter airline has been accused by the United States Department of
Agriculture of violating an animal protection law while shipping monkeys to
laboratories in the United States from China.

In its inspection report, the Agriculture Department said that Air Transport
International shipped 1,148 crab-eating macaques to Houston from the southern
Chinese city of Guangzhou on Dec. 7 and failed to provide the animals with food
and water for more than 24 hours, in violation of the Animal Welfare Act. The
report also cited insecure crates that it said put the animals in danger.

The case reflects recent shifts in the international trade in animals for
experiments, as more commercial airlines have halted such shipments under
pressure from animal welfare advocates, and as research facilities and
pharmaceutical companies have increasingly had to rely on charter flights - a
more expensive alternative.

China is the leading supplier of primates to the United States, exporting more
than 10,000 monkeys in 2013, or 56 percent of the total, according to the
International Primate Protection League, an advocacy group. Crab-eating
macaques, which are widely used in biomedical experiments, are not native to
China but are bred there commercially for export. The cost of raising a monkey
in China is about half that of the United States.

It is the second time Air Transport International has run afoul of the law while
transporting monkeys from China for laboratory research. In July, it was accused
of neglecting to feed more than 1,700 macaques for more than 32 hours.

Air Transport International and Air Transport Services Group, its parent
company, did not respond to requests, via telephone and email, for comment. The
Agriculture Department has not opened an investigation on either citation of
noncompliance yet, said a department public affairs specialist, Tanya Espinosa,
adding that the report was posted on the department's database on Jan. 2.

If an investigation confirms the inspector's report, the Agriculture Department
may impose a fine. Last year, China Southern Airlines, a state-owned carrier,
settled an animal welfare violation charge with the Agriculture Department and
paid a fine of $11,600. It later announced that it would no longer transport
monkeys to the United States.

China Southern's decision to end such transports was hailed by the People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other animal welfare advocates who have
campaigned for years to cut off the supply of monkeys for laboratory
experiments. But defenders of such experiments argue that primates, and other
species, cannot be completely replaced, and that the greater reliance on charter
airlines only increases the cost of important research.

"The shipments they are doing are quite large, as you can see in these reports,"
Justin Goodman, PETA's director of laboratory investigations, said of the
charter flights. "Unfortunately they are picking up the slack of many Chinese
companies that now refuse to take part in this bloody industry, and they are
capitalizing on that."

Another challenge is that charter airlines "are not as accountable to the public
as the passenger airlines," Mr. Goodman said. "They are able to fly under the
radar a little more."

U.S. SEEKS PLAN TO AVOID SALES OF BUTTER TO SOVIET

BYLINE: Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 16, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 575 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10


At the request of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., President Reagan has
rejected an Agriculture Department recommendation that the United States dispose
of its surplus butter in the open market, where it might be purchased by the
Soviet Union.

White House officials said today that, instead, Mr. Reagan has directed
Agriculture Secretary John R. Block to devise ways of selling the butter while
making sure that it does not end up in Russian hands.

Mr. Haig had argued against an unrestricted sale on the ground that it would
send the ''wrong signal'' to the Russians at a time of rising American concern
about Soviet behavior around the world, the official said.

Mr. Reagan's preliminary decision on butter sales, made at a Cabinet meeting
last week, was seen by White House officials as a victory for Mr. Haig, who had
earlier argued without success against lifting the curbs on grain sales to the
Russians.

The Secretary of State had warned that lifting the grain sale curbs would also
be a ''wrong signal.'' In that case, however, he was overruled because Mr.
Reagan had promised to lift the curbs during the Presidential campaign. White
House officials also maintained that the grain sale curbs had not been effective
in their originally stated purpose of punishing the Russians for their 1979
military intervention in Afghanistan.

Surplus of 400 Million Pounds

The United States has accumulated a surplus of more than 400 million pounds of
butter, which it buys from American farmers at prices below the American market
price and then freezes and stores.  World butter prices are now below the
American market price. If the Russians had bought the butter at world prices,
the United States might have been seen as subsidizing the Russians' ability to
get a cut-rate deal on the butter.

The United States purchased the butter at roughly $1.50 a pound, a price set by
Federal legislation, according to the Agriculture Department. The world price
for butter is $1 a pound.

An aide to Mr. Reagan said today that the President had been persuaded by the
argument that it would look bad for the United States to be seen subsidizing
Russian butter purchases.

American consumers purchase butter for about $2 a pound, so that the United
States would also be selling the butter overseas a prices better than those
available to Americans. This aspect also contributed to Mr. Reagan's reluctance
to sell the butter to the Russians, White House officials said.

''The matter is still under consideration,'' the aide said.  ''There's a series
of other options the Agriculture Secretary is looking at, so that we can sell
the butter at the world price without it going to the Soviets. We have all this
butter sitting here, purchased by the Government, and it would be nice to do
something to recoup the money that's been spent.''

Agriculture officials have said that the Soviet Union is the one nation that
seems to be most in need of butter at the present time, and they doubted whether
there would be a market for the purchases if the Russians were ruled out.

A White House official said the new options being put together by Mr. Block
would likely be discussed next week at another Cabinet meeting.

Agriculture Minister ridiculed in House

BYLINE: DANIEL LEBLANC

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 293 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief painted himself as a security threat
yesterday, saying he was not allowed into the Summit of the Americas to discuss
the PEI potato ban with his American counterpart.

"Arrangements could not be made for security reasons for me to get into the
summit," he said in the Commons. Opposition MPs ridiculed Mr. Vanclief's excuse
for not attending the summit.

"Why could the Prime Minister not get the Minister of Agriculture in? The
secretary of state from the United States got in. Why could the Minister of
Agriculture not get into the talks?" Conservative MP Rick Borotsik asked.

Mr. Vanclief has been embarrassed on a number of occasions during the potato
dispute with the United States.

Last October, the United States banned all imports of Prince Edward Island
potatoes after a wart fungus was discovered in one field.

Recently, Mr. Vanclief was criticized by PEI politicians and farmers for saying
that the United States was unlikely to back away from the ban and that farmers
should consider growing something else or developing other markets.

Then he announced that the United States had agreed to lift the import ban if
certain conditions were met. He was later forced to backtrack, after the
Americans insisted that their position had not changed.

Mr. Vanclief insisted yesterday that negotiations are moving along positively,
in part thanks to a telephone conversation with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann
Veneman.

"I did not have to spend thousands of taxpayer dollars to be there for a
meeting, and our officials are in Washington this afternoon to continue those
discussions," he said.

Mr. Vanclief also pointed out that Prime Minister Jean Chrétien had raised the
issue with U.S. President George W. Bush.

Washington: United States and Five African Countries Announce Intention To Join
Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture

LENGTH: 586  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Secretary of State has issued the following news release:

Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania and the United States confirmed last
week their intention to join the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture
(GACSA). At the August 4 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit event entitled "Resilience
and Food Security in a Changing Climate," Secretary of State John Kerry
announced the United States' intention to join GACSA and encouraged African
countries to participate. The event highlighted the nexus of food security,
climate change, and resilience - issues that are of particular concern among
African nations, where much of the population, relying on rain-fed agriculture,
is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on rainfall patterns
and seasonal temperatures.

Slated for launch at the UN Secretary General's Climate Summit on September 23,
GACSA is expected to engage a range of government, multinational organizations,
private sector, farmers and civil society stakeholders to achieve sustainable
increases in agricultural productivity, greater resilience and a reduction of
agriculture-related greenhouse gas emissions.

The United States supports climate-smart agriculture globally through its Feed
the Future and Global Climate Change initiatives. This year, USAID initiated ten
new Feed the Future Innovation Laboratories to increase global food security and
help smallholder farmers boost incomes and improve nutrition. These laboratories
draw the expertise of top U.S. universities and developing country research
institutions, and will tackle some of the world's most challenging agricultural
research problems with the premise of introducing safe, environmentally
sustainable proven and appropriate technologies to the world's most vulnerable
people.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the
establishment of seven regional climate hubs to deliver information to farmers,
ranchers and forest landowners in the United States to help them adapt to
climate change and weather variability.

The U.S. State Department also supports targeted programs that advance climate
resilience and food security throughout the world including through
contributions to the multilateral Least Developed Countries Fund and Special
Climate Change Fund and through support for the Climate and Clean Air
Coalition's new Agriculture Initiative.

Full text of the joint announcement:

Statement of Endorsement for a Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture

The Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for
Shared Prosperity includes, in Section VI, a Commitment to Enhancing Resilience
of Livelihoods and Production Systems to Climate Variability and other related
risks. This commitment is consistent with the aspirations of those supporting
the founding, later this year, of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart
Agriculture (GACSA).

Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, and the United States announce our
intention to:

Join and support the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture expected to
be launched in September of this year at the UN Secretary General's Climate
Summit.
 Urge other countries, along with civil society organizations, private sector
representatives, farmer organizations, and other enterprises to join the Global
Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture to help fulfill our shared aspirations
for strengthened global food and nutrition security and resilience.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 25


American farmers this year are likely to harvest the lowest number of acres in
this century, the United States Agriculture Department said Friday. In a monthly
report, the department said that record acreage left unplanted under Government
programs and high crop failure this year because of the summer drought resulted
in the record low acreage. Harvested cropland in the United States was estimated
at about 284 million acres, down 9 million from last year and 67 million acres
below the 1981 peak.

Missionary Oblates, land trust reach agreement

The Great Rivers Land Trust has signed a contract with the Missionary Oblates of
Mary Immaculates to protect the area from future development.

The Missionary Oblates donated the development rights for a mile-long stretch of
bluff that overlooks the Mississippi River. That donation was used to match a
grant from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, which was used in turn
to match a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The land trust then used the grant money - more than $ 500,000 - to buy other
conservation easements on the Missionary Oblates' property.

Although the Missionary Oblates still have title to the property, they must
participate in a management plan to preserve the land. The agreement will stand
even if the property is sold, said Annie Hoagland, vice president of the land
trust.

"They are able to continue what they have been doing." Hoagland said. "But we've
managed to provide them with an income so they don't get in a crunch and have to
sell off pieces of (their land).

"They give posterity a great gift."

WASPS TRAIN FOR STING OPERATION ON TERRORISTS

SECTION: Post Edition; NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 220 words

HIGHLIGHT: Scientists in the US say trained wasps could one day take the place
of dogs used to detect explosives


A new weapon with a sting in its tail is being developed against terrorists -
the sniffer wasp.

Scientists in the US say trained wasps could one day take the place of dogs used
to detect explosives.

Studies show they also have the potential to uncover hidden drugs, spot cancer
and plant diseases, and even locate buried bodies.

Wasps are better at detecting specific chemical odours than any existing
'electronic nose' and much cheaper than trained dogs, say the researchers.

The insects are contained in a cup-sized device, called a Wasp Hound, capable of
triggering an alarm or flashing light when a target odour is found.

On the face of it, the idea sounds like an April Fool joke. But researchers from
Georgia University and the US Department of Agriculture are perfectly serious.

Dr Glen Rains, a biological engineer from the university in Tifton, Georgia,
said: 'We've now developed a prototype device that puts the idea of using
chemical-sensing wasps into a practical framework, and its possibilities are
astounding.'

He believes a commercial Wasp Hound could be ready in five to ten years.

For their latest study, the researchers used Microplitis croceipes, a species of
tiny parasitic wasp that can be trained to detect certain odours by associating
them with a food reward.

DATELINE: Washington


US Department of Agriculture, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

The United States Department of Agriculture and the Brazil Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock and Food made a joint statement today:

The United States and Brazil are two of the world's largest agricultural
producers and exporters. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) and Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food
Supply (MAPA) have collaborated on many agriculture issues and currently have
some 100 agricultural cooperative activities. As global leaders in the use of
innovative agricultural production technologies, both countries share a keen
interest in exploring further agricultural cooperation.

Both Brazil and the United States maintain a strong commitment to science-based
rulemaking. USDA and MAPA recently agreed to a path forward to amend rules that
currently limit bilateral beef trade. Bilateral trade of all beef and beef
products could occur once each exporting country meets the importing country's
equivalence and technical requirements for animal health and food safety.

Drought Damage Estimated

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

SECTION: Section D; Page 1, Column 6; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1040 words


The United States Department of Agriculture's special crop report, due July 12,
is expected to show that drought damage to the nation's crops is at least as bad
as the commodity markets have anticipated, a leading agribusiness consultant has
said.

After the recent surge in prices of major crops and uncommon volatility in the
commodities markets, the Agriculture Department decided to issue the special
report instead of waiting until early August to forecast yields, as it normally
does.

The markets have experienced several sharp swings in the prices of corn, wheat
and soybeans with each turn in the weather because of conflicting estimates of
the damage caused by the worst drought since the dust bowl days of the early
1930's.

Normal Weather Unlikely

John A. Schnittker, a leading agribusiness consultant, expects that the
Government report will show that unless there is a dramatic return to normal
weather this week - which few forecasters consider likely - the estimate of the
season's output of corn will shrink to 5.4 billion bushels, from 7.25 billion
last year. At the lower level, the market's current price of $3.42 per bushel
largely takes into account the damage already done.

Mr. Schnittker, a former Agriculture Department official, said he bases his
estimate on research by his Washington-based organization, John A. Schnittker
Associates, which polls farmers as the Agriculture Department does.

The Government's estimate of wheat and soybean production this year is also
eagerly awaited. Mr. Schnittker believes the agency will forecast that the total
wheat crop will come in at 1.8 billion bushels, compared with last year's normal
crop of 2.15 billion bushels.

Decline in Soybeans

As for soybeans, Mr. Schnittker figures the agency will confirm the market's
expectation that the crop will be 1.6 billion bushels, down from 1.9 billion
bushels last year.

Mr. Schnittker's corn and wheat crop estimates are in line with those of Richard
J. Feltes, research director of Refco Inc., a leading commodities trading firm.
Mr. Feltes last week also estimated that the soybean crop would be 1.52 billion
bushels, somewhat less than Mr. Schnittker's 1.6 billion bushel estimate.

Another organization that polls farmers, Conrad Leslie Analytical Organization
in Chicago, said his results from a poll of 500 farmers in the grain belt were
not yet complete.

Market Reflects the Damage

While the present prices in the commodities markets largely reflect Mr.
Schnittker's estimate of the damage, the volatility is likely to continue in
anticipation of and reaction to the Government estimate. Traders will also
attempt to fine tune their positions for variables like export sales and changes
in domestic consumption brought about by the higher prices.

Such variables will include the augmentation of the corn crop, used largely as
livestock feed, by the 4.1 billion bushels, of 56 pounds each, held in surplus
from past harvests. This should be sufficient to meet domestic needs, especially
as soaring feed prices are forcing many cattle, hog and poultry raisers to cut
back animal populations.

The supply should also be enough to meet export needs, which are expected to
decline as rising prices force foreign buyers to either reduce purchases or seek
other suppliers. About one-fifth of the corn crop is usually exported, compared
with half the wheat and two-thirds of the soybeans and byproducts produced each
year.

Impact on Food Prices

''We believe the drought will have its greatest and most long-lasting impact on
wheat and soybeans,'' Mr. Schnittker continued. ''As a result, ingredient costs
on flour, baked goods, pasta, margarine and vegetable oils generally have and
will continue to rise for a long time. But if the Government continues to
release more of the corn reserves, cost increases for corn users may yet be
reduced - if we get some good rains soon.''

Last week, more farmers who had pawned corn from past harvests with the
Government redeemed their grain. But with corn prices now about 200 percent
above the loan rate and rising, few farmers will be willing to part with their
crops.

The Reagan Administration, meanwhile, has been reluctant to end its Export
Enhancement Program, which subsidizes exports of farm crops by rewarding
exporters with surplus grain. One reason is that farm exports have prevented the
nation's trade deficit from soaring at an even greater rate. Another reason is
that the Government wants to protect its overseas export markets for grain and
oilseeds and byproducts.

Wheat for Pasta

As for nation's second largest crop, wheat, the harvest of winter wheat is now
drawing to a close. Winter wheat, which is sown in the fall, accounts for 75
percent of the supply of this bread grain and in many areas the harvest has
benefited from the dry weather. But spring-sown wheat, particularly the high
quality, protein-rich durum variety used for pasta, has been severely damaged by
the drought. Even though Mr. Schnittker's estimate of wheat production is 350
million bushels less than last year's 2.15 billion bushels, there is a surplus
from previous harvests of 1.23 million bushels.

The soybean situation is more critical because there is not as much surplus.
There, the carryover is only 275 million bushels, and this year's crop is
expected to be down 300 million bushels from last year's. Moreover, the drought
is expected to prevent many farmers from putting in a soybean crop after
harvesting their grain, which has been a normal practice in many areas because
the beans may be planted as late as mid-July.

Soybeans are also commonly sown in the Corn Belt as a rotation crop in order to
replenish the soil. In recent years soybeans have been found to thrive in
worn-out cotton fields in the Deep South.

Other Factors for Prices

In any case, the near doubling of grain and soybean prices since the drought
began in the early spring is not the only reason food costs are expected to rise
later this year and in 1989. Labor, packaging and other overhead costs of the
food industry have soared 25 percent in the first six months, according to
Milling and Baking News, the leading journal of the industry. published in
Merriam, Kan.

Washington: Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture

LENGTH: 703  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Department of State has issued the following news release:

The United States is a founding member of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart
Agriculture. As part of its commitment to promoting climate smart agriculture
around the world, the U.S. government supports the following initiatives:

In the United States, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) manages seven
"Climate Hubs" around the country to deliver information to farmers, ranchers
and forest landowners to help them adapt to climate change and weather
variability.
 The Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases, to which the
United States contributes, aims to deepen and broaden mitigation research
through collaboration and data sharing.
 Feed the Future, the U.S. government's global hunger and food security
initiative, focuses on agriculture-led development to spur broad-based economic
growth that can reduce hunger, poverty, and undernutrition. It is helping
mitigate risks of climate change by supporting smallholder farmers in producing
more and better quality foods, improving access to new tools and technologies,
and building resilience while using land, energy, water and other inputs more
efficiently.
 Feed the Future is pairing American ingenuity and expertise with some of the
best and brightest minds across the globe through its 24 Feed the Future
Innovation Labs, a unique network supported by more than 60 top U.S. colleges
and universities along with many partner country research and educational
institutions.
 The United States helped create the Climate and Clean Air Coalition on
Short-Lived Pollutants, housed at the UN Environment Program, which includes an
action-oriented Agriculture Initiative to address methane and black carbon
emissions associated with open agricultural burning, paddy rice production, and
livestock management.
 The U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative provides climate-related assistance
to more than 50 developing countries. Programs like the SERVIR climate data hubs
help developing countries build the critical capacities they need to increase
resilience to changes in climate, to protect lives and livelihoods, and to
promote low-carbon growth and development.

The United States also supports multilateral funds and organizations that
provide dedicated financing to agricultural development in developing countries.

The United States is the largest donor to the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program, which has provided $912 million in grant financing to support
agricultural development in the world's poorest countries. About one-third of
the current portfolio, or roughly $300 million, focuses on climate adaptation
and mitigation activities.
 The United States is also the largest contributor to the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, which finances climate smart agriculture in the
poorest and most vulnerable agricultural communities.
 U.S. support to the international Climate Investment Funds (CIF), including the
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), helps the most vulnerable countries
protect their economies and citizens from the negative effects of climate
change. Agriculture and land management are one of the key sectors supported by
the PPCR. The Forest Investment Program (FIP) is providing more than $600
million for activities to address reducing emissions from deforestation and
degradation - often with significant agriculture components - in Brazil, Burkina
Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Laos, Mexico, and Peru.
 In partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency and a range of private
and non-profit partners, USDA has created a new Food Waste Challenge to
encourage people to find new ways to reduce food loss and waste, to recover
unneeded, wholesome food that can help feed those in need, and to recycle wasted
food as much as possible. Food is the single largest component of municipal
solid waste going to landfills - and those landfills are the third largest
source of methane. By reducing the amount of food we toss into the trash, we can
help reduce these potent greenhouse gas emissions.

USDA Deputy Under Secretary Taylor Leads Women in Agriculture Trade Mission to
Hong Kong and Shanghai

LENGTH: 796  words

DATELINE: New York



 Phoenix: U.S Department of Agriculture, The State of Arizona has issued the
following news release:



 Leaders from seven state departments of agriculture and 23 U.S. agribusinesses
and organizations will accompany Deputy Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign
Agriculture Services Alexis Taylor on a trade mission to Hong Kong and Shanghai
Sept. 7 to Sept. 15 to extend USDA's Women in Agriculture initiative abroad and
expand export opportunities for U.S. food and agricultural products.





 "USDA is committed to building opportunities for women to grow, learn from one
another and lead within their industries," said Taylor. "Women in agriculture
have a powerful story to tell - one of leadership, stewardship and resilience -
from the combine, to the classroom, to the boardroom. This trade mission
provides us an opportunity to discuss the impacts women in the United States and
China are having on agriculture and to share our visions for the next
generation. In addition, I look forward to joining U.S. agricultural leaders as
we seek to enhance our trading opportunities in this region."



 The United States has strong trading relations with both China and Hong Kong.
Last year, China was the second-largest market for U.S. agricultural exports
reaching $23.5 billion. Sustained high demand for bulk commodities such as
soybeans and cotton continues, and demand for high-value food, meat and alcohol
products is surging. Next year, China is projected to return as the United
States' top export market.



 In contrast to China, where more than 70 percent of U.S. exports are bulk
commodities, more than 90 percent of U.S. exports to Hong Kong are high-value,
consumer-oriented products. With a population of more than 7.2 million people
packed into 426 square miles, Hong Kong relies on imports for more than 95
percent of its food supply. It is the United States' seventh-largest market,
with top U.S. exports including tree nuts, beef, poultry and fresh fruit.



 Mission participants come from across the United States and represent a range
of agricultural products and commodities. They will meet with potential
customers and host government representatives, forging relationships and
learning about the market conditions and business environment.

 USDA trade missions open doors and deliver results for U.S. exporters, giving
them the opportunity to gather market intelligence and develop strategies to
start or expand their sales in key markets overseas. For more information, visit
www.fas.usda.gov/topics/trade-missions.



 The past seven years have represented the strongest period in history for U.S.
agricultural exports, with international sales of food and farm products
totaling $911.4 billion between fiscal years 2009 and 2015. In fiscal year 2015,
American farmers and ranchers exported $139.7 billion of food and agricultural
goods to consumers worldwide. Exports are responsible for 20 percent of U.S.
farm income, also driving rural economic activity and supporting more than one
million American jobs.

U.S. lifts curbs on China farm credit

The U.S. Agriculture Department removed restrictions on its US$100-million
credit allocation to China and added fresh fruit to the types of U.S. farm
products that China can purchase on credit. Under terms of the revised credit
allocation, the department lifted the ceiling on the amount of products such as
wheat, cotton  or vegetable oils China can purchase. China, normally a cash
customer of U.S. agricultural products, was granted export credits for the first
time last December as Beijing stepped up imports in an effort to dampen a surge
in consumer food prices.

U.S.-Soviet Grain Talks Planned

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28


For the first time since the curtailment on grain sales to the Soviet Union was
imposed last year, United States and Russian officials will conduct formal talks
next month on new grain sales.

''We will discuss additional sales of grain to the Soviet Union, or additional
needs that they may have,'' Agriculture Secretary John R.  Block said today.

The announcement was made by the Agriculture Department in Washington and by Mr.
Block in London, where he was meeting with British agricultural officials as
part of a two-week European tour.

The formal consultations will take place in London on June 8-9, he said. The
Agriculture Department announced that Seely Lodwick, Under Secretary of
Agriculture, will lead the United States delegation and Boris Gordeev, Deputy
Foreign Trade Minister, will head the Soviet group.

In addition to new grain sales to the Russians this summer under an expiring
1976 agreement, Mr. Block said the consultations would also include ''review of
the world crop situation, crops in the United States and crops in the Soviet
Union.''

He also expressed hope that negotiations could begin soon toward a new long-term
grain agreement with the Soviet Union.

Block Urges Japan Access

SECTION: Section D; Page 17, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 205 words

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 6


The United States is ''unequivocally'' committed to supplying a reliable flow of
farm products to Japan, but Japan must reciprocate by allowing American farmers
''fair access'' to its markets, United States Agriculture Secretary John R.
Block said today.

''The United States respects the responsibility it shares for the food security
of the Japanese people,'' Secretary Block told a luncheon audience at the
Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.

Secretary Block, on a five-day visit, is pushing for Japan to increase its
imports of American lumber, which he said would help the recession- plagued
lumber industry in the United States earn another $1 billion annually.

He called elimination of Japanese tariffs on processed wood products ''a top
priority.''

Mr. Block arrived Tuesday and discussed the United States' desire for an end to
Japanese tariffs on wood products, grapefruit and walnuts in a meeting with the
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister, Shinjiro Yamamura.

Ministry officials said Mr. Yamamura had told Mr. Block that getting support in
Japan for tariff cuts on wood would be ''difficult'' after last April's tough
negotiations on expanded quotas for United States beef and citrus imports.

U.S. to join lobby to cut farm subsidies

BYLINE: Bloomberg News; BLM

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: INTERNATIONAL; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 372 words

DATELINE: Buenos Aires


The United States will join an international farm lobby that includes Canada in
an effort to dismantle some agriculture subsidies at world trade talks later
this year, federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said yesterday.

The United States and a 15-nation farm lobby known as the Cairns Group will be
"on the same side" in the fight against subsidies at World Trade Organization
talks in November, Mr. Vanclief said.

The Cairns Group, which also includes agricultural powerhouses Australia,
Argentina and Brazil, met on the weekend to craft their position ahead of the
WTO negotiations.

The group railed against the $362-billion (U.S.) spent by developed nations on
export subsidies and aid, blaming them for the sharp drop in commodities prices
and the suffering of their insolvent farmers.

"The U.S. has offered to co-operate with the Cairns Group in its pursuit of
far-reaching reform of global trade rules for agriculture," said Australian
Trade Minister Mark Vaile. "We want freer and fairer trade of agriculture."

The backing of the United States is critical to the Cairns Group in its struggle
to pressure the European Union to repeal some subsidies. The EU, which spends
$142-billion a year on aid to farmers, is seen by many nations as having the
most distorting impact on farm markets because its subsidies influence
production.

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman on Saturday stopped short of pledging
that his country would lobby with the Cairns Group, saying the two sides still
need further discussions before there is full agreement.

Mr. Glickman, whose presence elevated the usually low profile of the Cairns
meeting, said the United States wants to see more transparency from wheat and
dairy boards and other so-called state trading enterprises. Canada and
Australia, for example, have wheat boards.

Mr. Glickman did say that the United States is hoping for "substantial
improvement" in market access, export subsidies and the reduction of tariffs --
all goals of the Cairns Group.

The stakes are high if the United States, the EU and the Cairns Group -- likely
to be the three main agriculture forces at the November WTO meeting -- fail to
come up with new policies for the trade of grains, oilseeds and livestock.

RP, US Agriculture agencies seal agreement for food security

BYLINE: By Ira Karen Apanay

LENGTH: 506 words


THE Philippines and the United States Department of Agriculture recently signed
a bilateral agreement in the areas of farm productivity, food security and
sustainable natural resources management.

Agriculture Assistant Secretary Josyline Javelosa, who accompanied Agriculture
Secretary Arthur Yap in President Arroyo's 10-working visit to the United States
, said the Agriculture department and its American counterpart are working on a
program that will have American equipment manufacturers providing earthmoving
equipment to the Philippines for irrigation maintenance.

Javelosa said the farm equipment program was among the project proposals that
Yap had taken up with US Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer right after the
signing of the Framework Agreement on Cooperation on Agriculture and Related
Fields, during the Washington leg of the presidential trip.

"Secretaries Yap and Schafer met immediately after the President witnessed the
signing ceremony of the cooperation agreement were they discussed areas for
immediate collaboration," Javelosa said.

The RP-US agreement was signed by Yap and Schafer at the Willard
Intercontinental Hotel on behalf of their respective governments and witnessed
by President Gloria Arroyo.

Javelosa said the framework agreement was signed before President Arroyo's
meeting with Schafer, in which "the President highlighted that the US and the
Philippines should prioritize collaboration in the rice sector."

"Secretary Yap discussed the need for an equipment program whereby the US will
provide earthmoving equipment to shift large amounts of earth, excavate and
desilt canals in support of irrigation rehabilitation and operation and
maintenance," she added.

She said that Schafer, a former governor of North Dakota, committed to assist
Yap in meeting these needs by making representations with Caterpillar, John
Deere and Case companies, three of the leading equipment manufacturers in the
US.

Before returning to Manila, Yap said in Washington that the framework agreement
is meant to renew and enhance "bilateral cooperation between the two governments
in the areas of farm productivity, food security, and sustainable natural
resources management through science and technology."

The areas of cooperation under the new Philippine-American pact include, but is
not limited, to the following: sanitary and phytosanitary measures; agricultural
markets and institutional development; rural development; biotechnology and
other applicable production, processing and postharvest technologies; and
agricultural trade and investment facilitation.

"Under the pact, cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary measures can lead to
protocols that would allow Philippine fresh fruits such as mangoes, bananas and
pineapples and fishery products, access to the premium-priced US market," Yap
said.

"Moreover," he said, "sustained support for an agricultural biotechnology
program can help the Philippines benefit from modern agri-biotechnology
applications, a fast-growing market valued at $67 billion per year."

Australian wheat growers enraged

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 11, WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFS

LENGTH: 86 words


  The U.S.'s weekend decision to increase wheat production sharply drew angry
words yesterday from Australian wheat growers. One industry spokesman said
Washington's move was ''vandalism.'' The U.S. Department of Agriculture decided
that only 10% of U.S. wheat acreage will be left idle this year. Last year 27.5%
was left idle. Don McGauchie, chairman of the Grains Council of Australia, said
more production plus U.S. export incentives ''will blast Australia's wheat
growers out of the water.''

Washington: CBP Atlanta Beagle Brigade Intercepts Foreign Plants, Seeds ... and
a Whole Pig

LENGTH: 447  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists and our
"Beagle Brigade" working at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport
(ATL) intercepted foreign plants, propagative seeds, and a whole pig during the
busy Thanksgiving holiday weekend.On Wednesday, CBP Agriculture Detector K-9
"Joey," a Beagle, alerted to the baggage of a traveler from Peru. During a
secondary examination, CBP agriculture specialists discovered an entire roasted
pig in the traveler's baggage. The pig was seized and destroyed.





 Pork and pork products from other continents are prohibited from entry into the
U.S. to prevent the potential introduction of foreign animal diseases such as
Food and Mouth Disease, Classical Swine Fever, and Swine Vesicular Disease.



 On the same day, a traveler arriving from Uzbekistan was found to have fruit
trees, carrots, and cured sausages consisting of horsemeat. The fruit trees
lacked a United States Department of Agriculture import permit and phytosanitary
certificates, while the meat and fresh carrots were seized to prevent the
potential introduction of pests or animal diseases.



 On Friday, CBP Agriculture Detector K-9 "Candie," a Beagle, alerted to baggage
of a traveler from Bulgaria. During a secondary examination, CBP agriculture
specialists discovered fig trees, tulip bulbs, and almond seeds in the baggage,
and seized it for destruction.



 "Our best defense against destructive pests and animal diseases is to prevent
the entry of prohibited agriculture products they use as vectors from entering
the United States," said Carey Davis, CBP Area Port Director for the Port of
Atlanta.  "One measure Customs and Border Protection employs to intercept
prohibited agriculture products is the effective deployment of highly-trained
K-9 units. These seizures at ATL illustrate the tremendous expertise of our
four-legged K-9 partners in protecting the United States' many agriculture
industries."Every fruit, vegetable or food products must be declared to a CBP
agriculture specialist or CBP officer and must be presented for inspection -
regardless of origin.



 CBP Agriculture Specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences and agricultural inspection. On a typical day nationally,
they inspect over 1 million people as well as air and sea cargo imported to the
United States and intercept 4,657 prohibited meat, plant materials or animal
products, including 464 agriculture pests and diseases.

Wartman to raise fair-trade issue

BYLINE: The Leader-Post

SECTION: BUSINESS & AGRICULTURE; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 233 words


Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Mark Wartman says fair trade with the U.S.
will be among the issues he will raise at this week's 16th annual Tri-National
Agricultural Accord meetings in Alberta.

Wartman leaves today for the meetings, which will be attended by Canadian
agriculture ministers, U.S. commissioners and secretaries of agriculture, and
Mexican secretaries of agriculture.

A number of agriculture- and trade-related issues are on the agenda for the four
days of meetings in Banff, including trade-distorting subsidies, anti-dumping
and countervail measures, and plant pesticide and veterinary drug harmonization.

"I will work to ensure that solutions to these concerns are developed and will
continue to emphasize our government's position that trade between our
countries, particularly the United States, must be fair.

"Saskatchewan farmers must be able to get a fair return for what they produce."

Wartman referred to previous trade disputes, such as U.S. challenges over how
the Canadian Wheat Board operates, as trade harassment, and wants to ensure
trade rules are applied fairly by the United States.

Another important issue for Saskatchewan is harmonization of standards in Canada
and United States in the development of pesticides and veterinary drugs.

At present, it can take up to three years longer to get approval in Canada,
giving U.S. companies a considerable advantage, Wartman said.

Mexico worried about P.E.I. spuds' hygiene

BYLINE: Canadian Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 296 words

DATELINE: Ottawa, Ont.


    Mexico wants assurances that seed potatoes from the Maritimes
 are free of a virus that has caused them to be banned from the U.S., an
Agriculture Department spokesman said yesterday.

The seed potatoes must also not be from a field that is within a kilometre of an
infected field, Ben Borrel said.

''We are trying to comply with the Mexican conditions,'' he said.

The department is already trying to convince the U.S. Department of Agriculture
to lift its ban, imposed about two weeks ago.

Canada ships about 8,000 tonnes of seed potatoes to Mexico annually. Some
potatoes have already been shipped and agriculture officials are trying to make
sure they meet the Mexican conditions.

They are shipped by rail and the U.S. doesn't want them rejected at the Mexican
border, leaving the U.S. with a disposal problem.

Subsequent shipments will be checked to make sure they meet the Mexican
conditions, Borrel said.

Canadian and U.S. officials are meeting again this week to review Canada's
system for detecting and eradicating the virus discovered in several fields in
Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick last summer.

The virus poses no threat to humans but U.S. officials fear it could spread from
potato plants to tobacco and tomatoes.

Potatoes destined for processors or grocery stores can enter the U. S. as long
as they have been sprayed with a sprout inhibitor. Seed potatoes are used to
grow new potato plants.

P.E.I. Agriculture Minister Keith Milligan has said he believes the ban was put
in place as a trade barrier and he wants farmers compensated by the federal
government for any losses. He also thinks Canada should retaliate with a similar
embargo on U.S. agricultural products if the ban is not lifted.

Wheat output to fall

BYLINE: United Press International

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 163 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


  Farmers around the world, in a reaction to the global grain glut, will cut
wheat production by 6% this year, grow more feed grains and oilseeds, and trim
rice output, the Agriculture Department said Friday.

Overall, grain and oilseed production was forecast to drop 1.8% to 1.95 billion
metric tons. Oilseeds are crops such as soybeans and peanuts, that produce
vegetable oil.

Huge wheat reductions were forecast in the Soviet Union, which harvested a
near-record crop of 235 million tons last year. Soviet wheat production was
expected to drop 15% while feed grain production dropped 8%. Lower yields were
expected.

The U.S., Canada and Australia also were projected to make large reductions in
wheat production. Brazil was the only major farm country forecast to increase
production - up 53% to 1.7 million tons following freeze damage to the old crop.

Canadian output was projected to drop 18% from last year's record to 26.1
million tons.

LEAFY SPURGE IS RUNNING WILD

SECTION: Section C; Page 3, Column 3; Science Desk

LENGTH: 226 words


Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), a weed that was a pest in several North Central
and Western areas of the United States 25 years ago, has marched across some
3,000,000 acres of range and croplands since that time and now threatens
3,000,000 additional acres, the United States Department of Agriculture reports.

The weed is repugnant to livestock and wild animals. Its groundcovering
abilities and absorption of soil nutrients can cut productivity of other plant
species by from 40 to 70 percent, according to Terry B. Kinney, acting
administrator of the Federal agency's Agricultural Research Service. The spurge
spreads by sending out shoots from roots that can penetrate as deep as three
feet into the soil. If the spread of spurge is not halted, agricultural experts
estimate that it could spread over large areas of Wyoming, Montana and North
Dakota, as well as parts of South Dakota, Nebraska, Idaho and neighboring states
in the next several years.

Dr. Kinney reported that the plant can be controlled on cultivated land by
tillage, modern cultivation practices, crop rotation and some herbicide use. But
without adequate controls on uncultivated rangelands, the weed crowds out forage
plants and takes the land out of use for livestock.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON - The nation's biggest corn growers group urged farmers yesterday to
participate in the U.S. Agriculture Department's buy-back this week of Aventis
SA biotech corn linked to a recall of taco shells. The gene-spliced corn, sold
to farmers as StarLink, has not been approved for use in human food, but traces
of the corn were found last month in Taco Bell brand shells. The discovery of
the corn variety, which may cause allergies for humans who eat it, has triggered
an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and renewed calls by some
lawmakers and consumer groups for a closer look at U.S. biotech food
regulations.

AUSTRALIAN MEAT WILL BE INSPECTED

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section A; Page 18, Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 369 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 25


Agriculture Secretary John R. Block, armed with evidence that Australian horse
meat has been shipped throughout the United States, announced new efforts today
to keep horse and kangaroo meat out of beef imports.

The new steps call for checking meat from nations besides Australia, which ships
more beef to the United States than any other country, and requiring all
exporting nations to test shipments to the United States. The United States
imports about 7 percent of its beef, more than half of that coming from
Australia.

In addition, Mr. Block said, the Australian Government would be required to test
meat before shipment and to keep the meat under its security until it reaches
the United States.

Testing by Agriculture Department officials over the weekend found more beef
containing traces of horse meat that had been shipped to the United States from
a suspect Australian plant.

Kangaroo Meat Also Found

Last week the Australian authorities discovered some kangaroo meat in beef
shipments destined for the United States, Mr. Block said, raising ''the
possibility that kangaroo meat, as well as horse meat, may have been illicitly
imported in the past.''

Horse meat labeled as beef from Australia was first discovered at a San Diego
processing plant that supplies Jack-in-the-Box fast food restaurants. Since
then, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said, officials have found
that mislabeled meat has been shipped to other processors in the United States.

The spokesman, John McClung, declined to release the names of the processing
companies, but he said officials were ''pretty certain'' that Americans had
eaten meat shipped from Profreeze of Richmond, Victoria, the suspect Australian
plant.

Since last Jan. 1, about 815,000 pounds of boneless beef, primarily for
hamburgers, has been imported into the United States from Profreeze. Of that,
the Department of Agriculture has found and embargoed 270,000 pounds of boxed
unprocessed boneless beef and 275,000 pounds of patties and ground meat, all of
which has been found to contain some horse meat.

U.S. AND MEXICO TO EXPAND COOPERATION ON AGRICULTURE

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section A; Page 12, Column 3; Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 362 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18


The United States and Mexico have signed an agreement to expand their
cooperation in the science and technology of agriculture and natural resources.

The agreement, reached Dec. 5 in talks on farm issues, commits the two countries
to work together on tropical agriculture, crop production forecasting, animal
health, soil conservation, seeds, forestry, pest control and nutrition.

The agreement was signed by Agriculture Secretary John R. Block of the United
States and Horacio Garcia Aguilar, Mexico's Minister of Agriculture and Water
Resources.

Ambassador in Delegation

The six-member Mexican delegation also included Jorge Espinosa de los Reyes, the
Mexican Ambassador to the United States.

In a statement made public by Mr. Block's office, the Secretary said the two
nations would exchange agricultural information, organize study tours for
scientists and specialists and arrange joint seminars and conferences. The
efforts will involve scientific, academic and business figures, as well as
Government officials.

The two nations also recently signed an agreement on collection and exchange of
plant germ plasm.

In discussions on other topics, the Americans assured Mexico it could use some
of a $400 million agricultural credit allocation for purchase of dairy cattle
and seeds, two areas about which Mexico was in doubt, an American spokesman
said.

Concern About Disease

Because Mexico buys fertile eggs and live chicks from the United States, Mexican
officials expressed concern about the deadly avian influenza outbreak in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Americans assured them that they would be kept
informed of the status of the outbreak.

Mexicans also expressed concern that a forthcoming American ban on a pesticide,
ethylene dibromide, or EDB, would interfere with their shipments of agricultural
products to the United States.

The United States is requiring Mexico and several other nations to improve their
meat inspection by Jan. 1 to be allowed to ship meat to the United States. The
Mexicans said they are working on improvements.

The officials also discussed agricultural trade between the two nations.

Drought takes the heat off agriculture trade war

BYLINE: EDWARD GREENSPON; GAM

LENGTH: 637 words

DATELINE: Geneva SWITZERLAND


BY  EDWARD GREENSPON
 Globe and Mail Correspondent
  GENEVA
  Pressure to resolve the world trade war in agriculture has subsided in
the aftermath of last summer's drought in North America, a senior European
trade official says.
   'The urgency in agriculture is gone,' the official, speaking on
condition he not be named, said in an interview.

Last summer's drought, he explained, reduced food stockpiles and raised
the prices farmers get for their produce. Therefore, the levels of
government support required to keep farming afloat will fall, regardless
of peace breaking out in agricultural trade.

'Once you are no longer under those immediate difficulties, somehow  the urgency
diminishes,' the European negotiator said.

His comments come as trade ministers from 105 countries prepare to
gather in Montreal to review progress in establishing new rules for world
trade.

Agriculture has been at the top of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade negotiations, which are halfway through their four-year schedule.

While the European Community now appears to be soft-pedalling the
question of farm subsidies, others warn that a failure to make progress on
agriculture in Montreal could poison the entire trade round.

'While it's true to say that the pressure for an agreement has  subsided a
little, it's very little,' said Hugh Corbet, director of the  London-based Trade
Policy Research Centre. 'It's nothing compared to the  pressures to do
something.'     The European Community is 'always looking for some reason not to
do  something about agriculture,' he charged.

Europe and the United States have been locked in an esclating
agricultural subsidy war for most of the 1980s. As costs mounted earlier
in the past year, trade analysts sensed the political will was emerging to
tackle the problem.

The two protagonists couldn't reach a compromise, however, over their
different approaches. The United States insists on the elimination of all
farm subsidies over the next 10 years while Europe wants to concentrate
merely on preventing further escalation.

U.S. negotiators think that freezing or rolling back subsidies in the
short-term, without a longer term commitment, will only take the heat off
the Europeans to liberalize farm trade once and for all.

According to the EC official, political resistance within the 12-nation
community is mounting to the modest steps already implemented to hold down
farm payments. The EC has far more smaller farmers than the United States
and they tend to exercise inordinate political clout.

If the United States doesn't give ground in Montreal on a short-term
ceasefire, certain community members are bound to become even more
hawkish, he said. 'Political pressure internally will become
unbearable.'
   As well, he added that a number of developing countries also are
reassessing the wisdom of a market-based system for agriculture after
seeing world food stocks fall to dangerous levels.

'You are starting to hear around here that perhaps you might need some
different rules than those for car plants.'     The continuing impasse over
agriculture was laid bare last week when  the 14 negotiating groups - covering
everything from agriculture to  intellectual property - submitted progress
reports in advance of the  Montreal meeting.

The agricultural group could only cobble together a barebones
recitation of general principles, running just over one page. In contrast,
the group looking at improving the GATT's dispute mechanisms handed in a
17-page paper.

Many analysts fear that a possible blowout in Montreal over agriculture
could lead to gridlock in unrelated trade areas. Some Latin American
countries, for instance, are dragging their feet on writing new rules to
regulate trade in service industries because they first want the United
States and EC to show movement on agriculture, Mr. Corbet said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics

Service (NASS) on Friday released the final 2012 Census of Agriculture results
sharing a wide-range of information about what agricultural products were raised
in the United States in 2012, and where, how and by whom they were grown. The
data, which is reported at the national, state and county level, will help
farmers, ranchers, local officials, agribusiness and others make decisions for
the future.

"The 2012 Census of Agriculture provides a wide range of demographic, economic,
land, and crop and livestock production information as well as first time or
expanded data," said Rhonda Brandt, Wyoming State Statistician. "Many of these
data about Wyoming and our counties are only collected and reported as part of
the every-five-year census."

The 2012 Census of Agriculture data show the following key trends for Wyoming.

Wyoming was one of only six states in the entire United States to increase in
both number of farms, 11,736 farms, and land in farms, 30.4 million acres
between 2007 to 2012.

The largest increases in the number of farms occurred in Laramie, Campbell, and
Sheridan Counties.

At 52%, cattle ranches were the largest type of farm in Wyoming, but there were
also 51 farms that grew potatoes, 43 fruit orchards, and 15 berry farms in 2012.

In 2012, 768 Wyoming farms had renewable energy systems producing energy on
their farms, of which solar panels and wind turbines were the most prevalent.

Fremont County had the largest number of farms selling their goods directly to
consumers for human consumption, with 101 farms selling $596,000 worth of crop
and livestock products in 2012.

Albany, Campbell, Carbon, Johnson and Teton Counties had 80 percent or more of
farms with Internet access, with DSL and satellite being the most prevalent
services.

SCIENCE WATCH;
A Better Pollinator

SECTION: Section C; Page 3, Column 1; Science Desk

LENGTH: 351 words


The hornfaced bee, a small insect imported from Japan, is helping to increase
fruit yields in United States orchards by pollinating apple, peach, cherry and
plum blossoms more efficiently than the Italian honeybee, the common pollinator
of American orchards and gardens.

Suzanne Batra, a researcher specializing in the study of wild bees, conducted
side-by-side comparisons between honeybees and hornfaced bees four years ago in
an orchard near Hirosaki, Japan.  She found that hornfaced bees pollinated 105
flowers in the time taken by Italian honeybees to pollinate four.

Dr. Batra, an entomologist with the research service of the United States
Department of Agriculture, noticed as well that while honeybees were often
attracted to flowering weeds adjoining the orchards, the hornfaced bees
preferred flowers of the fruit trees.  She also found that the Japanese species
had a very mild, mosquitolike sting and was easier to handle than the honeybee.

Although the Japanese bee, Osmia cornifrons, is most active at the time most
fruit trees bloom, its activity ceases after the spring. As a result, it is not
expected to replace the Italian honeybee, Apis mellifera, which performs its
pollinating functions on many different types of grain and fruit crops of North
America through all the spring and summer months. The hornfaced bee also
produces no honey.

Dr. Batra, who reported her findings at a symposium at the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, noted that the hornfaced bee was a
''perfect pollinator'' for small farms and home gardens. She pointed out that
the hornfaced bee's larvae overwinter in the straw-like stems of common reeds,
or even in cardboard tubes, and require little or no care.

Test colonies have been established in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina and the District of Columbia. The only area where the bees did not
survive was in the Adirondack Mountains, where winter temperatures reached 40
degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

2003, the projections indicate that Brazil will export US$7.5 billion of the
soybean complex, reaching 2004 as the world"s biggest exporter of the product.
On announcing the harvest, Agriculture Minister Robrto Rodrigues said that US
marketing should not exceed US$7 billion this year. In 2002, Brazilian exports
of the soya complex totaled US$6 billion and those of the United States US$7.2
billion.  (Gazeta Mercantil - Translated by James Bruce)

Soviet Grain Purchases

SECTION: Section D; Page 11, Column 6; Financial Desk

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 21


A Soviet grain negotiating team indicated to Agriculture Department officials
today that the 22 million metric tons of corn, wheat and soybeans the United
States has offered to sell them this year would be sufficient. They did not ask
for permission to buy any more than that in the coming 10 months.

The Soviet team was here for the semiannual consultations provided for in the
five-year grain trade agreement the United States signed with the Soviet Union
last year.

Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel G. Amstutz, who was the host for the
two-day meeting, said that the talks had been candid and cordial.

The Agriculture Department has already estimated a smaller than usual Russian
grain harvest and has been expecting the Soviet Union to have to import a record
50 million metric tons of grain this year to sustain expanding milk and meat
production.

Under the agreement, the Soviet Union is obligated to buy annually a minimum of
9 million metric tons of wheat, corn, and soybeans and a maximum of 12 million
tons from United States grain dealers. If the Russians want to buy more than the
maximum, they must ask the Agriculture Department for permission.

In the first two months of the current agreement year, the Russians have already
purchased and shipped 3.4 million tons of United States wheat and 8.1 million
tons of corn, Mr. Amstutz said.

Fair trade tops agenda for Wartman

DATELINE: REGINA


REGINA -- Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Mark Wartman says fair trade with
the U.S. will be among the issues he will raise at this week's 16th annual
Tri-National Agricultural Accord meetings in Alberta.

Wartman leaves today for the meetings, which will be attended by Canadian
agriculture ministers, U.S. commissioners and secretaries of agriculture and
Mexican secretaries of agriculture.

A number of agriculture- and traderelated issues are on the agenda for the four
days of meetings in Banff, including trade-distorting subsidies, anti-dumping
and countervail measures, and plant pesticide and veterinary drug harmonization.

"I will work to ensure that solutions to these concerns are developed and will
continue to emphasize our government's position that trade between our
countries, particularly the United States, must be fair.

Saskatchewan farmers must be able to get a fair return for what they produce."
Wartman referred to previous trade disputes, such as U.S. challenges over how
the Canadian Wheat Board operates, as trade harassment, and wants to ensure
trade rules are applied fairly by the United States.

Another important issue for Saskatchewan is harmonization of standards in Canada
and United States in the development of pesticides and veterinary drugs.

At present, it can take up to three years longer to get approval in Canada,
giving U.S. companies a considerable advantage, Wartman said.

Offi cials will be discussing issues that affect billions of dollars in
agriculture and agri-food sales between the three countries. Saskatchewan
agriculturalrelated exports to the U.S. exceeded $850 million in 2005, while
sales to Mexico totalled more than $263 million.

A year ago, when accord participants met in California, Wartman's goal was to
lessen barriers to the fl ow of cattle into the United States. He said those
meetings proved benefi cial in easing border restrictions on cattle.

US MEAT EXPORTERS EYE PACIFIC RIM

BYLINE: PAULA L. GREEN; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: EXPORTS, Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 298 words


U.S. exporters of red meat are targeting markets throughout the Pacific Rim with
the help of a $ 9 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The U.S. Meat Export Federation program is using almost 40 percent of the funds
to try to expand the Japanese market for beef, pork and lamb products and about
25 percent to target markets in the China-Pacific region, from South Korea to
Singapore, said Philip Seng, the federation's senior vice president of
nternational programs.

The federation is one of about 50 associations that will receive funds through
the Targeted Export Assistance program, which is run by the department's foreign
agriculture service.

The $ 200 million appropriation for the 1990 fiscal year is the last in the
five-year program, which was authorized under the 1985 Farm Bill. The program
was designed to help commodity producers that were facing unfair trade practices
in foreign countries, a department official said.

This year, for example, the American Soybean Association will receive $ 11.5
million and the California Walnut Commission $ 8 million.

Mr. Seng said U.S. meat exporters want to be ready when Japan's meat market
opens up in 1991. "Right now the market is very controlled," he said. ''As
quotas are lifted and the distribution system is simplified, we want to expand."

U.S. red-meat producers ship about $ 1 billion worth of their output, or 70
percent of their exports, to Japan each year, he said. Before the European
Community banned imports of meats treated with hormones, the 12 EC nations
imported about $ 250 million worth of beef, pork and lamb products, he said.

The Denver-based federation represents a broad range of players in the meat
industry, from cattle feeders to members of the packing industry.

Canada defends marketing boards

BYLINE: JENNIFER LEWINGTON; GAM

LENGTH: 596 words

DATELINE: Washington DC


BY  JENNIFER LEWINGTON
 The Globe and Mail
  WASHINGTON
   Canada aims to strengthen protection for its system of marketing boards
in the current global trade talks, Agriculture Minister Donald Mazankowski
has vowed, defending Canadian agricultural practices that the Bush
administration hopes to eliminate.
   'Marketing boards are not trade-distorting. They don't contribute to a
world surplus in agriculture,' he told reporters yesterday after meeting
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter on the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations and a menu of bilateral food irritants.

While the United States wants a global agreement to get rid of all
agricultural subsidies, marketing boards and other forms of domestic
protection, Mr. Mazankowski said Canada wants to 'clarify and
strengthen' the wording of current rules that permit some supply-
management practices.

'We've made it very clear that the supply-managed system is a very  important
component of our agricultural industry,' he said, adding that  new rules could
give 'a better understanding of what is appropriate.'     One U.S. trade
official said Canada 'is the only one arguing for more  protective rules for
agriculture.' He reiterated the ambitious U.S.  agenda to eliminate, or at worst
reduce, the import barriers imposed by  the United States, the European
Community and other agricultural  exporters, including Canada.

Mr. Mazankowski said Canada is not prepared to cut a bilateral deal
with the United States over ice cream and yogurt, one of several bilateral
trade complaints, before settling the agriculture issue more broadly at
the Uruguay Round.

Those negotiations, conducted under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are intended, among other things, to
reduce barriers to agricultural trade.

Canada and the United States impose stiff restrictions against each
other on dairy products, although they use different mechanisms to achieve
the same end.

Recently, GATT ruled against Canada's import restrictions on the dairy
products and the United States has been pushing for a settlement.

Mr. Mazankowski said Canada is 'not prepared to negotiate' on the
basis of the U.S. proposal because 'the access they are asking for is too
much in our view.' U.S. officials, unhappy about Canadian import
restrictions that effectively limit U.S. exporters to 0.13 per cent of the
ice cream market, want full access.

While defending Canada's use of marketing boards, Mr. Mazankowski
criticized U.S. export subsidy programs, especially for grain, that
effectively depress the world market price. He said that 'Canada is
caught in the cross-fire' in an agricultural trade war between the United
States and the European Community in third markets, making it difficult
for Canada to compete.

He said Mr. Yeutter indicated the United States may ease off on its use
of grain export subsidies for budgetary reasons.

Mr. Mazankowski said he is 'encouraged' by signals from the EC that
they may cut back on their export subsidies as well, which could raise
world producer prices a little.

On bilateral trade frictions, many of which involve food products at
the border, the minister said: 'I'm satisified on agricultural issues
that we're going to be able to resolve these issues.' For the moment,
however, the new mechanisms in the bilateral free-trade agreement have
failed to end several longstanding disputes, including Canadian
restrictions on salmon and herring, labelling requirements for imports of
fruit and vegetables, as well as U.S. import curbs on pork and restrictive
rules on meat inspection and products that contain sugar.

Farm-policy challenge will come in budget cuts

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 236 words

DATELINE: Washington,D.C.


  President-elect George Bush will probably continue the aim of President Ronald
Reagan to reduce federal involvement in agriculture, farm policy experts say.

But he also is likely to put his own stamp on the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, and a stronger Democratic Congress is expected to force compromises
that could increase the government's role in supporting farm prices.

''I think the Bush administration will not be inclined to take a hard look at
recent agriculture policy decisions because they were made by friendly hands,''
said agriculture consultant John Schnittker, a former Democratic official of the
USDA.

Under Reagan, the government reduced price supports to make farm exports more
competitive but retained income assistance for farmers through costly direct
payments.

Bush has endorsed Reagan administration goals at the General Agreement on
Tariffs & Trade to phase out agricultural subsidies worldwide.

Bush's first major domestic challenge in agriculture is likely to come next
spring, when Congress and the White House begin debating ways to make US$30
billion in budget cuts needed to reach deficit-reduction targets. U.S. farm
programs have cost about US$60 billion over the past three years and will be
likely targets in any budget-reduction efforts.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has long said he will step down at the
end of Reagan's term.

SCIENCE WATCH;
Farming by the Slice

SECTION: Section C; Page 6, Column 4; Science Desk

LENGTH: 262 words


A new method of planting crops is being tested by the United States Department
of Agriculture in the hope of helping protect the nation's farmlands against
erosion, a problem considered to be the most serious currently facing American
agriculture. Recent studies indicate that wind and rain annually strip four to
eight tons of topsoil per acre from the country's croplands.

The procedure, performed by a newly-developed implement called a slit planter,
is being tried out in fields near Auburn, Ala., by the Federal agency's
Agriculture Research Services. It uses a knifelike blade to slice the ground
into slit trenches 15 inches deep, but only one-sixteenth of an inch wide at the
bottom. The planter spreads a layer of topsoil over the top of the trench and
the seeds are then planted in the topsoil. The resulting field looks like a
sliced cake, with all slices parallel.

Charles B. Elkins, an Agriculture Department soil scientist who is leader of the
test project, has found that the slicing technique, called slit planting, works
best in hardpan soils. There it lets the roots of such crops as soybeans,
sunflowers, okra and peanuts penetrate the firmly packed soil to find nutrients
and water in the subsoil. At the same time, the slicing leaves the topsoil and
its crop residues in place to act as anchors against the ravages of wind and
rain.  Dr. Elkins is now working with the research agency's agricultural
engineers to develop the slit-planting farm implement so it can be mass-
produced for use in areas where it would prove to be most advantageous.

Farming rebounds after drought;
Off The Charts

BYLINE: BY FLOYD NORRIS

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 492 words


Agriculture is a small part of the United States economy, but last year it was
the best part.

The output of the agriculture sector grew 16.4 percent after inflation last
year, the fastest rise for the sector since at least 1998 and far faster than
any other part of the economy. The United States gross domestic product grew
just 1.8 percent, while the second-fastest-growing sector, the information
industry, rose 3.2 percent.

On June 11, the government released its estimates of state economic growth in
2013. North Dakota led the pack with a growth rate of 9.7 percent. Alaska was
the only state whose economy declined, shrinking by 2.1 percent, largely because
of falling oil production.

The economy of the District of Columbia also declined, but that was because of
cuts in government spending.

North Dakota benefited from its rising production of shale oil, but it was also
helped by the fact that its agriculture sector amounts to 12.9 percent of the
state's economy, more than that of any other state except South Dakota.

By contrast, agriculture accounted for just 1.6 percent of United States overall
output in 2013. But that was the largest share in recent years, up from a recent
low of 0.9 percent in 2006. The agriculture sector includes forestry, fishing
and hunting as well as farming, but farming is much larger than the other
categories.

Last year, the government changed the way it calculated G.D.P. figures,
including counting research and development spending as investments rather than
as consumption. It revised historic figures only back to 1997, so earlier years'
output and growth figures for agriculture are not comparable.

Mitch Morehart,  an economist with the Agriculture Department, said the strong
growth in agriculture reflected a recovery in production for some crops after a
drought in 2012, as well as strong production and rising prices for livestock.

This year, he said, it appeared that agriculture was not doing nearly as well.

Over all, the economies of the 10 states that are most dependent on agriculture
grew at an average annual rate of 3.4 percent in 2013, while the 10 states that
are least dependent on the farm economy grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent.

California is by far the largest agricultural producer, accounting for $46.7
billion, or 17 percent of the total national agricultural output of $269.1
billion. But the state is so large that agriculture makes up only 2.1 percent of
its output, less than 16 other states. Iowa, which ranks second in dollar value,
at $16.1 billion, depends on agriculture for almost 10 percent of its total
economic output.

The 2013 surge in agriculture ended a string of three years in which that sector
did not do as well as the overall United States economy. But since 1998,
agriculture outperformed the rest of the economy in nine of the 15 years.

During that stretch, agriculture grew at an annual rate of 4 percent, double the
2 percent average for the national economy.

Canada, U.S. almost eye-to-eye on spuds Dispute has roots in potato crop failure
in Maine

BYLINE: CP

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E8

LENGTH: 342 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


   OTTAWA (CP) - Canadian agriculture officials are claiming some progress after
day-long meetings with their American counterparts at a potato summit here
yesterday.

While border checks will continue on Canadian spuds entering the United States,
there are signs the protectionist measures may soon be dropped, said a senior
trade official with the agriculture department.

"All we can report is that we have a much better idea of where both countries
stand," said Mike Gifford, the department's acting assistant deputy minister for
marketing.

"We've sorted out - cleared the air - on a number of issues."

The dispute has its roots in last year's potato crop failure in Maine. U.S.
producers were upset when potato growers in New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island moved to take advantage of the market shortage.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture responded by stepping up inspection of
Canadian potatoes and rejecting truckloads of Canadian spuds.

Two weeks ago, Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale countered with a strategy of
his own. He added more Canadian inspectors of U.S. spuds to ensure the Americans
were being fair in their treatment of Canadian exports.

"We have every confidence in the quality of Canadian potatoes," Goodale said at
the time.

The minister said he's encouraged because the number of border crossings with
checks has dropped to just one - between Woodstock, N.B. and Houlton, Me. - from
four or five.

"We don't know if they'll continue now. If they terminate their guys, we'll
terminate ours."

An aide said Goodale had no comment on yesterday's talks.

The United States exports more potatoes and horticultural products to Canada
than it imports. In 1994, Canada shipped 179,000 tonnes of table potatoes to the
United States while importing 253,000 tonnes of U.S. spuds.

Gifford said talks between the two countries will likely continue next week by
telephone.

He said a number of other topics, including trade in sugar, grain and a new U.S.
farm bill, will also continue to be discussed.

Canada said to be cheating

BYLINE: Kelly McParland

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 302 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


A group of 25 congressmen has accused Canada of cheating on wheat exports and
urged the Department of Agriculture to retaliate.

In a toughly worded letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espey, the group
urged subsidies be used to help U.S. grain exports compete.

It attacked the Canadian Wheat Board and accused Canada of ''hypocritically''
masquerading as a free trader.

The letter comes at a time when the administration is under pressure to widen
use of the Export Enhancement Program, which allows use of subsidies to help
U.S. grain compete in export markets.

The group is led by Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, who is chairman of
the House subcommittee of general farm commodities. It includes 14 Democrats and
11 Republicans. They are upset at Canadian inroads into foreign markets,
particularly Mexico. Canada's share of Mexico's wheat market has grown to 66%,
the letter says, while the U.S. share has fallen to 14% from 75%.

''Over the last seven years, as the Department of Agriculture has used
(subsidies) against the European Community to counter its unfair trading
policies, similarly damaging policies emanating from Canada went unchecked,'' it
says. ''As a result, U.S. wheat producers lost significant export market share
to Canada.''

The Canadian Wheat Board, it says, ''routinely . . . undercuts U.S. and world
wheat prices to make inroads into traditional U.S. markets.''

A Canadian Embassy official rejected the charges and said it's not Canada that
is responsible for forcing down wheat prices around the world, but the European
Community and the U.S. ''We are often caught in the middle of these things.''

He said use of subsidies against Canadian wheat ''would be in direct violation
of their obligations under the free trade agreement.''

Farm subsidies   in Japan found   world's highest

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 349 words

DATELINE: Washington DC


Reuter WASHINGTON
  Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and dairy
farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers, a controversial
study of farm subsidies shows.

The study was carried out by the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development . It has not been released by the OECD
because of objections from some countries, but results were provided to
Reuter by officials of several countries on condition they not be
identified.

In the study, the OECD calculates the level of farm subsidies for the
years 1979-81, using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent,
or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage of the value of
their products.

The study has generated controversy because some countries with high
subsidy levels prefer not to highlight that fact, officials familiar with
the study said. Domestic farm support programs are seen by many analysts
as a major cause of the current problems in world agriculture.

For dairy products, the PSE for Japan was 83.3 per cent, the European
Community 68.8 per cent and the United States 48.2 per cent.

For wheat, Japan averaged 95.8 per cent, the EC 28.1 per cent and the
United States 17.2 per cent. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 per cent, compared
with 13.6 per cent for the EC and 5.4 per cent for the United States.

The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries, such
as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but in most cases the results were
much lower than for the United States, the EC and Japan, the sources said.

The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently
published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD
results and update them to 1982-84.

In some cases, the results were substantially different from the
OECD's, in part because farm policies had changed markedly by 1982-84 from
the OECD base period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.

Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to
the OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much
more relevant measure of the current world farm situation.

E.E.C. Farm Policy Faulted;
E.E.C. Farm Policy Faulted

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 16, Column 2; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 244 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16


Agriculture Secretary John R. Block said today that it was as a result of the
European Economic Community's farm-subsidy policy that the United States
government will have to make payments of $400 million to wheat farmers this
year.

Mr. Block also assured the Foreign Agriculture Policy Subcommittee of the
Senate's Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee that the situation in
Poland would not result in a trade embargo involving only United States
agricultural products.

''The agriculture community can rest easily, to the extent that we are not going
to be the sacrifical lamb; we're not going to be singled out,'' he said.

In reporting to the subcommittee on his recent trade talks with European
leaders, Mr. Block said the high subsidies provided farmers in European nations
had led to a doubling of European grain for export.

He said 7 million metric tons of extra wheat put on the global market had sent
the world price down by 50 cents a bushel, forcing it below the level that
requires Federal income-protection payments to American farmers.

''Although we'd asked them to do something,'' Mr. Block told the subcommittee,
''almost nothing has been done. There's been no progress.''

In fact, Mr. Block said, the trade talks last weekend left him with the
impression that the Common Market's attitude on subsidization of exports is one
of continuing the subsidies.

Errol Woman Convicted Of Making False Statements To The U.S. Department Of
Agriculture

LENGTH: 327  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office for the United States Attorneys, District of New Hampshire
has issued the following news release:



   United States Attorney Emily Gray Rice announced that on January 26, 2017, a
jury found Suzanne Brown, age 51, of Errol, New Hampshire, guilty of twelve
counts of making a material false statement to a federal agency in violation of
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001(a)(2), after a five-day trial in the
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.









             The trial began on Wednesday, January 18, 2017 and ended with the
jury's verdict on January 26, 2017. The guilty verdict means that the jury found
that on twelve occasions Brown made false statements and representations in
documents submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA").
Brown, acting as Executive Director of the New Hampshire Institute of
Agriculture and Forestry ("NHIAF"), submitted documents certifying that NHIAF
had paid thousands of dollars to employees for services rendered. These
statements were made in order to draw down funds from a USDA Rural Business
Enterprise Grant. The statements were false because NHIAF had not paid the
employees for their services. In nine of the twelve submissions to the USDA,
Brown created fraudulent invoices purportedly prepared by one or more employees
outlining the services they performed and money they were owed.







             Brown's sentencing before United States District Court Chief Judge
Joseph N. LaPlante is scheduled for May 11, 2017.







             The case was investigated by the United States Department of
Agriculture Office of Inspector General and was prosecuted by Assistant United
States Attorneys Seth Aframe and Georgiana Konesky. Former Assistant United
States Attorney Nick Abramson previously was involved in the matter.

United States reclaims No. 1 spot as biggest ag exporter in world

BUFFALO, N.Y.   U.S. agricultural exports will hit an all-time record of $139.5
billion in fiscal year 2013, making the United States the No. 1 agricultural
exporter in the world.

An economist at the United States Department of Agriculture's Foreign
Agricultural Service presented this as well as other assessments of global
agriculture at the 15th annual Agriculture Media Summit Newsmaker Session held
August 3-7. The United States was the top agricultural exporter in 2011 but
slipped to second in 2012, behind Brazil, due to the drought last year, which
affected many crops.

Drought Cutting U.S. Grain Crop 31% This Year

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1106 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11


In the gloomiest assessment yet of damage wrought by the drought, the
Agriculture Department said today that the United States grain harvest this year
would be 31 percent lower than last year. The harvest, estimated at 192 million
metric tons, would be the smallest since 1970.

Hours before the estimate was issued, President Reagan signed legislation to
provide billions of dollars to farmers and agricultural businesses in nearly
2,200 counties that have lost crops and income because of the drought.

Both developments underscore that the 1988 drought is becoming the costliest in
American history. The drought is also having important political implications in
the United States and in Europe, where efforts to change expensive farm policies
have lost steam.

Corn and Soybean Figures

The Agriculture Department estimated that this nation's corn harvest might total
no more than 4.47 billion bushels, down 2.6 billion bushels from last year. The
soybean harvest is not expected to exceed 1.47 billion bushels, down 430
million. The estimates reflect field conditions of Aug. 1 and are sharply lower
than those made on July 1.

In today's commodity trading, before the report was released, grain and soybean
prices fell. Analysts predicted that prices of corn and soybeans would rise
sharply Friday. ''The drought has caused a disastrous reduction in crops,'' said
Ewen M. Wilson, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Economics. ''Across the
northern Great Plains the crop has failed. On a national basis, it's a massive
reduction.''

The loss in corn, at current prices, amounts to nearly $7.4 billion. The loss in
soybeans totals $3.7 billion. Billions of dollars have also been lost in spring
wheat, vegetables, fruits, hay, livestock and other farm products, the
Agriculture Department and private economists have estimated.

Mr. Wilson said the latest estimates could significantly raise the cost of the
legislation that became law today. The Agriculture Department estimated last
week that the package, which will pay farmers up to $100,000 for crop losses
caused by the drought, would cost $3.9 billion. The Congressional Budget Office
estimated today that it would be closer to $5.1 billion.

The legislation is to be paid for with funds that have been saved in the
Government's farm income support programs. Higher commodity prices have reduced
payments. The savings, according to the latest Agriculture Department estimate,
could total $6 billion next year.

Political Impact Abroad

But in cutting surpluses, raising commodity prices and reducing the budget for
income support programs, the drought is having political effects. The United
States and the European Community have been meeting for months in Geneva to
develop a program to alter policies of subsidizing crop exports and farm
incomes. President Reagan has often spoken forcefully about his desire for a
worldwide end to farm subsidies.

The budget for farm programs soared to $26 billion in 1986, and similar costs
have been borne by European nations as well. Mr. Wilson said today, though, that
the drought was dissipating pressure in the United States and in Europe to
change farm policies.

Daniel G. Amstutz, chief farm negotiator for the United States trade
representative, said, ''The drought has taken away the short-term incentives to
negotiate seriously.''

The severity of the drought is also complicating efforts by the Agriculture
Department and the Congressional Budget Office to develop accurate estimates of
the cost of the relief legislation signed today. At a ceremony in the Rose
Garden at the White House, President Reagan called the legislation ''the largest
disaster relief measure in history.''

Legislation Cost Unclear

How much the Government will spend on the legislation - which will pay any
farmer who suffers crop losses of at least 35 percent, up to $100,000 - remains
a mystery, with estimates seeming to change weekly.

''In all,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers
will benefit. The bill expresses a distinctly American tradition, that of
lending a helping hand when misfortune strikes.''

The Agriculture Department's crop report is the clearest sign yet that the cost
of the relief legislation and the amount of losses will be enormous.

Oat production this year is expected to total 206 million bushels, 45 percent
less than in 1987. Barley production is down 45 percent. Spring wheat, which
last year amounted to 542.3 million bushels, has been cut in half. According to
a recent analysis by North Dakota State University, the drought will reduce that
state's economic activity by more than $3 billion in the next year.

Meteorologists Pessimistic

Agriculture Department officials said today that the losses could increase
significantly if the drought continues to be severe, and meteorologists said
there was every indication that hot, dry weather in the northern Great Plains,
the West and the Midwest would persist until the end of August.

The rains that moistened soil in the Midwest and the Great Plains two weeks ago
have all but disappeared, and more than 40 percent of the United States is
considered in severe or extreme drought, according to a report issued yesterday
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Agriculture
Department said the drought had damaged crops in 43 states. It has also taken a
steep toll in Canada.

The increasing losses caused the Agriculture Department to raise its 1989
estimate of food price inflation. Economists said rising commodity prices would
increase consumer food prices by 3 to 5 percent next year.

Tight Grain Stocks Ahead

Other analysts predicted that food price inflation could be even higher. The
reason, they said, is that world stocks of grain next year are going to be the
tightest since the mid-1970's, contributing to further escalation in the prices
of wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley and other crops. The Agriculture Department
said grain stocks in storage next year would total 288 million metric tons, a
63-day supply.

The estimates of sharply tighter grain supplies reflect damage not only in the
United States but also in Canada, China, Argentina and several other countries.
The estimates of world grain stocks essentially confirm those made by private
analysts last week and are worrisome to Agriculture Department officials.

Mr. Wilson said that although stocks are adequate to supply all of the needs in
the United States and around the world, a second year of drought would be
catastrophic.

The Agriculture Department will issue its next crop estimate Sept. 12.

U.S. report predicts drought will slash grain harvests

BYLINE: By Frances Phillips and Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 694 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  The U.S. Agriculture Department predicted yesterday that the drought,
considered the worst in more than half a century, would lead to dramatic
declines in this year's harvests of corn, soybeans and wheat.

The department's monthly crop report estimated U.S. farmers would produce 4.48
billion bushels of corn this year, 37% less than last year.

The soybean crop was forecast at 1.47 billion bushels, 23% smaller than the 1987
harvest and projected to be the lowest since 1976.

The survey estimated that a smaller spring wheat crop would result in total U.S.
wheat production of 1.82 billion bushels this year, a 13% decline from last
year.

However, poor U.S. harvests will not increase exports for the Canadian Wheat
Board. Prairie farm crops have also been decimated by drought.

''Our (marketing) experience will be totally dominated by our available
supplies,'' John Morriss, CWB information director, said in a telephone
interview yesterday.

''There is no question of us filling in because we don't have the product
either.''

In the 1986-87 crop year the U.S. and Canada accounted for 33% and 24%
respectively of world wheat and flour exports.''

EARLY ESTIMATES

The dramatic decline in U.S. grains production is unlikely to push commodity
prices much beyond current levels. ''Those numbers are already factored into the
market,'' Morriss said.

The extent of drought damage in Canada will become clearer when the United Grain
Growers farmers' co-operative issues its Prairie crop report later this month.

Economists are also anxiously awaiting Statistics Canada's crop report due Sept.
2.

Early estimates suggest Prairie wheat farmers will harvest 36% less wheat than
projected and Ontario farms will harvest 22% to 40% less.

Ontario corn producers are looking at yields 30% below expectations.

Meanwhile, the Rome-based United Nations Food & Agriculture Organization said
yesterday in its August outlook the drought will cause world cereal production
to fall for the second consecutive year and cut global stocks to the bare
minimum.

BILL SIGNED

World cereal production is forecast to fall to 1.77 billion metric tons this
year, 13 million below last month's forecast and 24 million below last year's
output.

Earlier yesterday, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed into law a
multi-billion-dollar bill to reduce losses suffered by drought-stricken farmers
and ranchers.

The USDA crop report, based on conditions as of Aug. 1, was the first
comprehensive field survey of the season and the most accurate assessment to
date of the drought.

It confirmed the conviction shared by most analysts that since July, widespread
hot, dry weather has continued to take its toll on major U.S. crops and cut into
projected world grain and soybean stocks.

The prospect of small grain and soybean harvests has important implications for
inflation and trade flows.

Rising grain and soybean prices have pushed up U.S. food prices and contributed
to a modest acceleration in overall inflation.

In a survey released earlier this week by the widely watched Blue Chip Economic
Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., 58 economists mentioned higher U.S. food prices as
the most important factor that could cause inflation to flare up next year.

In the latest report, based on a survey of more than 60,000 farms, the USDA
trimmed its July estimates of corn, soybeans and spring wheat production.

The department estimated the 1988 corn crop would drop to 4.48 billion bushels
from 7.06 billion bushels last year. The July report pegged the 1988 corn crop
at 5.20 billion bushels.

U.S. corn stocks at Aug. 30, 1989, were projected to be 1.58 billion bushels,
down from 4.35 billion bushels estimated to be stockpiled at the end of this
month.

The 1988 soybean crop was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, compared with 1.90
billion bushels in 1987. Last month 1988 soybean production was forecast at 1.65
billion bushels.

Total U.S. wheat production was forecast at 1.82 billion bushels, 284 million
bushels below 1987. In July, the USDA estimated 1988 all-wheat production at 1.8
billion bushels.

HEAVY RAINFALL STYMIES U.S. FARMERS: Wet, wet, wet' in Mississippi

BYLINE: Bob Burgdorfer Reuter

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 618 words

DATELINE: Chicago, IL


Spring planting has been a long, arduous process in the U.S. this year as heavy
rain has kept farmers out of fields from Louisana to Minnesota, but analysts say
it is unlikely to send food and textile prices higher.

''We are wet, wet, wet,'' says Kenneth Hood of Gunnison, Miss., who has 2,000
acres of cotton left to plant. Normally, planting of his 6,500 acres would be
done by now. ''Our soils are so wet we can't get into the fields,'' he says.

The villain is a high-pressure system over the eastern seaboard, which has
forced warm air from the Gulf of Mexico to move north along the Mississippi
River, spawning a parade of thunderstorms, says Peter Leavitt of Weather
Services Corp. in Bedford, Mass.

The late planting shortens the crop's growing season and will hurt production.
Normally, Hood's cotton averages 750 pounds to 800 pounds of cotton an acre.
This year, he will be lucky to get 700 pounds.

Surveys by the U.S. Agriculture Department surveys show 40% of Mississippi
cotton was planted as of Sunday, against 95% by this time last year and a
five-year average of 92%.

''For the most part we are three weeks behind on cotton planting, and about a
month late on rice,'' says Joe Love, the county agriculture extension agent for
Bolivar County, Miss. ''Planting this late means we need a warm October to allow
the (cotton) crop to mature.''

Love says history shows there is a ''seven-in-10 chance'' for a warm October.

The moisture has damaged the soft red winter wheat crops in the South and
southern Midwest. Low yields have been reported in Louisiana and disease is
evident in southern Illinois, crop experts say.

In Iowa, the leading corn-producing state, 70% of the corn has been planted.
That's behind last year's 87% pace and the average of 95%.

Corn and soybean prices have not risen in reaction to the delayed planting, but
cotton prices have shot higher in recent months.

Unless crop losses are severe, consumers are unlikely to be pinched by higher
food and textile prices.

Steve Freed, analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, says prices paid to farmers
account for less than 5% of retail food prices, with the bulk of food costs
linked to labor and transportation.

''It should not have a price impact at all,'' Freed says. He notes that
bountiful crops in the last few years resulted in lower prices paid to the
farmers, but consumer prices went higher.

Clear skies early this week allowed Bob Sienknecht of Dunkerton, Iowa to plant
corn, but more rain late Wednesday forced him to stop.

''I have never planted this late,'' he says of his corn. ''I don't have any
soybeans planted and I'm usually done by now.''

Sienknecht says his farm in east central Iowa has received seven inches of rain
in past two weeks, and some neighbors have reported 10 inches in that time.

Because soils are wet, crops will establish shallow roots. Sienknecht says that
can be a problem if the summer is dry, because the crops will be unable to use
moisture deep in the soil.


Weather Services Corp.'s Leavitt says that may be a real concern this year. The
high-pressure ridge on the east coast has the potential of bringing long periods
of hot, dry weather to the Midwest.

''We feel that the developing ridge will be a persistent feature,'' he says.
''As it grows and moves westward it should bring warm temperatures to the
Midwest and drier weather.''

He estimated a 50-50 chance that the system could produce crop-threatening hot,
dry weather in the Midwest.

''It very well could be severe to crops,'' Leavitt says. He says if his
forecasts are accurate, then hot, dry weather might occur soon and last four to
six weeks.

Canada considering spud war with U.S.

BYLINE: HEATHER SCOFFIELD AND KEVIN COX, With a report from Canadian Press

DATELINE: OTTAWA and HALIFAX


Canada is preparing to retaliate against the United States, government officials
said yesterday after the U.S. administration said it will continue its ban on
PEI potatoes even though they acknowledge that they have no scientific basis for
doing so.

Scientists from both countries have spent the past couple of days sharing data
and samples of potatoes from Prince Edward Island. And both sides agree that
there is no basis on which to continue the two-month-long ban on the province's
main export for fear of spreading the potato wart disease, Agriculture Canada
officials said yesterday.

But the United States has not opened up its border and U.S. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman has told Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief that it will
not even consider doing so until tomorrow.

"It's very evident that this is politically driven. This is totally unacceptable
to us," said Sylvie Millette-Leduc, spokeswoman for Mr. Vanclief.

She said the Canadian government is consulting with the PEI potato industry to
see how it feels about Canada blocking potato imports from the United States, in
retaliation for the American ban.

PEI Agriculture Minister Mitch Murphy is urging the federal government to use
the same kind of sanctions against United States potatoes that have been imposed
on PEI shippers. He said in an interview this week that shipments of potatoes
from areas of the United States where diseases such as golden nematode are
present should not be allowed into Canada if PEI spuds can't be shipped south
due to the potato wart.

Mr. Murphy said that more than 10,000 soil tests have been done that show the
potato wart fungus has been limited to a 0.4 hectare plot of land.

" . . . Now we've asked the federal government to put similar restrictions on
the U.S.," he said.

However, federal government insiders fear that a retaliation could spark a
broader trade war.

U.S. BANS P.E.I.'S SPUDS, PROVINCE SET TO FIGHT BACK: Sudden move endangers most
of the island's business

BYLINE: Barbara MacAndrew with files from Jill Vardy

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

DATELINE: Charlottetown, P.E.I.


A ban on P.E.I. potatoes entering the U.S. could jeopardize up to 70% of the
province's $100-million industry, Agriculture Minister Keith Milligan said
yesterday.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture placed the ban on potato imports because of a
virus affecting some P.E.I. seed potatoes.

As of Wednesday, seed potatoes from P.E.I. and New Brunswick were not being
allowed into the U.S.

Milligan said the provincial government will mount a strong campaign to get the
U.S. ban dropped.

Kevin McKenna, of McKenna Brothers, a potato producer from Cardigan, P.E.I, said
the U.S. ruling was ''straight harrassment.''

He said the decision, which could cost his company several million dollars in
lost sales, was a move by the state of Maine to limit the number of Canadian
potatoes entering the U.S.

McKenna estimates that 50%-70% of the island's potato crop goes to the U.S. each
year.

McKenna said several of his company's trucks are heading back to Cardigan, in
the eastern section of the province, after being turned away at the border.

In Ottawa, Diane Milne, director of plant protection with Agriculture Canada,
said the ban was imposed without any consultation with the Canadian government.

Milne said U.S. officials have agreed to meet their Canadian counterparts next
week to work on a plan to get the border reopened for the potatoes. ''We are
hoping this issue can be resolved quickly,'' she said.

The ban also covers table stock from the Maritimes, Ontario and Quebec.

Paul Farrell, Agriculture Canada's regional director of inspection and plant
health, said some seed potatoes from other parts of Canada are also affected.

Those potatoes are only being allowed into the U.S. if they are accompanied by
certificates stating they are not the progeny of recent P.E.I. stock.

Maine halted all imports of P.E.I. seed potatoes last month because the virus
can damage tobacco crops.

The wider ban comes at a time when potato producers in the two provinces are
putting together seed orders. Farrell said the ban effectively kills those
orders.

He said precautions are also being taken in Canada, but the actions are not as
severe. Seed potatoes are being tested, and only ones that show no sign of the
virus will be planted.

The virus has affected 17 farms since it was discovered on the island about a
month ago.

When Maine announced its ban, the head of the P.E.I. Potato Board accused the
Americans of employing the virus as an excuse to block Canadian imports.

''We're a competitor with Maine and I don't think they really want us to be
selling to U.S. producers,'' George Webster said then.

Agricultural-related jobs on the rise

BYLINE: The Camp Verde Journal staff

LENGTH: 497  words


U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack recently announced a new
report showing tremendous demand for recent college graduates with a degree in
agricultural programs with an estimated 57,900 high-skilled job openings
annually in the food, agriculture, renewable natural resources and environment
fields in the United States.

According to an employment outlook report released by USDA's National Institute
of Food and Agriculture and Purdue University, there is an average of 35,400 new
U.S. graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher in agriculture related fields
-- 22,500 short of the jobs available annually.

"There is incredible opportunity for highly-skilled jobs in agriculture,"
Vilsack said. "Those receiving degrees in agricultural fields can expect to have
ample career opportunities. Not only will those who study agriculture be likely
to get well-paying jobs upon graduation, they will also have the satisfaction of
working in a field that addresses some of the world's most pressing challenges.
These jobs will only become more important as we continue to develop solutions
to feed more than 9 billion people by 2050."

The report projects almost half of the job opportunities will be in management
and business. Another 27 percent will be in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics areas. Jobs in food and biomaterials production will make up 15
percent, and 12 percent of the openings will be in education, communication, and
governmental services.

The report also shows that women make up more than half of the food, agriculture
, renewable natural resources and environment higher education graduates in the
United States.

Other highlights of the report include:

While most employers prefer to hire graduates of food, agriculture, renewable
natural resources and environment programs, graduates from these programs only
fill about 60 percent of the expected annual openings. Even as enrollments in
these programs increase and the job market becomes somewhat more competitive,
good employment opportunities for the next five years are expected.

Growth in job opportunities will be uneven. Employers in some areas will
struggle to find enough graduates to fill jobs. In a few areas, employers will
find an oversupply of job seekers.

Expect to see a strong employment market for e-commerce managers and marketing
agents, ecosystem managers, agricultural science and business educators, crop
advisors and pest control specialists.

Job opportunities in STEM areas are expected to grow. Expect the strongest job
market for plant scientists, food scientists, sustainable biomaterials
specialists, water resources scientists and engineers, precision agriculture
specialists and veterinarians.

Renewable Natural Resources, and the Environment, United States, 2015-2020, is

U.S. likely to raise wheat planting limit

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 3, THE MARKETS; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 211 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  Worried by dwindling supplies, the U.S. government is widely expected to let
farmers plant more wheat for harvest next year to top up reserves and fend off a
food price surge.

The decision would reassure foreign countries like the Soviet Union, China and
Egypt who rely on U.S. wheat to help feed their people and pay lower prices when
wheat bins are brimming.

But wheat trade competitors say the U.S. would be unfairly boosting exports and
throwing a wrench into world trade talks.

American wheat farmers who benefit from federal price supports and income
subsidies must keep idle a certain share of their land as part of a national
effort to keep the country from ending up with too much or little wheat.

The Agriculture Department must announce by June 1 how much land farmers will
have to set aside for the 1990 wheat crop. For the current crop, farmers had to
keep idle one out of every 10 acres.

''Farmers will probably be allowed to plant more acres this year,'' agriculture
consultant Randy Russell said.

While drought has eased its grip on much of the farm belt, it has persisted in
the heart of winter wheat country, severely damaging production prospects and
driving up wheat prices to their highest levels in years.

ST. LOUIS

Check of welfare rolls nets 99 fugitive arrests

By cross-checking welfare rolls and active felony arrest warrants filed with St.
Louis area police departments, officers have been able to arrest 99 fugitive
felons, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General announced
recently.

The nationwide crackdown, known as "Operation Talon," has netted nearly 7,500
arrests. Investigators were able to identify 600 food stamp recipients who were
also fugitive felons. Arrest teams made up of local police officers, deputies,
and federal agents searched St. Louis area streets for them. Among those who
made it to the list were some wanted for homicide, kidnapping and
counterfeiting.

The sweep was made possible by the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. Officers
participating locally included those from the St. Louis Metropolitan Police
Department Fugitive Apprehension Strike Team, St. Louis County police, U.S.
Marshals Service, and sheriff's deputies from St. Charles and Jefferson
Counties. The Missouri Department of Social Services provided the information.

Fire heavily damages two houses

Four people, including two children, escaped injury Wednesday night when a fire
damaged their home in the 4400 block of Penrose Street, near North Newstead
Avenue.

Witnesses said a resident of the neighborhood saw smoke coming from the rear of
a vacant two-story house at 4412 Penrose and alerted the owner of the house next
door, Charles Hennings, who was at a nearby store.

Hennings rushed home and alerted his family, including two grandchildren. They
escaped without injury, fire officials said.

Firefighters said the fire started about 8:40 p.m. in the abandoned house and
quickly spread to the house owned by Hennings.

Firefighters arrived about five minutes later and got the fire under control but
not before both structures were heavily damaged.

Fire Capt. Robert Hennicke said the cause of the fire was under investigation.

CENTREVILLE

Charge is filed in beating

Terry Devin Brooks, 28, of Centreville, was charged Wednesday with aggravated
battery in the beating last week of an autistic man who was left with two broken
legs, a broken arm and head injuries.

The victim, Reginald Brooks, was beaten with an iron pipe near the intersection
of Bond Avenue and 42nd Street. His mother said her son had made some friendly
remarks to a woman who took offense.

BETHALTO

3 are suspected of sexual assault

A 13-year-old girl from Bethalto was sexually assaulted by two men and a
juvenile male last week, Bethalto Police Chief William Hays said Wednesday.

Police presented their case against the three suspects to prosecutors on
Tuesday, Hays said. No charges have been filed. Prosecutors plan to take the
case to a grand jury, possibly as soon as next week.

Hays said officers were called to the scene about 9 p.m. May 1. But he would not
disclose further information. "I won't take a chance about jeopardizing this
case. I won't do that, for the sake of the little girl alone."

Hays said the case was the first sexual assault reported in Bethalto this year.
Madison County State's Attorney William R. Haine declined to comment.

have an extended shelf life of two to three weeks, has been under Agriculture
Department regulation for the last three years.

Calgene, a biotechnology company focused on producing genetically engineered
agricultural products, is the first company to petition the Government to grow
gene-altered plants commercially without Agriculture Department permits. The
company, based in Davis, Calif., plans to begin marketing the Flavr Savr tomato
to consumers next year.

Increasing United States calls for reduction of European trade barriers, mainly
in agriculture, will likely lead to discussion of the issue by leaders of major
industrial nations at the Bonn economic summit conference in May, Daniel
Amstutz, United States Under Secretary of Agriculture, said today.

He told journalists that United States sentiment for a new round of multilateral
trade negotiations is growing.

If Europeans show no willingness to dismantle barriers by the summer, political
pressure could become difficult to resist, he said, even though the Reagan
Administration is against protectionist measures,

Mr. Amstutz said, ''One of the alternatives that could come from lack of
movement ahead on trade negotiations is that unhappiness in our country is at
such a high level that Congress is very likely to pass legislation of a
protectionist nature.''

Off to a difficult start; Getting into agriculture can be challenging,
especially for young and new farmers who increasingly face barriers

BYLINE: Steph Smith, Ontario Farmer

SECTION: SUCCESSION; Pg. A20

LENGTH: 731  words


In Canada and the United States "renewal in agriculture" is becoming a growing
concern.

While the population is aging, so are farming communities. According to
FarmStart, an Ontario-based initiative, there are several factors preventing new
and young farmers from getting into the agricultural sector, such as structural,
economic and practical challenges.

In Canada alone, 50 per cent of farm assets will be transferred within the next
10 years as the population continues to age, with 85 per cent of retiring
farmers not ot having a successor to take over r where they left off.

"We need a federal-provincial farm renewal and new farmer initiative that will
provide funding for programs and services that support a new generation of
farmers and successful farm succession," said Christie Young, executive director
of FarmStart. "New entrant farmers include second career farmers, both young and
old, new Canadians, and young people from farms and non-farm backgrounds."

Young said the initiative she would like to see would be similar to the United
States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Beginning Farmer and Rancher
Development Program.

According to the USDA, its program began with the 2008 Food, Conservation and
Energy Act appropriating "$75 million to

develop and offer education, training, outreach and mentoring programs to
enhance the sustainability of the next generation of farmers." In addition, the
2014 Agriculture Act "provided an additional $20 million per year for 2014
through 2018 " to create further enhancement in the form of grants to academic
institutions, producer groups and community organizations, that provide programs
for new farmers.

Agriculture is on a decline in Canada and the US, with less than 30,000 young
farmers in Canada, and a projected eight per cent decrease in the number of
farmers and ranchers in the US between 2008 and 2018. This means fewer and fewer
farmers will be producing food in the future.

A survey conducted by the National Farmers Union in 2015 concluded the
challenges new and young farmers most commonly face, in addition to access to
educational and informational resources, includes access to land and equipment.

According to a farm report released in 2014 by Remax, farmland in parts of
Canada had either held steady or increased rapidly.

For example, in British Columbia's

Fraser Valley, highs of $63,000 per acre were seen, while in Saskatchewan and
Manitoba prices were seen as low as $950 per acre.

In Ontario, land prices were leveling off, but north of the Greater Toronto
Area, prices hovered around $54,000 per acre for developers looking to purchase
farmland, more than double what farmers were normally paying in other parts of
the province.

Though each area of land provides its own set of advantages and disadvantages,
these inflated land prices are part of what makes purchasing land and farms
difficult for new farmers, especially where a large down payment is required.

"We need to encourage and support [the] new generation of farmers ... and we
need to intervene to support what could be a transformative and dynamic
generational transition," says the FarmStart website. "New farmers bring skills,
connections and passion that can lead to innovation and renewal for our food
economies, agricultural landscape and rural communities."

Some suggestions FarmStart has made regarding support include:

Creating farm policies that support smaller farms: many new/young farmers start
out on small farms.

Creatingaretirement plan for retiring farmers: this would make room for new
farmers by implementing a retirement plan that enables existing farmers to leave
and pass on the farm.

Long-term land tenure and stewardship: investments need to be made over the
long-term in order to care for the land, soil and ecosystems. Local communities
require secure land tenure for those who grow food, and access on affordable
terms for those who want to begin.

"Farm renewal must become a priority if we hope to have vibrant local food
economies, healthy, locally produced food and the long-term stewardship of our
productive soils and valuable ecosystems," says the FarmStart website. "These
will be impossible without a diversifying and growing number of local, viable
and resilient farmers."

Washington: CBP Agriculture Specialists Discover Prohibited Meat Concealed in
Baby Formula Containers at Vancouver Preclearance

 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists seized prohibited
meat products concealed inside baby formula and milk powder containers at the
Vancouver Preclearance Facility on Nov. 13.





 CBP agriculture specialists discovered pork belly meat and pork sausages in
baby formula and milk powder containers.The traveler was referred for an
agriculture inspection and provided a negative verbal declaration when asked if
they had any agriculture products in their luggage. Upon inspection, CBP
agriculture specialists discovered 4.4 pounds of pork belly meat and pork
sausages inside baby formula and milk powder containers.



 &ldquo;This interception demonstrates the benefits of Preclearance locations
where CBP can stop threats or prohibited items prior to reaching the United
States,&rdquo; said Kurry Pastilong, assistant director, Office of Field
Operations, Preclearance. &ldquo;The fact that these items were found even
though they were concealed in an unusual product speaks to the level of detail
and vigilance CBP agriculture specialists display on a daily basis to accomplish
the CBP mission.&rdquo;



 CBP agriculture specialists discovered pork belly meat and pork sausages in
baby formula and milk powder containers.The traveler, who was originating from
China with a final destination of San Francisco, was assessed a penalty and the
prohibited meat was seized and destroyed under CBP supervision.



 CBP Preclearance operations allow for advance inspection of passengers and
special coordination with law enforcement upon arrival in the United States.

MacAulay pitches importance of Canada-U.S. ag trade; $50 billion a year crosses
the border in a relative balance and should be protected

BYLINE: Alex Binkley, Ontario Farmer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A12

LENGTH: 593  words


A mid rumblings of U.S. action against Canadian agrifood imports, Agriculture
Minister Lawrence MacAulay recently spelled out the importance of cross border
trade to American agriculture leaders.

In a speech in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to the annual meeting of the State
Agriculture Leaders and the Legislative Agriculture Chairs Summit, MacAulay said
in 2016, "$50 billion in agriculture and food products crossed our borders. We
are each other's largest trading partner in agriculture and food. Our
agricultural trade is balanced, meaning we export just about as much as we
import."

Nine million American jobs "depend on trade and investment with Canada," he
pointed out. "North America is a marketplace of close to half a billion
consumers for our home-grown North American farm and food products.

The Canada-United States trading partnership has been great for our economies.
And it continues to be.

"We have no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States," MacAulay
stated.

The integration of the North American agrifood systems "makes us more
competitive here in North America and around the world," he added. "And it gives
our consumers access to great food products 365 days a year.

"The fact is, Canada and the United States make great food together. Whether
it's beer or burgers or bacon, chances are you'll find a little bit of Canada
and the United States in every bite."

The minister also reminded the audience that "the United States exports more
agricultural products to Canada than it exports to China. Over half of the
states in the Union count Canada as their No. 1 agricultural export market. The
bottom line is this: if we grow our trade, we grow our economies -together. The
sector creates jobs and we put more money in the pockets of farmers."

MacAulay noted that adding Mexico to the equation made North America even more
important to the global economy. "We export close to a quarter of a trillion
dollars in agri-food and seafood products to the world."

In addition to protests against supply managed products and a new challenge
under consideration over wheat, there is concern that the U.S. Country of Origin
Labelling for meat shipments could be revived even though the World Trade
Organization ruled it violated international trade laws.

MacAulay said a better course of action is continuing to work together to become
more competitive around the world. "That helps all of us. It helps our farmers,
and it helps our people and our economies.

"The long-standing partnership between the United States and Canada continues to
grow and we look forward to building on this partnership with the new
administration.

"Our two countries are also working hard to streamline trade in agriculture and
food through regulatory cooperation," he said. "Through such co-operation, we
can reduce red tape, streamline our regulations and cut costs.

"Our common goal is to keep our agriculture sectors strong and competitive," he
noted. "That's the best way to ensure farmers have a prosperous future. Today,
the need for collaboration is even more important given the growing competition
we face beyond our common shores."

At the same time, the two countries need to work to address their differences,
he said. "The world's demand for food is growing. There's no question that our
nations can respond to that demand, with our high-quality food and world-class
producers. I want our producers to have access to those markets.

"And we must continue to show the world the benefits that trade brings for job
creation and economic growth not only for agriculture,

U.S. bars exporter from subsidy plan

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 3, THE MARKETS; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 384 words

DATELINE: Washington,D.C.


The U.S. Department of Agriculture has suspended a grain-exporting company from
taking part in its export subsidy programs because of alleged links with
fugitive trader Marc Rich, the USDA said yesterday.

Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Stamford, Conn.-based Richco Grain
Ltd. cannot take part in the USDA 's export subsidy sales pending an
investigation into allegations it has links with Rich, against whom government
charges are pending.

''I haven't been personally involved in that (Richco investigation),'' Yeutter
said. ''That's been handled by Undersecretary (Richard) Crowder and
undersecretary (John) Campbell, but I know they have examined the relationships
involving the firm and other people and concluded it would be wise to give the
suspension pending some further investigation.''

Richco officials were unavailable for comment

Marc Rich was reported to have fled to Switzerland five years ago after the
government filed tax evasion, racketeering and other charges against him.

He is on the government's wanted list and the Internal Revenue Service has
offered a reward for information leading to his arrest.

The department's use of Richco to export subsidized commodities came under fire
from Representative Dan Glickman, the Kansas Democrat who heads the House
Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.

Since 1986, Richco is believed to have received millions of dollars in bonuses
from the department in the form of surplus government grain in exchange for
subsidized sales.

Most of its sales, involving mainly barley and wheat, were believed made to
Saudi Arabia, Romania, China and the U.S.S.R.

Glickman said his subcommittee will launch an investigation into the subsidy
program.

''We have to examine how this slipped through the cracks . . . maybe the
administration isn't paying close enough attention to how the bonuses are being
offered,'' he said.

Yeutter said the suspension would be reviewed after the department had conducted
its investigation of the firm.

''Clearly the issue will be reappraised when we see the outcome of some of the
Inspector General investigations and any other information that would be
available,'' he said.

Yeutter said he had no specific examples of irregularities.

Food safety concerns seen in meat sales data

SECTION: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 123 words

DATELINE: PHOENIX


Food safety concerns in Japan were said to be primarily responsible for a sharp
reduction in sales of U.S. beef variety meats to Japan over the last two years,
according to studies conducted by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Despite
Japan's weakened economy and unfavorable currency exchange rates, total beef
shipments have continued to rise. Sales of U.S. beef variety meats to Japan
dropped in 1997 by about 50 percent to 88,826 metric tons from 177, 862 tons in
1996, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture. Keith Belk, animal
scientist at Colorado State University, said Japan's reduced purchases of these
products from the United States, as well as other supplying countries, was due
to food safety concerns.

BLOCK PLANS TRADE POLICY

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 2; Page 35, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 220 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5


Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block said today that he was developing a
policy to deal with all issues of international commodity trading.

''I'm working on a national trade policy, a national agriculture trade policy,
and it's something more important than just talking about an embargo,'' Mr.
Block told the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Foreign Agriculture Policy. He
declined to be specific about the policy or about the officials he has
consulted.

His statements came during subcommittee questions concerning the impact on
farmers of trade sanctions against the Soviet Union because of the Polish
crisis.

Noting the Administration's repeated opposition to a selective grain embargo
such as the one against the Soviet Union in 1980, Mr.  Block said that even an
across-the-board trade ban would affect agriculture more severely than other
industries.

He said that an embargo right now would deny the Soviet Union no more than 5
million metric tons of grain, an amount that could easily be replaced by other
nations.

But he said an embargo would require substantial increases in Government price
support programs for American farmers because of the depressing effect it would
have on prices .

U.S. critics take a jaundiced look at our farm policies

BYLINE: Fred Harrison

SECTION: SECTION 1; Pg. 7, WASHINGTON WEEKLY REPORT

LENGTH: 255 words


  U.S. Department of Agriculture's monthly publication Foreign Agriculture isn't
usually given to ripsnorting investigative journalism, but its September issue
may cause some commotion among Canada's farm policymakers.

In a cover story headed, ''Canada's farm policies erode U.S. trade balance
lead,'' department official Kathryn Ting carefully dissects the network of
government-directed programs which Americans believe constitute barriers to
trade.

The article also blames the strong US$ for the possibility that this year the
Canada-U.S. farm trade balance may move in Canada's favor. ''(But) the decline
in the traditional U.S. agricultural trade surplus also has focused increased
attention on Canadian agricultural and trade policies and the role they play in
the balance of trade.''

The piece then lists a number of the stabilization and supply management
programs which have played a role, pausing occasionally to note that U.S.
policies sometimes also create problems. Then it refers to Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's expected announcement of a new bilateral trade initiative.

''From the U.S. perspective,'' Ting writes, ''negotiations for freer trade in
agriculture. . .would need to address more than tariffs alone. Nontariff issues
such as provincial liquor board marketing restrictions, import quotas under
supply management, restrictions on interprovincial marketing, technical barriers
to trade and domestic subsidies must be addressed before trade liberalization
can be achieved.''

NEW YORK STATE DECLARED FREE OF LEADING LIVESTOCK DISEASE

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

SECTION: Section 1; Part 2; Page 64, Column 3; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 572 words


For the first time since records have been kept, state officials say New York is
free of brucellosis, an infectious animal disease that is the leading health
problem in the livestock industry of the United States.

''We are down to zero infection,'' said Dr. Harold E. Nadler, director of the
division of animal industry of the State Department of Agriculture and Markets.

Dr. Nadler said that the last infected herd of cows had been destroyed last year
in St. Lawrence County and that no further cases had been been reported since
then. If the disease-free status continues until the end of the year, New York
will be certified on Jan. 1 as a brucellosis-free state by the United States
Department of Agriculture.

New York is the only state among the four top dairy states in the nation - the
others are Wisconsin, California and Minnesota - to achieve this status, said J.
Roger Barber, the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets. ''Because of this,
New York dairy cows can be shipped anywhere in the nation and the world without
fear of quarantine,'' he said. ''It is a big advantage to our dairy industry.''

No Known Cure for Disease

Brucellosis, which is a bacterial infection with no known cure, is sometimes
called Bang's disease. It affects dairy and beef animals, causing the premature
birth of calves and a reduction in milk production. Exposure to the disease can
sometimes cause undulant fever in humans, but there are few cases of that
reported.

''Brucellosis is very definitely the No. 1 disease problem for the livestock
industry of the United States,'' said Sidney Moore, a spokesman for the United
States Department of Agriculture in Washington. ''Our objective is to be rid of
the disease by 1987.''

He said that the financial losses to farmers and cattle raisers from the disease
in 1979, the last year for which figures are available, were $44.5 million. He
also said that the costs of eradication and of preventing the spread of the
disease were about $30 million a year for the industry and $118 million a year
for the Federal and state governments.

As of Sept. 31, there were 7,622 beef and dairy herds - of a total of 1.6
million herds - in the United States infected with brucellosis. By far the
largest incidence of the disease was reported in Southern states with large beef
herds. Florida had the highest percentage of cases, with 1,029 of 21,000 herds,
or 4.9 percent, infected.

Jersey Also to Be Certified

Ten states reported no sign of the disease - Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware,
Hawaii, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, South Carolina and
Vermont - in addition to New York.

In New Jersey, the last infected herd was destroyed on Sept. 28 in Salem County,
according to Dr. Robert Horton of the State Department of Agriculture in
Trenton, thus qualifying the state for listing at the end of the month. If the
zero infection rate continues for a year, New Jersey, too, will be certified as
brucellosis-free, he said.

In Connecticut, the last infected herd was destroyed in July 1980 in Kent. Since
then, according to Dr. George Sturges, the state veterinarian, in Hartford, the
state has been brucellosis-free and expects to be certified as such on Jan. 1,
along with New York.

DRASTIC ACTION WEIGHED TO SAVE FLORIDA CITRUS

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

SECTION: Section 1; Page 8, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 729 words

DATELINE: LAKELAND, Fla., Sept. 14


Florida officials are considering drastic steps to eradicate a virulent plant
disease that threatens the state's $2.5 billion citrus industry.

Today the United States Department of Agriculture embargoed all Florida citrus
shipments, preventing fruit from leaving the state until state officials can
demonstrate that the problem is under control.

A state scientific advisory team urged that the Florida Agriculture
Commissioner, Doyle Conner, use emergency powers to burn large sections of
orange and grapefruit groves in 12 counties. Those groves had received shipments
from a nursery contaminated by citrus canker, a rapidly spreading bacteria that
can destroy fruit and trees. So far the nursery, which is the largest plant
supplier in the state, is the only place canker has been found.

The last outbreak of canker in Florida killed tens of thousands of trees for 15
years before it was wiped out more than a half-century ago.

No Threat to Humans


The disease does not harm humans who eat the fruit of infected trees, according
to the Florida Citrus Commission. The embargo is aimed at keeping infected fruit
from spreading the disease to groves in other citrus-producing states.

The lime crop from South Florida is now being harvested, and some oranges and
grapefruit will be ready for picking in a few weeks. The major harvest, used for
concentrated juices and other processed foods, takes place in the winter.

Florida, the nation's leading citrus grower, was hoping to recover this season
from the late 1983 freeze that was the worst of this century. The freeze not
only damaged fruit but killed trees on more than 100,000 acres of groves on the
north side of the citrus belt lying above Orlando, about 12 percent of the
state's citrus groves.

Commissioner Conner today put off a decision on whether to follow the
scientists' recommendation, which would result in the destruction of many
thousands of trees.

Owners of several of the groves appealed for more time to determine if the
disease actually posed a danger to the entire industry. At a meeting of the
Citrus Commission held here, they told Mr. Conner they would be willing to
quarantine their fruit until scientists could establish the extent of the
infestation.

Danger of Spreading


Others, however, argued that each day the decision was put off increased the
danger of the disease rapidly spreading by rain, wind, animal and human contact
into uncontaminated groves.

No cure is known for citrus canker except the burning of infested trees and the
complete defoliation of others within the same patch of grove.

The crisis began when the canker was discovered late last month on citrus plants
at Ward's Nursery in Polk County in the heart of the citrus belt.Ward's, one of
the oldest and most respected citrus nurseries in the state, grows plants that
are used for grafts on rooted trees in established new groves.

Because of the widespread damage caused by the last freeze, demand for nursery
supplies of seedlings and of cuttings for grafts was at an all-time high, said
Dr. Bernie Lester, director of the Florida Department of Citrus.

Ward's shipped to nurseries nearly 300,000 plant cuttings to be used for grafts.
In addition, it sold 93,800 seedlings and 80,000 budded trees directly to grove
owners.

The advisory panel that has been brought in to assess the problem today
recommended eradication of the suspect plants and trees. The panel said that all
trees and seedlings sold by Wards and traced to citrus groves should be
destroyed and that all citrus trees within 125 feet be burned.

So far, state agricultural inspectors have found no signs of the disease in any
of the nurseries or groves outside Ward's. But canker takes 10 to 30 days to
produce visible signs of contamination.

The great concern is that while the state and the growers wait for visible signs
of the spread of the disease, the single-celled organism can be spreading to
thousands of other trees.

The state has ordered Ward's to burn its entire stock of 1.2 million plants, a
loss that the owner, Franklin Ward, places at $1 million.

State investigators say they have been unable to trace the source of the
contamination at the nursery.

Citrus represents a major share of the state's agricultural economy that is
second only to tourism in terms of importance.

Washington: Errol Woman Convicted Of Making False Statements To The U.S.
Department Of Agriculture

LENGTH: 318  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: US Department of Justice has issued the following news release:



 United States Attorney Emily Gray Rice announced that on January 26, 2017, a
jury found Suzanne Brown, age 51, of Errol, New Hampshire, guilty of twelve
counts of making a material false statement to a federal agency in violation of
Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001(a)(2), after a five-day trial in the
United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.





             The trial began on Wednesday, January 18, 2017 and ended with the
jury's verdict on January 26, 2017. The guilty verdict means that the jury found
that on twelve occasions Brown made false statements and representations in
documents submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA").
Brown, acting as Executive Director of the New Hampshire Institute of
Agriculture and Forestry ("NHIAF"), submitted documents certifying that NHIAF
had paid thousands of dollars to employees for services rendered. These
statements were made in order to draw down funds from a USDA Rural Business
Enterprise Grant. The statements were false because NHIAF had not paid the
employees for their services. In nine of the twelve submissions to the USDA,
Brown created fraudulent invoices purportedly prepared by one or more employees
outlining the services they performed and money they were owed.



             Brown's sentencing before United States District Court Chief Judge
Joseph N. LaPlante is scheduled for May 11, 2017.



             The case was investigated by the United States Department of
Agriculture Office of Inspector General and was prosecuted by Assistant United
States Attorneys Seth Aframe and Georgiana Konesky. Former Assistant United
States Attorney Nick Abramson previously was involved in the matter.

U.S. names key trade officials   Agriculture gets low-key look

BYLINE: OLIVER BERTIN; GAM

LENGTH: 603 words


BY OLIVER BERTIN
Agriculture and Food Reporter
U.S. president-elect Bill Clinton has named two low-profile campaign
workers to key posts in his agriculture department.

And that has left Canadian trade negotiators scurrying to find where
Mike Espy and Mickey Kantor stand on current trade disputes with Canada
and the continuing talks to hammer out a new General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.

Mr. Espy will be Mr. Clinton's new agriculture secretary, if confirmed
by the Senate. A 39-year-old Mississippian with roots in Arkansas, he was
a major Clinton campaign supporter and fellow member of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council.

Mr. Espy has been considered a strong contender for the agriculture job
for some time, despite the opposition of some farm and environmental
groups.

If approved as agriculture secretary, Mr. Espy will have a major
influence on trade policy, the current GATT negotiations, farm subsidies
and the agricultural trade disputes that have soured relations between the
United States and Canada.

Mr. Kantor will become U.S. trade representative. A 53-year-old Los
Angeles corporate lobbyist, he chaired Mr. Clinton's presidential
campaign.

As chief trade negotiator for the United States, Mr. Kantor will have a
major influence on the mood of negotiations at GATT, and between Canada
and the United States.

The current Trade Representative, Carla Hills, has antagonized many
trading allies, and many foreign negotiators will be glad to see her
replaced by someone who could be more amenable to compromise.

The two appointments were seen as political thank-yous for helping Mr.
Clinton in his campaign. In addition, Mr. Espy's nomination has raised the
number of blacks in the cabinet to four, a U.S. record.

However, neither Mr. Espy nor Mr. Kantor are well known in diplomatic
or agricultural circles, and neither is seen as particularly interested in
the agricultural issues that have dominated the GATT talks for the past 10
years.

But their lack of agricultural expertise is not necessarily a bad
thing, according to one Canadian GATT negotiator. "That can be
advantageous," the negotiator said. "He won't have fixed opinions, and
means we may be able to influence him."

Spokesmen for the Australian and Canadian embassies in Washington said
Mr. Espy has been a low-key member of the House of Representatives
agriculture committee and is "not seen to have done a lot. We're doing a
bit of legwork to find out who he is, but there's not much to go on
because he was not that vocal."

Mr. Espy's opinions on such key Canadian concerns as GATT, farm
subsidies and marketing boards are not known. But he comes from a sugar-
growing state and that is seen as beneficial to Canada's marketing boards,
which use comparable border controls to protect the domestic price.

Mr. Espy has opposed efforts to cut price supports for products such as
sugar and honey. He has also fought an attempt to divert tobacco subsidies
to the anti-smoking lobby and opposed national standards for organic
foods.

"I've never been a farmer, but once I came into office (as
representative) I dedicated myself to studying the programs. I think I got
a thorough understanding," he said recently.

Mr. Kantor is an urban lawyer who masterminded Mr. Clinton's
presidential campaign, and is seen as an old-style political insider with
a long list of corporate clients that include Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,
General Electric Corp., Martin Marietta Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co.

Despite criticism from activists, Mr. Kantor angrily denies he has sold
his soul to his clients. "There's always potential conflict when you're as
active as a lot of lawyers are," he said recently.

TEXT:
 [*64]  In this segment, senior Hill staff commented on the preceding
discussion.

Panelist: Mark Halverson, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry,
Washington, D.C.

   Mr. Halverson began by noting the importance of agriculture in the Doha
Round. He noted that a trade agreement will not pass in Congress unless
agriculture is relatively satisfied. This is particularly true, considering the
makeup of Congress, with so many members representing agricultural states and
districts. However, this does not necessarily mean that agriculture has absolute
veto power. It is hard to make any real assessment as to what the situation
might be a couple of years from now, because attitudes can change, and a lot of
considerations come into play for the approval of any trade agreement. Another
factor to keep in mind is the relative strength of the Administration to argue
for a particular deal. The political climate is certainly not the same that it
was at the time leading to the Uruguay Round vote or soon thereafter. The
Uruguay Round was very focused on agriculture and on the benefits of opening
markets; the United States had to make some concessions in terms of actual
reductions in domestic programs. There is currently much more skepticism in the
U.S. farm community, and the climate seems to indicate that the United States
now has to make more concessions, at least in terms of market access. Several
U.S. farm programs are currently being criticized. There is more sensitivity now
about the balance of agriculture exports versus imports, other sensitive
industries that require protection, and particular commodities that are more at
risk.

   Mr. Halverson believes that there are a couple ways to look at the WTO Cotton
case that Brazil recently won against the United States. The case is a strong
indication and expectation that the United States now has to come in line with
the WTO ruling. Some reform is now going to be necessary. By and large, there is
truth to most of this. At the same time, though, the U.S. Congress has not moved
quickly, and the Administration has not been pushing very hard to meet the WTO
deadlines. Mr. Halverson believes that there is a need from the agriculture
community and members of Congress to maintain some reasonably adequate program.

   Mr. Halverson noted that the dynamics have changed considerably from the
Uruguay Round as well. During the Uruguay Round, it was more a matter of the
United States and the EU deciding what would be a basis for an agreement. This
time around, the developing countries are making a much stronger case, which
appears to have gained some legitimacy. However, such developing countries will
also have to make concessions in terms of market access.

   On food aid, the argument is whether the United States should convert what is
now in-kind aid to cash. Under current policy, the United States ships  [*65]
commodities as food aid, either for emergency food relief purposes or
development assistance. The Europeans have been critical of this approach,
arguing that it should be converted into cash assistance rather than provided as
in-kind assistance. The United States finds this approach problematic. Cash
grants may not be the best way to maintain the integrity of the food aid
program, since it greatly increases the risk of diversion of the money for other
purposes, as opposed to getting the aid to where it can actually be helpful to
needy people.

   Mr. Halverson feels that there is room for changes in U.S. domestic policy
but that there is a real political need to maintain some sort of reasonable
system in the United States. There are definitely some benefits for the United
States from trade agreements, and if there is sufficient progress on agriculture
market access, it would lead Congress to a broader consideration of potential
reforms. One of the changes that is being discussed is to put relatively more
money into conservation incentives--the so-called green payments--such as world
economic development, investments in research, or other infrastructures that are
all permissible under the WTO framework. The EU has made some moves in that
direction, as it provides a much higher level of support and payments to
farmers. This will be the basis to find some common ground in the negotiations.

Panelist: William O'Connor, House Committee on Agriculture, Majority Staff
Director

   The situation has changed even more perhaps in the House than in the Senate.
We have had rapid turnover of the Agriculture Committee throughout the years. We
have changed from 15% to 25% of our Committee members every time there is an
election, and after every election, the Committee becomes less and less
pro-trade agreement, and more and more skeptical of the advantages of the trade
agreements. The new members come with the notion that everything negative that
has happened in their home states, such as factory closings or layoffs, is a
consequence of trade agreements. But, whenever their state has been able to sell
their export products abroad, then this is due to brilliant management, not the
U.S. government. This is the type of outlook that people are bringing to the
House. So there is less and less support for the idea that trade agreements are
the solution to people's problems. When the Uruguay Round was completed, nearly
the entire House was supportive of the Agreement, and members were
enthusiastically trying to convince other members to vote for it. However, this
will not be the case for the next agreement that needs implementation. Probably
half of the members will oppose the agreement and some will try to stop others
from voting for the implementation. Trade agreements routinely pass now by only
one or two votes after months of debates and negotiations. For example, in CAFTA
[Central America Free Trade Agreement], there were very few downsides--it was a
very beneficial and straightforward agreement--but it was  [*66]  still very
difficult for the Agriculture Committee to support it. Mr. O'Connor thinks that
the Administration is aware of this situation, and that they are going to try
very hard to bring in an agreement that agriculture can support. But, that is
going to be a difficult task.

   What happened in the Brazilian Cotton case was a very big shock for the
Committee. The Committee is going to be much more careful regarding the rules in
new agreements and the potential for future litigation, than it was in the
Uruguay Round.

Panelist: Kevin Studer, Office of Senator Chuck Grassley

   Mr. Stuart started by saying that he would provide the perspective of Senator
Grassley on agriculture. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita led to record prices on
diesel and energy, and grains got backed up from the river. In sum, farmers in
Iowa have been squeezed. He invited specific questions from the audience.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   1. Can you comment on the reaction back home after the negotiation of the
agreement?

   Mr. O'Connor: Our Congress is going to want to assist the citizens of this
country. Congress would not be very comfortable if some of the current proposals
became the framework for the Doha agreement.

   Mr. Halverson: The reaction to a trade agreement becomes particularly
difficult when you are trying to put side by side the different concessions and
opportunities on both sides of the table.

   2. Is there going to be as much money available for farm programs in the
future as in recent years to offset some of the pain?

   Mr. O'Connor: To some degree, yes. We have been through a cycle after the
1996 Farm Bill, and now it has flipped around. You cannot really predict how
this dynamic is going to be in the future with regard to federal spending.
Congress is obviously going to be a little more hesitant. However, even in a
cautious budgetary environment, agriculture can get more money if the situation
is right. There are certainly cuts currently in place.

   3. How concerned are you that the agriculture safeguard and the sanitary and
phytosanitary standards (SPS) might undermine whatever deal we do get on market
access?

   Mr. O'Connor: As it is right now, if we were to sign an agreement tomorrow,
our five major sources of exports--corn, soybeans, beef, poultry, and pork--may
be facing major SPS problems. So, if there were a deal where the  [*67]  United
States had negotiated improvements in market access to overseas markets, but we
could not export anything because of SPS barriers, then there would be a major
problem.

   Mr. Halverson: I agree, and that is exactly why there is so much skepticism
in the agriculture community.

   4. What is your sense of the percentage of the agriculture community that is
comfortable with the status quo of the agreements?

   Mr. O'Connor: Unless they are convinced that litigation will cost them their
programs, I would guess about 85%. Their leadership is much more focused on the
national and international aspects of an agreement and on the advantages of
trade, but they are not as pushy as before.

   5. Can you create a non-trade-distorting agricultural program?

   Mr. O'Connor: I don't think so. However, a lot has to do with definitions
(for example, "What is non-trade-distorting?" or "What is a green box?"), time
frames, and the nature of the changes.

   6. To what extent is preferential treatment in a WTO Agriculture Agreement an
acceptable option, and if so, to what countries would it apply to?

   Mr. O'Connor: It depends on the country. If you are talking about the poorest
of the poor, you can think about providing development assistance. But when you
are talking about countries that are merely trying to certify their country as
"developing" in order to earn a competitive advantage and escape any WTO
commitments, then it should not be allowed. Countries can also be divided by
sector for these purposes, particularly for those developing countries that are
very developed and competitive in certain agriculture sectors.

CHANCE IS CALLED "QUITE GREAT" FOR U.S. OUTBREAK OF FOOT-AND-MOUTH;
AGENCIES PREPARE FOR WORST-CASE SCENARIO

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: NEWS, Pg. A2

LENGTH: 430 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTONFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE; HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE; SCARE
OUTBREAK; EPIDEMIC; CAUTION; UNITED STATES USDA; FEMA; WARNING


The director of the only federal laboratory that studies and tests for
foot-and-mouth disease said Tuesday that the chances of an outbreak somewhere in
this country are "quite great," given the amount of travel between the United
States and Britain.

"It's only through the diligence of the people at the various ports of entry
that we've been able to keep it out. I'll have to add also luck," said David
Huxsoll, director of the Agriculture Department's Plum Island laboratory, off
Long Island, N.Y.

Foot-and-mouth disease is harmless to humans but has devastated livestock in
Britain because herds are destroyed to prevent its spread. The disease is common
throughout most of the world, including South America, but has not been found in
the United States since 1929.

The Agriculture Department has banned imports of livestock and raw meat from the
European Union and has increased inspections of incoming airline passengers.

"We are doing everything we can to make sure it doesn't come into this country,"
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said at an agricultural policy conference
Tuesday.

More than 16 million people arrive in the United States annually on flights from
Britain. About 2 percent have items that could carry the virus, such as meat and
cheese, according to an Agriculture Department survey in 1999. A much smaller
number - 22 of the nearly 21,000 passengers surveyed - visit a farm or ranch
after arriving here.

If the virus has reached the United States already, it could have been in the
country for only 24 to 48 hours, Huxsoll told reporters at the lab.

"Signs for the disease would appear quite quickly, and we have veterinarians ...
that are extremely alert and sensitive to the appearance to those kind of
lesions, and it would get reported very quickly," he said.

The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, has asked various federal agencies,
including the Departments of Defense and the Interior, to help prepare for an
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.

"We have adequate resources" to keep the disease out of the United States, "but
we are going to continue to look at the systems that are in place," said Kevin
Herglotz, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department.

Representatives of various departments and agencies, including the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, conducted an exercise last week to test their
ability to respond to a worst-case scenario, in which the disease broke out in
Iowa and spread to three other states. It would have required 50,000 people,
including military personnel, to contain the disease.

U.S., EEC square off   over farming subsidies

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 634 words

DATELINE: Brussels BELGIUM


BRUSSELS  (Reuter) - On the brink of a trade war over steel, Western
 Europe and the United States are apparently rushing headlong into a
 similar dispute over agriculture.

A trans-Atlantic row over the cash subsidies the European Economic
 Community hands out to sell off its surplus food production has been
 simmering for months.

Washington appears to be becoming exasperated as the 10-nation
 community digs in its heels in defence of its controversial farm policies.

EEC and U.S. officials at a recent agriculture conference in Zurich
 adopted uncompromising stances in terms that implied a clash was imminent.
    "The Europeans must realize we are running out of patience," Alan
 Tracy, deputy undersecretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said
 in an interview.

Mr. Tracy was complaining about the EEC's complicated system of export
 subsidies, used to dispose of surplus milk, cereals, sugar and meat on
 world markets.

The United States says the Europeans are giving unfair handouts to dump
 the food on world markets, taking away business traditionally won by U.S.
 farmers.

The situation has become more acute, Mr. Tracy said, because of the
 steep drop in income U.S. farmers have suffered in recent years.

With a glut on world food markets next year expected to depress prices
 further, the Reagan Administration is under strong pressure from its
 powerful farm lobby to retaliate against the EEC.

A U.S. farm delegation visiting Brussels recently compared present
 difficulties with the Great Depression of the 1920s.
    "Unless we see some changes (in EEC policies) we will be forced to take
 action," Mr. Tracy said.

The United States is already pursuing several complaints against the
 Community before the international trade watchdog, the General Agreement
 on Tariffs and Trade.

But Mr. Tracy indicated Washington might be forced to take action
 outside the GATT if Europe refused to modify its policies.

One possibility would be for the United States to fund a $1-billion
 (U.S.) credit facility for buyers to encourage them to Buy American.

Another would be for Washington to introduce its own system of export
 subsidies, possibly sparking off a subsidy war.

But EEC officials say they have no intention of adapting their policies
 in response to U.S. attacks.

Claude Villain, director of the EEC Commission's Agriculture
 Department, told the Zurich conference the United States was "living in
 cloud cuckoo land" if it thought the EEC was going to stop exporting its
 food surpluses.
    "The U.S. should have no illusions about Europe's intentions in
 agriculture,' Mr. Villain said, adding that the EEC would do all that was
 necessary to maintain its share of the world food trade.

The EEC Commission has proposed setting up long term contracts with
 developing countries as part of a new overseas sales drive to curb its
 mounting food surpluses.

Mr. Villain also said Washington was already offering a whole range of
 subsidies to its own farmers.

EEC diplomats said Washington's recent decision to impose import duties
 on the EEC's steel sales to the United States had hardened attitudes in
 Brussels.

The duties have put at risk sales worth about $3-billion a year to
 European producers.

EEC Industry Commissioner Etienne Davignon said the EEC would look into
 possible retaliatory measures that would penalize subsidized U.S. exports
 to Europe.

Mr. Villain also indicated that despite Washington's threats of
 reprisals, the EEC would be pressing ahead with plans to limit sales of
 U.S. feedgrains.

EEC grain producers say the exports are adding to massive European
 grain surpluses by displacing EEC-grown cereals in feed for pigs and
 poultry.

If the Reagan Administration refused to negotiate curbs then the EEC
 would take unilateral action, a move which Mr. Tracy said would prompt a
 response certain to damage the EEC.

Washington: Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack Highlights Recent Trade
Breakthroughs with Mexico

LENGTH: 496  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Department of Agriculture, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today highlighted recent progress on a number
of trade issues with Mexico following a panel discussion with Mexico's Secretary
of Agriculture Enrique Martínez y Martínez. The panel was part of the Global
Forum on Agro Food Expectations forum in Mexico City. Vilsack's remarks come as
Mexico's expanded import ruling to allow increased potato imports from the U.S.
goes into effect today. Mexico also recently announced it would expand American
beef imports as well. A full range of U.S. beef and beef products can now be
exported to Mexico, potentially increasing U.S. beef and beef product exports by
$50 million.

At the forum, Vilsack joined Martínez and Canada's Minister of Agriculture and
Agri-Food, Gerry Ritz, for a panel discussion entitled: Integration of
Agro-Industrial Markets in North America: Challenges and Opportunities. The
panelists discussed how the United States, Mexico and Canada can continue to
work together to create jobs and economic opportunity for the agricultural
industry.

"Mexico is an important strategic ally and a critical economic partner to the
United States. In recent months, we have made progress on a number of issues
that will help increase economic opportunity for both of our countries," Vilsack
said. "The United States and Mexico will continue to build on our strong trade
relationships and promote greater market access for our agricultural products."

For decades, two-way agricultural trade between Mexico and the United States has
supported good-paying jobs in both countries. This partnership has helped
leverage existing supply chains, adding to the economic strength of U.S. and
Mexican agriculture.

USDA is continuing to help America's farmers and ranchers reach new markets and
increase agricultural exports. In fiscal year 2013, U.S. food and agricultural
product exports reached a record $140.9 billion, supporting nearly one million
American jobs. U.S. agriculture is on track for another exceptional year, with
exports of farm and food products forecasted to reach $142.6 billion worldwide.

Resources in the new farm bill will allow USDA to continue funding for trade
promotion and market expansion for U.S. agricultural products overseas. USDA has
moved quickly to implement trade promotion programs reauthorized under the 2014
Farm Bill that signed just three months ago. Through the Market Access Program
(MAP), USDA has already provided $171.8 million in Fiscal Year 2014 funds to 62
nonprofit organizations and cooperatives to help build commercial export markets
for U.S. agricultural products and commodities. Through the Foreign Market
Development (FMD) Program, USDA has provided $24.6 million in Fiscal Year 2014
funds to 22 trade organizations to help create, expand, and maintain long-term
export markets for U.S. agricultural products.

FRUIT FLY QUARANTINE AREA EXTENDED IN CALIFORNIA

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 14, Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 405 words

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 24


The area of California where shipment of fruit and vegetables is quarantined
because of the Mediterranean fruit fly was expanded by nearly a third today. The
change, to more than 3,000 square miles, followed discovery of a fertile fly
near a major pepper-growing area.

The discovery also led officials to broaden the zone of aerial pesticide
spraying.  The fly was trapped at the northern end of San Benito County, about
80 miles south of San Francisco. The area added is all of Santa Cruz County and
the northern quarter of San Benito County.

The discovery in San Benito County was bad news for growers who produce bell
peppers near Hollister. The quarantine already involved all or part of Alameda,
Santa Clara, San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Stanislaus counties. The need to fumigate
bell peppers could ruin the crop, which spoils quickly when fumigated.

Spraying of the pesticide malathion by DC-4 airplanes over Hollister was
expected to start tomorrow morning, Mr. Thompson said.

Negotiations on Texas Complaint

DALLAS, Aug. 24 (UPI) - A Federal judge today gave Texas and the United States
Department of Agriculture time to negotiate a compromise on their dispute over
an expansion of the California quarantine zone sought by Texas officials. The
decision by Judge Patrick Higginbotham came a day before he was to rule in a
suit by the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Reagan Brown, against the
Agriculture Department. He has threatened to order fumigated all potentially
infested produce from California.

----

Spraying at Florida Schools

TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 24 (AP) - Students at four schools were advised to stay under
protective cover this morning to protect their clothing as aerial pesticide
spraying resumed in the battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly.

Jerry Redding, spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture, said that each
school in the 12-square-mile spray zone had been notified in advance of the
spraying.

----

U.S.-Japanese Negotiations

TOKYO, Aug. 24 (AP) - United States and Japanese agriculture quarantine
officials agreed today to study the possible end of Japan's strict inspection of
all California fruit for Mediterranean fruit flies.

Japan is accepting fruit and vegetables from outside the 2,427-square-mile area
in California quarantined for fruit flies but is carrying out time-consuming
inspections to make sure the pest is not introduced here.

government is boosting its northern border inspection muscle - and making
Canadian air travellers and commercial shippers foot the bill.

In what it calls an "emergency action," the United States Department of
Agriculture has served notice it will levy a per-trip surcharge on all air
travellers and commercial cargo shippers from Canada, starting Nov. 24.

The U.S. entry fee will range from $5 (U.S.) per air passenger to $488 per
maritime vessel, with trucks paying $5.25 per crossing and railways $7.50 per
car.

The estimated $77-million raised annually will fund a much-expanded agriculture
inspector program to screen air travellers and commercial rail, truck, water and
plane shipments for pests and biohazards.

Air travellers can expect ticket prices to rise to reflect the passenger levy
plus a percentage of a $70.25-per-plane inspection charge. Visitors to the
United States should expect tougher scrutiny from inspectors looking for
prohibited birds, animals, fruit and vegetables.

"The U.S./Canada border . . . is the longest undefended border in the world,"
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a late-August announcement in the
official Federal Register.

"Our current dearth of inspection activity at that border could potentially
leave the United States vulnerable to bioterrorism."

Canadian airlines warned yesterday that the new surcharge will discourage
U.S.-bound air travel, and business groups said they're worried the unexpected
move could mean more border traffic snarls that undermine two-way commerce.

International Trade Minister David Emerson said yesterday that Washington
alerted him to the measure about two weeks ago, adding he plans to keep talking
with the United States to forestall any impact on cross-border business.

"There's no doubt that would be a concern and we intend to work with the United
States to ensure that does not happen," he said in an interview. "Anything that
is trade disruptive is a major concern for me."

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says records show Canada is an increasing
threat when it comes to unwanted plant pests entering the United States,
particularly from third-country products relabelled as Canadian and then
exported in U.S-bound shipments.

"Interceptions at the border, including one in Detroit in 2004 of Spanish
oranges and Dutch peppers, manifested as products of Canada, provide evidence of
this practice," the department said.

Findings "strongly indicate we need to expand and strengthen our pest exclusion
and smuggling interdiction efforts at the border."

Unlike other countries, Canada has until now enjoyed an exemption from U.S.
border inspections of domestically grown fruit and vegetables as well as the
user fees assessed to pay for the checks.

Trade lawyer Larry Herman said the planned changes appear to breach the North
American free-trade agreement. "Border inspections for health, safety and other
reasons can be one of the most aggressive uses of protectionism," said Mr.
Herman of Cassels Brock in Toronto.

The USDA proposes to tax all air passengers from Canada to the United States
because it says border inspection data indicate they "represent another pest
pathway."

Fred Gaspar, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of Canada, which
represents air carriers, called the passenger levy "another nail in the coffin"
for plane travel that would discourage discretionary travel.

He said it's unfair that planes and passengers will be assessed the same fee
regardless of whether they're carrying items worth screening.

U.S. officials said they expect increased scrutiny of cargo that's described as
Canadian-grown fruits and vegetables and said the number of land-border-crossing
agriculture inspectors would jump by nearly 40 per cent to 175 people. An
agriculture official projected that airport-based inspectors would rise to 65 -
25 per cent more than in 2003.

The Canadian Trucking Alliance said it is worried about the impact of more
inspections.

"The hope is the USDA will recognize they cannot start to create bottlenecks at
the border," said Graham Cooper, senior vice-president of the trucking group.

Shirley-Ann George of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce called the levy and
increased inspections one more inhibitor to cross-border trade and a duplication
of existing prohibitions against smuggling.

"At some point, there is a straw that breaks the camel's back," she said.

FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Wheat at 3-Month Highs; Corn and Soybeans Retreat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section 1; Page 39, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 472 words


Wheat futures prices climbed to three-month highs yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade after a United States Department of Agriculture report indicating
United States wheat stocks were about 80 million bushels below market
expectations.

On other commodity markets, corn and soybean futures retreated, livestock and
meat futures were mixed, energy futures were mostly higher and precious metals
declined.

Wheat futures settled 2 1/4 cents to 7 3/4 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.07 1/4 a bushel, the highest settlement for a
near-month wheat contract since June 30.

Corn was 1 1/4 cents lower to 1 1/2 cents higher, with December at $2.33 a
bushel; oats were 1 3/4 cents to 2 cents lower, with December at $1.44 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 1/2 cents to 4 cents lower, with November at $5.68 a bushel.

In a report released after the close of trading Thursday, the Agriculture
Department projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91 billion bushels
compared with trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion.

Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels, compared with
trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion, and the Agriculture Department estimated
soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million bushels, compared with trade
estimates averaging 159 million.

The Agriculture Department report provided the main support for the wheat market
but traders said a surge in export sales of United States grains during the week
also helped raise wheat futures and limited losses in the corn and soybean
markets.

''All things considered, I think the market acted real good,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

The Agriculture Department announced after the close that it had accepted bids
from exporters to cover the sale of 270,000 metric tons of wheat to China at
subsidized prices, and market analysts said Egypt was seeking to buy 500,000
metric tons of United States wheat.

The Agriculture Department also announced that 150,000 metric tons of corn had
been sold to unknown destinations, which is often interpreted as a sale to the
Soviet Union.

Rumors that the Soviets were seeking to buy United States corn had given corn
futures a lift on Thursday.

Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
ahead of the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report, which
estimated the United States swine herd as of Sept. 1 at 58.4 million head, about
the same as last year and very close to market expectations.

Gold and silver futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange,
despite a drop in the dollar, amid pre-weekend profit taking.

Gold futures ended 30 cents to 90 cents lower, with October at $367.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4 cents lower, with October at $5.226 a troy
ounce.

Washington: CBP Agriculture Specialists Interdict Invasive Species of Snail at
Otay Mesa Port; Small Mollusk Carries Potentially Large Economic Impact

LENGTH: 389  words

DATELINE: Washington


Customs and Border Protection, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists at the Otay Mesa
commercial facility intercepted a destructive, non-native species of snail in a
cargo shipment bound for the U.S.

"Keeping this pest out of the nation saves the American agricultural industry
from the expense of eradication, and the hardship of finding their crops damaged
by a new danger," said Pete Flores, Director of Field Operations for CBP in San
Diego. "By stopping destructive species at the border, before they can enter the
United States for the first time, CBP officers and agriculture specialists
protect this vital American industry."

On Thursday, April 10, a cargo truck carrying a shipment of mixed produce from
Mexico arrived at the Otay Mesa port. The commodity was targeted for examination
and referred to the dock for an intensive inspection.

During the inspection process, a CBP agriculture specialist intercepted a live
snail from a box of false pak choy, also known as false bok choy, a type of
Chinese cabbage. Calcisuccinea aff. luteola (Gould) -- photo courtesy USDA

The CBP agriculture specialist sent the snail to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for identification. The Plant Protection and Quarantine division of
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service identified the snail as
Calcisuccinea aff. luteola (Gould), an actionable pest of the Succineidae
family.

The shipment was not allowed entry into the U.S. The importer re-exported the
shipment to Mexico.

The USDA determines which pests are classified as "actionable." If introduced
into the United States, actionable pests have the potential to have significant
economic impact on American agriculture and natural resources because they are
either non-existent in the U.S. or currently have very limited distribution in
the country.

Agriculture specialists protect the United States from the threat of invasive
pests and diseases with inspection and prevention efforts designed to keep
prohibited agricultural items from entering the United States. These items,
whether in commercial cargo or with a person entering the country, could cause
serious damage to America's crops, livestock, environment, and potentially
public health.

U.S., EU reach agreement on agricultural subsidies;
Compromise could remove major roadblock to further trade talks

BYLINE: SCOTT KILMAN, MATTHEW NEWMAN, and MICHAEL SCHROEDER

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: THE WALL STREET JOURNAL; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 699 words

DATELINE: CHICAGO, BRUSSELS and WASHINGTON


The United States and Europe agreed to reduce agricultural trade subsidies and
tariffs, a key compromise intended to jump-start stalled world-trade talks by
persuading poor countries to scale back their own protectionist policies.

The pact, hammered out between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and
European Union commissioners in a late-night teleconference Tuesday, could
remove a major roadblock to further trade talks by addressing domestic price
supports, export subsidies and agricultural tariffs. It could also force other
countries to revamp farm subsidies and other impediments to trade.

Retreating somewhat, the Bush administration offered to rein in its cherished
$3-billion (U.S.) loan-guarantee program for U.S. farm exports. The EU,
meanwhile, signalled willingness to cut deeply into some of its most politically
sensitive agricultural programs, such as export subsidies.

But so few specifics are included in the joint proposal that it is far from
clear how it would impact farmers worldwide. "It is a step forward, but a lot of
details are missing and the devil is in the details," said Ron Gaskill, a
lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which has supported the Bush
administration's goals of lowering barriers to agricultural trade.

Even with few details, some trade skeptics said the agriculture agreement would
hurt poor countries. Oxfam International, which has been waging a Make Trade
Fair campaign primarily centred on agriculture, says the agreement scales back
some of the promises the United States and EU made on agriculture during the
last big meeting of the World Trade Organization in Doha, Qatar, in 2001.

"This is more about show than substance," said Celine Charveriat, head of the
Geneva office of Oxfam International. "By limiting the removal of export
subsidies to a number of commodities, the EU and U.S. are violating the spirit
and the letter of the Doha declaration where, among other things, they agreed to
eliminate all export subsidies."

Allen Johnson, chief agriculture negotiator for the U.S. Trade Representative's
office, said the proposal isn't meant to be the final word, but cautioned that
"if agriculture [issues] don't move forward, nothing will move forward." Global
trade ministers will meet in Cancun next month for the next big meeting of the
WTO, and U.S. and European trade officials are hoping to push the agriculture
talks along with the hastily crafted agreement, which Mr. Johnson nonetheless
called a "major breakthrough."

At the Cancun meeting, the 146 WTO member nations will try to agree in general
on how to lower trade barriers. But the hard part - agreeing to the size of cuts
in agricultural tariffs and domestic subsidies - probably won't come until
later.

One Bush administration official yesterday said that the joint proposal would
require the EU and United States to scale back their favourite ways of boosting
agricultural exports - techniques that both employ to dispose of the surpluses
generated by farm subsidies.

In a nutshell, the United States said it is willing to make its export-loan
program less attractive to foreign importers. Under the program, the U.S.
Agriculture Department guarantees repayment of loans used to buy U.S.
commodities. A Bush administration official said the program, which involves
about $3-billion in loans annually, would be reduced at the same pace that the
EU reduces export subsidies. The United States values the EU's annual
export-subsidy program at about $2.1-billion.

Under the framework, both would have to reduce by an undetermined percentage the
amount of subsidies that tend to spur overproduction, which result in the
surpluses that depress worldwide prices of everything from corn and cotton to
wheat. One example is a U.S. marketing loan program that guarantees that soybean
farmers reap about $5 a bushel, a price that has encouraged growers to plant
more soybeans.

Under current WTO agreements, U.S. subsidies of this sort are already capped at
$19.1-billion while similar EU subsidies are capped at $67-billion.

The joint proposal would also put a cap on the amount that countries can spend
on less trade-distorting types of subsidies.

U.S. signs wheat deals   Exports to Russia to be subsidized

BYLINE: BLM

LENGTH: 369 words

DATELINE: Moscow RUSSIA


Bloomberg Business News
  MOSCOW
 The United States has signed an agreement to sell 400,000 tonnes of high-
quality wheat to Russia, where harvests have been reduced by a drought.

The $86-million (U.S.) accord will provide more than 7 per cent of
Russia's import requirements in 1994-95.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, in a three-day visit to Moscow
for grain talks, signed the agreement yesterday with Deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Zaveryukha.

The 400,000-tonne shipment, which Mr. Espy said "will move quickly," is
part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food For Progress program,
which provides food assistance to emerging democracies. It gives Russia
favourable credit terms with the U.S. Agriculture Department.

The Russian deal was one of two major government-sponsored wheat sales
announced yesterday that together accounted for more than one million
tonnes worth of exports. Separately, the Agriculture Department announced
it had accepted bids from private exporters for the sale of 649,250 tonnes
of soft red winter wheat to Egypt. The sale is under the government's
Export Enhancement Program, which gives exporters a subsidy of $44.95 a
tonne.

The Russian agreement is the last instalment of a $700-million aid
package approved at the Vancouver Summit in April of 1993 between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

Mr. Espy, in his first visit to the Russian capital, conferred with
agriculture and trade officials as part of a journey to assess the
nation's grain import needs and extension of U.S. export credits.

There was general agreement on the need for the United States to grant
export credits for possible Russian purchases of grain, but no dollar
amounts or tonnage figures were discussed, both sides said.

Drought has struck prime grain-growing regions in Russia, which will
need to import 5.5 million tonnes of wheat and 2.6 million tonnes of
course grain such as corn, according to U.S. estimates. The United States
will have bumper harvests this year.

Mr. Espy said he was told Russia would need additional shipments of
corn, wheat and soybean meal, and perhaps unspecified amounts of pork,
beef and poultry.

"We are willing to fulfill whichever request they have," Mr. Espy said.

Drought fears rise on Prairies

BYLINE: Johanna Powell

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 499 words

DATELINE: Edmonton, Alta.


Soil moisture levels are extremely low in broad areas of the Prairies as farmers
prepare for seeding, and significant amounts of rainfall are needed to avert
drought.

Moisture reserves are only 40%-80% of long-term average levels in most of
Manitoba's arable land, 75% of Saskatchewan's and 50% of Alberta's, Agriculture
Canada reports.

A spring snowfall provided some relief in parts of Manitoba, but even there the
subsoil remains extremely dry, according to Jim Tokarchuk, the province's chief
of soil and water management.

In parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, there is ''a high risk of drought,'' says
Allan Howard, Alberta government soil moisture specialist.

''We are very concerned,'' says Hartmann Nagel, president of Alberta farm
organization Unifarm. ''In southeastern Alberta the water table is down 12
feet.''

Above-average precipitation during the next four weeks is required to raise soil
moisture to normal levels, and substantially more rainfall will be needed in
early July, a critical growth period. The forecast calls for warm, dry weather
into next week.

Prairie farmers are expected to take the dryness into consideration when they
prepare for seeding in May.

Low moisture levels will probably persuade any farmers still undecided about
seeding to increase their wheat, barley or oats acreages, says Chuck Penner, an
analyst with AgDecision, the research and consulting arm of United Grain Growers
in Winnipeg.

These crops have larger seeds, which can be planted deeper to take advantage of
any moisture reserves, while the smaller canola and flax seeds must be planted
closer to the surface.

The low moisture level also will affect the seeding plans of livestock
producers, Tokarchuk says. Many who would usually grow a forage crop such as
alfalfa to feed their animals should switch to wheat and barley for feed,
because these require much less water.

He says cattle use enormous volumes of water. There was very little spring
runoff to fill dugouts, so livestock producers in dry areas will have to pump
water from rivers or lakes.

RESERVES LOW

Moisture reserves are similarly low in the western U.S., says Tom George,
director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's resources inventory division.
Soil moisture levels in Oregon, for example, have dropped to 20% of average
levels, the lowest on record.

The U.S. wheat growing areas usually receive their heaviest precipitation in the
winter months, he says, and ''the more we go into spring, the less likely we are
to have precipitation that's going to make any difference.''

The shortage of rain clouds could have benefits, too. Widespread drought in
North America would reduce the size of the wheat crop, which could boost prices
from their current depressed levels.

Despite initial fears that last year would be dry, timely rains helped produce
bumper crops, a contributing factor in the international trade war that drove
wheat prices to record lows.

The value of United States farm exports should increase slightly, to $36.5
billion this year, but the volume of sales will fall about 8 percent largely
because of last summer's drought, the Agriculture Department predicted today.
Richard W. Goldberg, the Acting Under Secretary of Agriculture in charge of
international affairs and commodity programs, said that export values will grow
by $1 billion in the 1989 fiscal year. Volume, however, is expected to drop to
136 million metric tons, down from a six-year high of 147.5 million metric tons
in the year ended Sept. 30. Mr. Goldberg made the forecast at the opening
session of the department's annual Agricultural Outlook Conference.

Agriculture Issues Divide U.S. and Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER

SECTION: Section C; Column 3; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 477 words

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 25


The United States and the European Union, the world's two biggest trading blocs,
are disagreeing over agriculture positions adopted last year, casting doubt on
progress made earlier.

In one spat, the United States has threatened sanctions on a range of European
food exports, from cheeses to olives, in retaliation for Europe's decision in
September to raise import tariffs on rice.

In an interview Thursday, Europe's new agriculture commissioner, Mariann Fischer
Boel, said she hoped to avert sanctions and her office later announced that a
deal had been reached. But the United States trade representative's office
quickly denied that.

''Good efforts were made, but there are issues that still need to be resolved,''
said Richard Mills, a spokesman for the United States trade representative.

Sanctions, slated for March 1, would affect $33 million in imports from Europe.
The United States, however, plans to ask the World Trade Organization, which is
arbitrating the dispute, for an extension of the deadline.

Europe's position in the rice dispute does not bode well for efforts to reach
agreement on agriculture in the Doha round of trade talks, Allen Johnson, the
United States chief agriculture negotiator, said in a phone interview.

''It's not a good sign that Europe is going back on commitments it made in the
Uruguay round,'' Mr. Johnson said, referring to talks concluded in the
mid-1980's, in which Europe and the United States promised to reduce tariffs.

Two weeks ago, in another skirmish, the European Union started paying wheat
producers export refunds to encourage them to sell their produce outside of the
union after a bumper harvest last year.

American officials have criticized the new export refunds, which are designed to
compensate farmers by paying them the difference between the price of wheat in
Europe and the lower world price.

''I understand their concerns,'' Ms. Fischer Boel said, but insisted that under
existing rules Europe had the right to impose that type of measure.

Last year, Europe offered to scrap all export assistance it pays its farmers,
and the United States said it would reciprocate by scrapping export credits and
no longer using food aid as a way of subsidizing its farmers. These promises
were designed to resuscitate global trade talks, which had broken down at a
meeting of the World Trade Organization in Cancun, Mexico, in 2003.

The move seemed to work. Progress in the global trade talks is fastest in
agriculture, according to European trade officials, while progress on services
and manufacturing is slower.

Ms. Fischer Boel and Mr. Johnson will be attending a small ministerial meeting
of trade officials next weekend in Nairobi. Agriculture talks will focus on
technical details, like how to compare tariffs imposed on 8,000 different farm
products by the 148 members of the World Trade Organization.

US OUTLOOK FAVORABLE

FOR EXPORTS TO SOVIETS

Forecasts for U.S. agricultural exports to the Soviet Union appear favorable
through the early 1990s, Paul Dickerson, U.S. Department of Agriculture general
sales manager, said Wednesday.

Mr. Dickerson, speaking to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience, also said he
expected USDA's export credit guarantee programs to continue through the decade.

With the political and economic changes taking place in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, USDA officials have been examining ways to increase sales of
U.S. farm products to those regions.

Mr. Dickerson said the best future opportunities for agricultural sales in
Eastern Europe would be in genetic materials, oilseeds and horticultural
products.

DROUGHT IN FRANCE

CAUSES SWITCH IN CROPS

PARIS - A lack of rainfall in southwest France has prompted farmers to switch
from corn plantings to sunseed, Daniel Tournay, president of the French Grain
Intervention Board, Onic, said Wednesday.

Mr. Tournay told Onic's monthly news conference that corn plantings would be
reduced by 100,000 hectares in 1990-91 (July-June). In 1989-90, plantings
totaled 1.88 million hectares.

Sunseed plantings would benefit from the reduction of corn and would thus total
1 million hectares, up from 800,000 hectares in 1989-90, a spokesman from the
French oilseeds technical group Cetiom said Wednesday.

These forecasts are likely to be revised, since sowing of corn and sunseed does
not start until late April-early May.

Onic also estimated soft wheat plantings at 4.84 million hectares, up 2.7
percent from 4.71 million in 1989-90, and barley plantings would ease 2.8
percent to 1.77 million hectares in 1990-91 from 1.82 million previously.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Searches for Source of Tainted Beef Sent to Switzerland

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

SECTION: Section C; Page 4; Column 3; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 621 words

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 3


The discovery by Swiss health inspectors last July that imported American beef
was contaminated with DES, an illegal hormone, has prompted an effort by the
United States government to trace its source.

DES, or diethylstibestrol, was used as a growth stimulant, primarily among
cattle and sheep growers in the United States, until 1979 when the Food and Drug
Administration ordered it off the market as a suspected carcinogen. Studies
indicated that cancer and other abnormalities could result in the female
children of women who had consumed DES while pregnant.

After failing to discover any DES for several years, the Agriculture Department
stopped testing beef for the substance in 1991.

Swiss authorities said DES had been found during routine testing of two samples
of imported beef, which were supposed to be free of hormones. The United States
Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are trying to
track the source of the contaminated beef.

"If sufficient evidence is found, it is potentially a criminal matter that would
be turned over to the Justice Department," said Beth Gaston, a spokeswoman for
the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

The Swiss veterinary service takes regular samples of American beef imported
into the country, mainly for use by restaurants specializing in steaks. Dr.
Roland Charriere, of the Swiss federal health department in the capital of Bern,
said contaminated products were rarely found.

The United States exported about 1,129 tons of beef to Switzerland in 1998, the
latest year statistics were available, which is one-third of all Swiss beef
imports.

The finding comes at a time when European consumers are sensitive to tainted
foods as a result of several scares involving Coca-Cola products last year and
reports of dioxin-contaminated chicken in Belgium.

Beef, in particular, has drawn increased scrutiny because of the British
outbreak of what is known as mad cow disease, which is caused by contaminants
mixed into feed for cattle. There are fears that mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, could be linked to a similar brain-wasting disease in
humans. After England, Switzerland has the second-highest incidence of the
disease in Europe.

In addition, the European Union has been at odds with the United States over
whether to allow the import of hormone-treated beef. The United States has
imposed sanctions on European goods in retaliation for European barriers to beef
products.

Switzerland is not in the European Union but it bans a number of substances in
meat that are legal in the United States, including melengestrol acetate, which
was also found in the beef samples in July. According to Swiss officials, 26
samples were tested and 5 were contaminated with melengestrol acetate, in
addition to the 2 tainted with DES.

A public interest group, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, wrote
the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, on Jan. 31 that the "discovery by
the Swiss government was troubling both because of the potential health risks to
consumers overseas and because similar contamination may be present in beef
consumed by Americans."

As a result of the discovery, Switzerland has barred two companies from further
imports. They were identified as the Farmland National Beef Packing Company, a
unit of Farmland Industries, and the Bruss Company, a subsidiary of IBP Inc.
Farmland, based in Liberal, Kan., and Bruss, based in Chicago, are among the
biggest United States beef processors.

Dr. Charriere said the beef containing DES had been consumed before it could be
taken off the market. "It was already eaten by the time the analysis came back,"
he said.

Cuttings;
Now, for Politically Correct Tomatoes: All Hail the Hairy Vetch

BYLINE: By Anne Raver

SECTION: Section 1; Part 2; Page 85; Column 1; Style Desk; Pastimes Page

LENGTH: 1028 words


When the United States Department of Agriculture starts mulching its tomato
patch with a plant called hairy vetch instead of plastic, something is up:
Organic gardening has gone mainstream.

More than a year ago, after a number of meetings with commercial vegetable
growers and horticultural scientists, Dr. Aref A. Abdul-Baki, a plant
physiologist for the Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Md., decided to
conduct a test with hairy vetch, a nitrogen-fixing legume that has long been
used as an organic means to enrich and hold the soil.

Dr. Abdul-Baki saw it as an ancient solution to a modern problem. For three
decades tomato growers have used plastic to suppress weeds and to warm the soil
in the spring, resulting in early, heavy yields. But plastic costs money -- to
buy and to apply. It's made from oil, a limited resource. It fills up dwindling
landfill space because it's not biodegradable.

Dr. Abdul-Baki kept hearing these concerns as well as worries that nitrogen
fertilizers and herbicides were entering the ground water. And farmers said
their customers were clamoring for organic vegetables.

Enter, hairy vetch.

This green plant, named for its bushy foliage, is a member of the legume family.
Like the edible pea, its roots attract bacteria that can take nitrogen out of
the air trapped in soil and turn it into a form the plant can absorb. When used
as a mulch, this nitrogen-fixing plant has many advantages, scientists have
found.

It keeps the soil cool under midsummer sun, when beds mulched with plastic can
grow too hot. Its thick mat suppresses weeds. And when the vetch is cut and
decomposes, all that nitrogen is slurped up by any tomato seedlings growing in
its midst.

Hairy vetch also seems to discourage a tomato enemy, the loathsome Colorado
potato beetle, which may be confused by the hairy vetch's smell.

So long, plastic. So long, synthetic nitrogen. So long, herbicides and
pesticides. Hello, organic tomatoes.

The use of mulch to control weeds, pests and insects is an age-old practice. But
it waned during America's love affair with petroleum products.

"The 50's were the years when the polymer chemists made a lot of synthetics out
of petroleum," Dr. Abdul-Baki said. "And we had all these pesticides and sprays
that let us produce attractive, healthy plants. And developing plant varieties
that were insect- and disease-resistant wasn't a high priority."

But as the history of DDT showed, heavy pesticide use actually encourages the
selective breeding of the most resistant insects. "Without realizing it, we were
engaged in a breeding program against mankind," Dr. Abdul-Baki said.

Scientists are trying to develop varieties that are biologically resistant to
insects and disease, but that takes time. Meanwhile, using a plant like hairy
vetch can help produce a healthier, less expensive tomato and not pollute the
environment.

About 40 percent of Florida's vegetable cropland is covered with plastic, Dr.
Abdul-Baki says. "And the total amount of plastic used in the world for
vegetable production could circle the earth about 41 times," he said. "It has a
tremendous pollution factor because it's not fully degradable. It's a mess, and
the environmentalists do not like it."

In the test, scientists planted the hairy vetch seed in September 1990. The
legume developed a hearty root system and grew a good 12 inches before cold
weather slowed growth to a minimum. When temperatures warmed up in March and
April, it took off again.

By April 29, the hairy vetch in Beltsville was up to Dr. Abdul-Baki's chest --
about four feet tall. That day, it was mowed to one inch high.

On May 1, the tomato seedlings were planted right into the middle of the hairy
vetch. No tilling, no turning, no disturbing the soil.

"We have designed a mower that runs over the vetch, chops it up and dumps it
right in position," Dr. Abdul-Baki said. "Then we drill a three-inch hole and
stick the seedling in."

At first the seedlings were difficult to see in the thick green mulch. But a
month later, the tomato plants were 25 inches high. And by harvest time, plants
grown in the vetch mulch yielded 45 tons an acre. Plots with no mulch at all
averaged 19 tons an acre; plastic-mulched plots, 35 tons an acre.

So the vetch had won, thumbs up. And the boisterous beds needed little
fertilizer, fewer herbicides and pesticides and less water.

"That thick mat is like a blanket," Dr. Abdul-Baki said. "It reduces evaporation
from the soil, so it saves water." It also kept the plants cool. "The soil
surface was about 35 degrees lower in the middle of the day than under plastic
mulch," he said.

Beds mulched with hairy vetch had hardly any Colorado potato beetles. Beds
mulched with plastic were heavily infested.

"Our entomologist speculated that the beetle may be attracted by the tomato
smell," Dr. Abdul-Baki said. "When the vetch is cut, its smell dilutes the fumes
from the tomato plant and may confuse the insect."

Growing hairy vetch with tomatoes may also cut down on disease. It is a form of
crop rotation, which farmers have practiced since the beginnings of civilization
in Mesopotamia. But in Beltsville, where the hairy vetch research continues,
scientists are speeding up the process -- by planting tomatoes right in the
hairy vetch. In September, they pulled up the old tomato plants and then
reseeded the untilled fields with more hairy vetch.

"The more you dig, the more you disturb the soil," said Dr. Abdul-Baki, standing
in his field of hairy vetch. "Most of the organic material is near the surface,
and by tilling, you're dumping it down and bringing up the poorer soil. The more
you leave it alone, the better off you are."

Adventurous gardeners who live in areas where temperatures are still hovering
around 40 degrees Fahrenheit may want to plant hairy vetch now for next year.
That temperature range is what it takes for the seed to germinate and roots to
grow. Gardeners in colder climates should wait until early spring. "We haven't
tried this, but there's no reason why it wouldn't work," Dr. Abdul-Baki said.

To locate seed, call your local extension agent or a farm supply store.

150 years of United States Department of Agriculture

BYLINE: Richmond County Daily Journal, Rockingham, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 403 words


May 25--On May 15, the U.S. Department of Agriculture celebrated the 150th
anniversary of its founding.

When President Lincoln signed legislation establishing a Department of
Agriculture, he declared its purpose should "acquire and to diffuse among the
people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with
agriculture." Indeed, the "People's Department," as Lincoln nicknamed it, still
greatly benefits every North Carolina and Richmond County citizen, said Aaron
Martin, State Executive Director of USDA North Carolina Farm Service Agency.

150 years later, those benefits from USDA's contributions include agricultural
research, fuel, economic development, natural resource conservation, and
international trade.

"We take for granted reasonably priced food. And because agriculture is still
half of what we do in North Carolina, we profit from agricultural exports, which
continue to post significant trade surpluses. Jobs, some right here in Richmond
County, are fostered by the agribusiness community," said Martin.

There's little debate that American agriculture maybe the most productive sector
of the U.S. economy. "Let's give much of that credit to the Richmond County
farmer and producers on that one. These agri-business professionals have adopted
technology, effectively managed risk, and are the leading stewards of land and
water," said Martin.

And what will it take for USDA to continue this 150 year success streak?
Continue becoming a more modern and effective service provider is one way. And,
yes, USDA must always administer taxpayer funds prudently, much as Richmond
County households carefully manage their budgets, Martin said.

On that subject, Secretary Tom Vilsack's Blueprint for Stronger Service aims at
further building an already modern and efficient USDA into an organization that
better responds to 21st century agricultural challenges, he said. Blueprint
speaks to how USDA continues to create jobs, support working families,
strengthen rural communities, and builds on the success and productivity of
America's farmers. "I suspect Richmond County farmers and ag producers will be
on the front line, meeting the changing needs of North Carolina and America's
agriculture," said Martin.

Argentina set to conquer global beef market;
U.S. removal of import ban may help spur good growth

BYLINE: BY BETH RUBENSTEIN

SECTION: SPECIAL REPORT; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 780 words

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES


Argentina's beef industry is hoping that this year's long-awaited lifting of a
U.S. ban on its famed beef will help reopen doors to the world's largest markets
and rejuvenate the stagnant industry.

The United States allowed Argentine beef to return to supermarkets across the
country in August - the first shipments of Argentine beef to the U.S. market in
66 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture acted after determining that
Argentina's herds were clear of foot-and-mouth disease. Other countries soon
followed suit, including Canada, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Colombia.

""We needed for the U.S. to lift the ban,'' said Eduardo Pellegatta, an
agriculture analyst for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Argentina. ""Countries often
see the United States as a benchmark.''

The United States is the single biggest beef consumption market in the world and
is expected to import more than 1 million tons in 1997.

BAN HAS LONG HISTORY

When a foot-and-mouth epidemic broke out in the 1930s, the United States banned
uncooked beef from Argentina. The disease is a contagious malady causing
blisters to break out on the hooves and mouths of cattle.

Consequently, Argentina lost its high-ranking position and credibility in the
international market and it took decades to recover. At the turn of the century,
Argentina was the world's leading beef exporter and held a 58 percent market
share globally.

The Argentine beef industry of today ranks fifth, behind Australia, the United
States, New Zealand and the European Union. But Argentine cuts of beef are known
the world over for quality.

Unlike cattle raised on feedlots in the United States or by other large
producing nations, Argentine herds roam freely and feed on the country's vast
grasslands. As a result, the meat is said to be less fatty, more tender and
tasty.

""I'm a believer in Argentine meat because I think it's a cut above the
others,'' said Debbie Celnik, a North American registered dietitian.

That reputation and aggressive marketing is expected to help exports increase by
almost 60 percent within the next five years, according to estimates by the
Argentine Agriculture Department. The country hopes that sample amounts of
inexpensive range land will also help spawn investment. The most notable
investor to date has been Cresud Saficya, an agriculture company partly owned by
financier George Soros.

Argentine agriculture officials hope to quickly displace the European Union as
the world's fourth leading producer and become the top producer by 2001.

WORLD MARKET BECKONS

The United States is already the largest importer of Argentine cooked beef,
which is cooked at very high temperatures to prevent diseases.

The key export targets beyond the United States include the so-called Asian
Tiger economies, where several years of economic growth fueled a new demand for
beef. However, the current economic woes in Asia may dampen the outlook for
Argentine exports. Argentine agricultural officials have said that Taiwan,
Malaysia and Thailand had all negotiated to import Argentine beef.

Beef traders from Russia, the world's third-largest importer, have also been
active in the Argentine market, according to officials at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. Normally importing from Great Britain, Russia has been forced to
look elsewhere after recent outbreaks of Mad Cow disease. Buyers from Moscow are
expected to source as much as 40,000 metric tons from Argentine ranchers
annually, U.S. officials estimate.

Argentina is expected to export 460,000 metric tons of beef in 1997, about half
the level of Australia's foreign sales.

A RATINGS QUANDARY

U.S. consumers are accustomed to buying products rated by the USDA as Grade A,
putting Argentine producers in a quandary. A Grade A rating is only given to
cattle raised on feed lots. And, at the time of slaughter, Argentine cattle
weigh about two-thirds that of U.S. or European cattle. Consequently, despite
being lower in fat, the Argentine beef may be destined for less lucrative
sausage and hamburger markets.

""It is going to take a lot of effort by the Argentine government to regain the
vast market share,'' said Gary Groves, a USDA representative in Argentina.
""Argentina will have to market its product to Americans if they want them to
buy. It is an entirely different product.'' Changing the preference of the
world's beef consumers is not an easy task, Mr. Pellegatta agreed. At a minimum,
Argentine ranchers will not only have to aggressively market their products but
also must offer cattle raised on feed lots in order to meet broader market
demands and compete in different levels of the market.

Washington Nearing Accord on a Big Sale Of Grain to Russians

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 6; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1272 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 24


The United States and the Soviet Union will soon complete a huge grain agreement
under which the Soviets will buy millions of tons of wheat, corn, soybeans and
soybean meal, Administration officials said today.

Officials at the Departments of State and Agriculture said that the basic
outline of the accord had been negotiated in three sessions over the last four
months and that the final details would be worked out at a meeting next month,
probably in Moscow.

Economic and political interests converge in the new grain deal because American
farmers strongly support trade with the Soviet Union. American trade officials
said the Republicans could suffer severe political damage if the Reagan
Administration failed to conclude a grain agreement this year.

The new accord is, in effect, an extension of an existing five-year agreement,
but the United States is trying to get the Soviet Union to increase its
purchases beyond the annual minimum of nine million metric tons called for in
the current pact.

Disclosure of the plan for a new grain agreement also comes at a time when
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, is sounding new alarms about the poor
condition of Soviet agriculture.

Even though the Midwestern drought has sharply reduced this year's American
grain harvest, Agriculture Department officials said the United States had
enough grain to sell to the Russians because it began 1988 with big stocks of
wheat, corn and soybeans.

Foreign grain sales have often been controversial. Ellen Haas, executive
director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group, said
wheat exports to the Soviet Union in the 1970's caused higher food prices in the
United States by reducing the supply available for domestic consumption.

But exports pose less of a threat today, she said, because ''the United States
has sufficient reserves of grain to cushion any price shocks.''

While the exact value of the new agreement depends on world grain prices, it
will represent billions of dollars in business for American farmers. The United
States received $1.6 billion from the sale of grain, totaling more than 15
million tons, to the Soviet Union in the first nine months of the present fiscal
year, from Oct. 1 to June 30, according to the Agriculture Department.

American negotiators said the new pact would probably run five years. Thomas O.
Kay, head of the Foreign Agricultural Service at the Agriculture Department,
said: ''We will finalize an agreement at our next negotiating session. That is
good news for American farmers. States that grow wheat, corn and soybeans should
be delighted.''

The Soviet Union is this nation's biggest customer for wheat, and the United
States is the biggest foreign supplier of agricultural commodities to the Soviet
Union, according to American officials.

Marshall I. Goldman, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, said that
despite Mr. Gorbachev's efforts, the current condition of Soviet agriculture is
''abysmal.'' Twenty to 30 percent of crops rot in the fields, he said.

Mr. Gorbachev struck this theme in an unusually candid report to the Central
Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on July 29. He said: ''We are bound to
be disturbed by the alarming processes taking place in the country's
agriculture. Capital investments channeled into agriculture are not producing
their due returns, are being utilized inefficiently and in many instances are
simply becoming frozen.''

One purpose of the new agreement is to even out Soviet-American grain trade and
to prevent the Russians from disrupting the United States grain market. It does
not limit Soviet purchases, but it requires Moscow to get permission from the
United States if it wants to buy more than certain amounts to be specified in
the agreement.

Under the current grain agreement, which expires Sept. 30, the Soviet Union was
supposed to buy at least 9 million metric tons of American wheat, corn, soybeans
and soybean meal in each of the last five years. Although their purchases
occasionally fell short in some crop categories, they exceeded the minimum in
three of the five years.

In a confidential report describing the latest negotiations, Clayton K. Yeutter,
the United States trade representative, said, ''Our major objective is to
increase the minimum annual purchase requirement.'' A copy of the report was
obtained by The New York Times.

The United States has been trying to raise the annual requirement to about 11
million tons to guarantee a market for the surpluses produced by American grain
farmers. The Russians have been trying to reduce it to 8.8 million tons or less,
even though they might actually want to buy much more in some years. The precise
amount is still being negotiated.

American officials said they were confident that the United States would have
enough grain so it could easily sell the Soviets the amounts envisioned in the
new agreement. They said they did not believe American grain would ever be in
such short supply that the United States would want to suspend the accord.

Since Mr. Gorbachev took power in March 1985, the Soviets have been trying to
reduce their dependence on agricultural imports, but they are nowhere near able
to satisfy their need for corn, American officials said. They want to import
high-protein soybean meal to feed to cattle, poultry and hogs.

Mr. Goldman, who is associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard
University, said that the Soviets were belatedly encouraging peasants to set up
their own farms but that relatively few were doing so.

Even if the Soviet Government could get peasants to work harder, he said, it
would still have two immense problems: roads in the countryside are in poor
condition, so it is difficult to distribute agricultural commodities, and there
are relatively few barns and grain elevators, so it is difficult to store the
crops.

''Considering the amount of their investment in agriculture, it is
unconscionable that the Soviets end up with so little return,'' Professor
Goldman said. The Soviets invested the equivalent of $57 billion in agriculture
in 1986, representing 17 percent of total Government investment that year, he
said.

So far this year, according to the Agriculture Department, the Soviet Union has
bought 9 million metric tons of wheat, 5.2 million tons of corn, 830,000 tons of
soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal from the United States.

State Department officials said it was difficult to predict Soviet grain imports
because there was not a direct relationship between the level of imports and the
size of the Soviet harvest. Even in a good harvest year, the Soviets might
import large amounts of grain, if only as food for livestock.

The Soviets have been trying to increase meat consumption in an effort to raise
the standard of living. But herds of cattle and hogs have been shrinking, Mr.
Goldman said. In recent months, many cities have acknowledged that meat was
being rationed because supplies were inadequate to meet consumer demand.

In his speech to the Central Committee, Mr. Gorbachev said that ''it will not be
possible'' to increase the per-capita consumption of meat and fruit to the
levels envisioned in the current five-year plan, which runs through 1990.

He called for radical changes in Soviet agriculture, saying producers should be
given much more independence. To encourage individual initiative, he said, the
Government should lease land to farmers for up to 50 years.

In that way, he said, ''a person becomes the genuine master of the land and has
a vested interest in seeing'' that it is used efficiently.

China's Grain Import Needs

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 2, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 279 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13


China will be a steady importer of foreign grain, including United States wheat
and corn, for the foreseeable future but will be extremely slow in expanding
those orders from current levels, a senior Agriculture Department official said
today.

Deputy Secretary Richard E. Lyng led an eight-member United States grain team to
China last month to discuss its current and future needs.

Mr. Lyng also announced that ''a high-level delegation'' from the Chinese
Ministry of Cereals will visit the United States soon to continue talks on grain
trade cooperation that were begun last month. No dates have been set.

But Mr. Lyng said the Chinese had acknowledged that ''a major constraint'' to
stepping up grain imports was the country's port and domestic transportation
facilities for handling larger amounts of grain.

Those limit imports to about 15 million metric tons of grain a year, he said,
adding that it will be ''a number of years'' before China has the facilities to
handle much more than that amount.

A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4
bushels of corn.  China signed a four-year agreement with the United States in
1980 in which it agreed to buy a minimum of 6 million to 8 million metric tons
of wheat and corn annually through 1984. About 15 to 20 percent of the grain is
to be corn and the remainder wheat.

Exports of United States grain to China last year totaled about 7.8 million
metric tons, with 6.1 million of wheat and 1.7 million of corn.

FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Resumes Rise on Report Showing Poor Colombia Crop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section D; Page 5; Column 1; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 361 words


Coffee futures prices rose yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in
New York after a United States Agriculture Department report predicted that
Colombia was set to harvest another poor crop, which would keep world supplies
tight amid a shortage of quality arabica beans.

On other commodity markets, soybean futures prices rose as diminishing Brazilian
inventories renewed interest in American soybeans. And gold rebounded slightly
after hitting an 11 1/2-year low on Monday.

Coffee futures rose after Alberto Restrepo, a specialist at the United States
Agriculture Department, said in a report that Colombia was likely to produce
only 11.3 million bags of arabica coffee for the marketing year that begins in
September.

That is well below Colombia's average annual production of 13 million bags, and
the beans are likely to be of lower quality because of bug infestations and
aging trees, according to the report, which was prepared in May but only now
released. Because of that, Mr. Restrepo estimated that the amount of exportable
supplies would fall to 10.8 million bags, slightly less than the 11 million bags
exported during the current marketing year. Each bag weighs 132 pounds.

If the numbers prove reliable, world coffee prices -- which rose sharply early
this year before dropping -- could soar once more amid increasing consumption
and declining production. Colombia is the world's second-largest producer behind
Brazil and is the largest producer of the quality arabica beans that meet
exchange standards.

Arabica coffee for September delivery rose 5.95 cents, to $1.717 a pound.

Soybean futures prices rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade on reports
that new export business might deplete supplies before the next harvest. Sharply
lower prices are said to be attracting new export business as Brazil depletes
its export inventories.

August soybeans rose 25 cents, to $7.22 a bushel, while November soybeans rose
9.50 cents, to $5.9375 a bushel.

Gold, which fell sharply on Monday, regained some of the loss, closing at
$320.20 an ounce, up $2.10, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange.

administrative review of the denial of a new institution's application, denial
of a renewing institution's application, proposed termination of a participating
institution's agreement, and suspension of an institution shall be treated in

China to deepen agricultural cooperation with US

LENGTH: 1061 words


Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency)

Beijing, 12 February - The agricultural ministries of China and the United
States will further enhance agricultural exchanges and cooperation, deepening
mutual understanding and trust, so as to achieve mutually beneficial development
in the future, said Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu on Sunday.

Han made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua prior to Chinese Vice President
Xi Jinping's visit to the United States.

Agriculture was one of the first areas in which China and the United States
began to cooperate, as the two are both large nations of agricultural
production, trade and consumption and viewed agriculture as a strategic and
basic industry, said Han.

After 30 years development, China-US agricultural cooperation has laid a solid
foundation, with extensive exchanges and cooperation at all levels, the minister
said.

According to Han, the agricultural ministries of both countries will push
forward cooperation in the areas of food security, sustainable development,
agricultural trade and science and technology, creating opportunities for
cooperation between agricultural enterprises of the two countries and promoting
joint research on agriculture.

He believes that, with the deepening of agricultural cooperation and the
increasing openness of agricultural trade and investment, bilateral agricultural
cooperation will have broader prospects.

Effective agricultural science and technology cooperation

The United States is a country with advanced agricultural science, technology
and research into such fields as seed breeding and production, and has
world-class multinational companies in agriculture, while China has broad market
demands as well as leading technologies in food production, biomass energy and
agricultural produce processing, said Han.

It will help improving the agricultural science and technology strength of both
nations if China and the United States enhance their cooperation, he argued.

China and the United States have conducted effective cooperation in crop
plantation, stock raising, fishery, agricultural research and education,
agricultural product processing and circulation, he explained.

The two nations have launched more than 500 science and technology exchange
programs since they established the working group on agricultural science and
technology cooperation in 1980, with around 3,000 experts get involved.

They have maintained effective cooperation between academies and universities of
agricultural sciences and nurtured a great number of talents, which have made
important contributions for the advancement and development of agricultural
science and industry of both nations, said Han.

Fast growth in agricultural trade

Han said the fast growth of bilateral agricultural trade has greatly promoted
the industrial restructuring of agriculture and made agricultural produce more
abundant for the two countries.

Bilateral agricultural trade volume has increased to 24.5 billion US dollars
from 4.1 billion US dollars during 2001 to 2010, with an average annual growth
of 22 percent, according to official statistics.

In 2010, China imported 18.6 billion US dollars-worth of agricultural produce
from the United States. This accounted for 13 percent of the United States'
total agricultural exports, said Han, noting China has become the main
destination for US agricultural exports.

In the same year, China exported 5.8 billion US dollars-worth of agricultural
produce to the United States, 12 percent of its total exports in the area. The
United States is the third-biggest recipient of Chinese agricultural exports.

Although the proportion of agricultural trade in bilateral total trade volume is
not high, the two countries still attach great importance to it due to the
unique features of the agricultural industry, said Han.

The growing challenges posed by food security and climate change have also
promoted cooperation between the two agricultural industries, he added.

Increased cooperation on agricultural investment

Han paid great attention to the expansion and reinforcement of bilateral
agricultural investment cooperation, noting enterprises are the main driving
forces for the development of bilateral agricultural trade.

Since its reform and opening-up, China has attracted and made use of foreign
capital to step up its construction of a modern agricultural industry, he said.

The minister noted that a great number of US enterprises have invested in
agriculture in China. From crop-plantation to machinery and sales, these
investments have gained remarkable economic benefit.

Foreign investment also introduced advanced technology and management to China,
which promoted the upgrading of its agricultural industry.

Chinese investments in US agriculture have also increased in recent years, with
growing desire from Chinese enterprises to invest abroad, according to Han.

He called on China and the United States to jointly promote investment
cooperation between enterprises of the two countries in the areas of technology
application and sustainable development, and create a good atmosphere for
developing bilateral agricultural trade relations.

Efficient mechanism for agricultural cooperation

Han said the sustainable development of China-US agricultural cooperation has
benefited from sound and efficient cooperative mechanisms such as the China-US
Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the China-US Joint Commission on Commerce and
Trade and the China-US Joint Commission on Agriculture.

These have established a platform for agricultural cooperation and have given
full play to the guiding role of both governments, he said.

Under the sound cooperative mechanisms, the two agricultural ministries have
maintained regular contact.

In 2011, the two sides held the fourth meeting of the China-US Joint Commission
on Agriculture, which further enhanced its status as the main channel for
bilateral agricultural cooperation and tightened guidance to the two working
groups on agricultural sciences and biotechnology, he said.

In recent years, the two ministries have also enhanced their cooperation in
agricultural policies, market information, research and development of
agricultural sciences and technology, sustainable development and global food
security, said Han.

Arkansas: One of the Best Fields for New College Graduates? Agriculture.

LENGTH: 578  words

DATELINE: Little Rock


Arkansas Agriculture Department has issued the following news release:

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a new report showing
tremendous demand for recent college graduates with a degree in agricultural
programs with an estimated 57,900 high-skilled job openings annually in the
food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and environment fields in the
United States. According to an employment outlook report released today by
USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Purdue University,
there is an average of 35,400 new U.S. graduates with a bachelor's degree or
higher in agriculture related fields, 22,500 short of the jobs available
annually.

"There is incredible opportunity for highly-skilled jobs in agriculture," said
Secretary Vilsack. "Those receiving degrees in agricultural fields can expect to
have ample career opportunities. Not only will those who study agriculture be
likely to get well-paying jobs upon graduation, they will also have the
satisfaction of working in a field that addresses some of the world's most
pressing challenges. These jobs will only become more important as we continue
to develop solutions to feed more than 9 billion people by 2050."

The report projects almost half of the job opportunities will be in management
and business. Another 27 percent will be in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) areas. Jobs in food and biomaterials production will make
up 15 percent, and 12 percent of the openings will be in education,
communication, and governmental services. The report also shows that women make
up more than half of the food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and
environment higher education graduates in the United States.

Other highlights of the reportThis is an external link or third-party site
outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. include:

While most employers prefer to hire graduates of food, agriculture, renewable
natural resources, and environment programs, graduates from these programs only
fill about 60 percent of the expected annual openings. Even as enrollments in
these programs increase and the job market becomes somewhat more competitive,
good employment opportunities for the next five years are expected.
    Growth in job opportunities will be uneven. Employers in some areas will
struggle to find enough graduates to fill jobs. In a few areas, employers will
find an oversupply of job seekers.
    Expect to see a strong employment market for e-commerce managers and
marketing agents, ecosystem managers, agricultural science and business
educators, crop advisors, and pest control specialists.
    Job opportunities in STEM areas are expected to grow. Expect the strongest
job market for plant scientists, food scientists, sustainable biomaterials
specialists, water resources scientists and engineers, precision agriculture
specialists, and veterinarians.

The report, Employment Opportunities for College Graduates in Food, Agriculture,
Renewable Natural Resources, and the Environment, United States, 2015-2020This
is an external link or third-party site outside of the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) website., is the eighth in a series of five-year
projections initiated by USDA in 1980. The report was produced by Purdue
University with grant support from NIFA.

intercepted in a shipment of Costa Rican pineapples is the first recorded find
of this species in the United States.





 CBP discovered the beetle January 29 in a container of 1,575 cases of fresh
pineapples. CBP secured the pineapples shipment for fumigation, and submitted
the pest specimen to the local USDA entomologist for identification.



 The entomologist identified the species as Ayriclytus macilentus of the
Cerambycidae family, a species known to occur in Panama, Nicaragua, Colombia,
and Costa Rica, and advised CBP that the insect is a pest new to the United
States. The national pest identification database confirmed this claim
today.USDA national entomologist confirmed on March 22, 2016, that Philadelphia
CBP intercepted the nation's first Ayriclytus macilentus when inspecting a Costa
Rican pineapple shipment January 29, 2016.According to the USDA, longhorn
beetles pose a significant threat to coniferous and deciduous forests and kills
live trees.



 "Intercepting destructive insect invaders at our nation's borders, and before
they can threaten our agriculture industries, is of paramount importance to
Customs and Border Protection," said Susan Stranieri, CBP Port Director for the
Area Port of Philadelphia. "CBP agriculture specialists take their job very
serious, and recording these 'first in nation' insect interceptions are
significant discoveries."



 CBP agriculture specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences, risk analysis, and in imported agriculture inspection
techniques. CBP agriculture specialists are the first line of defense in the
protection of U.S. agriculture, forest and livestock industries from exotic
destructive plant pests and animal diseases.



 On a typical day nationally, CBP agriculture specialists inspect over 1 million
people as well as air and sea cargo imported to the United States and intercept
4,447 prohibited meat, plant materials or animal products, including 425
agriculture pests and diseases. Read more about CBP's agriculture protection
mission.



 CBP routinely conducts inspection operations on arriving and departing
international flights and intercepts narcotics, weapons, unreported currency,
prohibited agriculture products, and other illicit items. View CBP's 'Typical
Day' enforcement stats at CBP Snapshot.

Farm Numbers Drop In State;
An Estimated 80,245 Farms Counted

BYLINE: Heavener Ledger staff

LENGTH: 315  words


Preliminary findings in the 2012 Census of Agriculture counted 2,109,363 farms
in the United States, according to results issued by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).

The number of reported U.S. farms decreased by 4 percent since the 2007 Census
of Agriculture. In Oklahoma, the number of farms had a larger decline, by 7
percent, and was estimated at 80,245 farms.

"The Census of Agriculture is a complete count of the Nations's farms and
ranches, and the people who operate them, "said Wilbert Hundl, Jr., State
Statistician for the NASS Oklahoma Field Office. "It provides the only source of
uniform, comprehensive agricultural data for every county in the Nations."

The 2012 Census reported several historic, changes in value of sales for
agriculture producers in the United States: In 2012, crop sales of $212.4
billion exceeded livestock sales of $182.2 billion. This occurred for only the
second time in Census history; the other time was 1974. Between 2007 and 2012,
per farm average value of sales increased from $137,807 to $187,093, continuing
a steady 30-year upward trend. The increase of $52,285 was the largest rise in
Census history.

"In addition to looking at all aspects of farming," said Hundl, "the Census of
Agriculture provides the most comprehensive look at operator demographics - an
area in which operators continue to become more diverse, both in Oklahoma and
across the United States." The 2012 Census counted fewer female principal farm
operators in Oklahoma compared to the 2007 Census; however, counties of American
Indian, Asian and Black or African American farm operators continued to trend
upward.

Census of Agriculture preliminary report, additional materials and full final
report when it is released in May, Visit www.agcensus.usda.gov.

FUTURES MARKETS;
Wheat Prices Rise on Prediction Of China Deal, Later Confirmed

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

SECTION: Section D;  Page 20;  Column 1;  Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 412 words


Wheat prices rose yesterday after the Agriculture Secretary predicted that the
United State would approve a new wheat export package for China this week.

After the market closed, the Agriculture Department announced the deal, which
allows China to purchase an additional one million tons of wheat at subsidized
prices from the United States in the coming months.

Copper prices fell to a six-month low. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21
commodities gained 1.34 point, to 236.64.

Wheat prices gained after the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, told
reporters on Friday that he saw a "favorable, positive announcement" on a third
package of wheat for China.

Yesterday, the Agriculture Department said China might make subsidized wheat
purchases until June 30 under the Export Enhancement Program. China has already
purchased more than four million metric tons of United States wheat, about 12
percent of all wheat exports since the marketing year began July 1.

Wheat for July delivery rose 7.75 cents, to $3.5875 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade. On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat rose 8.25 cents, to
$3.6275 a bushel.

The Kansas City and Chicago contracts are for the winter wheat crops that were
planted last fall and will be harvested later this spring.

Spring wheat futures rose after heavy rain in the Midwest delayed planting and
raised concern that this year's crop could suffer if it is planted too late in
the season.

"It's cold, it's wet, and it's just been continual drizzling rain," said Mike
Palmerino, senior meteorologist with the Weather Services Corporation of
Lexington, Mass. "That's delaying them from getting the spring crops planted."

Spring wheat for July delivery rose 9.50 cents to settle at $3.6950 a bushel on
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange.

Copper prices fell to a six-month low amid expectations that manufacturers would
use less of the metal as the economy slows down.

While recent economic indicators have given mixed signals about the pace of
manufacturing activity, an unmistakable slowdown in the automotive and housing
industries has weakened demand for copper, traders said.

"I'd say it is the auto and housing industries that are doing it to the market,"
said Bernie Schilberg, executive vice president with Schilberg Integrated Metals
in Willimantic, Conn.

Copper for July delivery dropped 1.9 cents, to $1.252 a pound on the Commodity
Exchange of New York, its lowest price since Nov. 11.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22


New sales of United States grain to the Soviet Union and China have been
reported by private dealers, the Agriculture Department said today.

An additional 300,000 metric tons has been bought by the Russians for delivery
in 1981-82, the sixth year of a long-term supply agreement with the United
States.

The grain consisted of 150,000 tons of corn and 150,000 tons of wheat to be
delivered in the year that will begin Oct. 1.  Officials said the latest orders
raised to 6.85 million tons the grain that the Soviet Union has bought under
terms of the agreement's sixth year, including 3.3 million of wheat and 3.55
million of corn.

A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4
bushels of corn.  China bought 120,000 metric tons of wheat for delivery this
calendar year. To date, for 1981, China has bought almost 7.05 million tons of
wheat and 215,100 tons of corn, officials said.

Arizona: One of the Best Fields for New College Graduates? Agriculture.

LENGTH: 582  words

DATELINE: Phoenix


Department of Agriculture has issued the following news release:

WASHINGTON, May 11, 2015 - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a
new report showing tremendous demand for recent college graduates with a degree
in agricultural programs with an estimated 57,900 high-skilled job openings
annually in the food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and environment
fields in the United States. According to an employment outlook report released
today by USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Purdue
University, there is an average of 35,400 new U.S. graduates with a bachelor's
degree or higher in agriculture related fields, 22,500 short of the jobs
available annually.

"There is incredible opportunity for highly-skilled jobs in agriculture," said
Secretary Vilsack. "Those receiving degrees in agricultural fields can expect to
have ample career opportunities. Not only will those who study agriculture be
likely to get well-paying jobs upon graduation, they will also have the
satisfaction of working in a field that addresses some of the world's most
pressing challenges. These jobs will only become more important as we continue
to develop solutions to feed more than 9 billion people by 2050."

The report projects almost half of the job opportunities will be in management
and business. Another 27 percent will be in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) areas. Jobs in food and biomaterials production will make
up 15 percent, and 12 percent of the openings will be in education,
communication, and governmental services. The report also shows that women make
up more than half of the food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and
environment higher education graduates in the United States.

Other highlights of the reportThis is an external link or third-party site
outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. include:

While most employers prefer to hire graduates of food, agriculture, renewable
natural resources, and environment programs, graduates from these programs only
fill about 60 percent of the expected annual openings. Even as enrollments in
these programs increase and the job market becomes somewhat more competitive,
good employment opportunities for the next five years are expected.
    Growth in job opportunities will be uneven. Employers in some areas will
struggle to find enough graduates to fill jobs. In a few areas, employers will
find an oversupply of job seekers.
    Expect to see a strong employment market for e-commerce managers and
marketing agents, ecosystem managers, agricultural science and business
educators, crop advisors, and pest control specialists.
    Job opportunities in STEM areas are expected to grow. Expect the strongest
job market for plant scientists, food scientists, sustainable biomaterials
specialists, water resources scientists and engineers, precision agriculture
specialists, and veterinarians.

The report, Employment Opportunities for College Graduates in Food, Agriculture,
Renewable Natural Resources, and the Environment, United States, 2015-2020This
is an external link or third-party site outside of the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) website., is the eighth in a series of five-year
projections initiated by USDA in 1980. The report was produced by Purdue
University with grant support from NIFA.

Family Farms are the Focus of New Agriculture Census Data;
97 Percent of All U.S. Farms are Family-Owned

BYLINE: The Harrodsburg Herald staff

LENGTH: 466  words


The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service
(NASS) reports that family-owned farms remain the backbone of the agriculture
industry. The latest data come from the Census of Agriculture farm typology
report and help shine light on the question, "What is a family farm?"

"As we wrap up mining the 6 million data points from the latest Census of
Agriculture, we used typology to further explore the demographics of who is
farming and ranching today," said NASS Statistics Division Director Hubert
Hamer. "What we found is that family-owned businesses, while very diverse, are
at the core of the U.S. agriculture industry. In fact, 97 percent of all U.S.
farms are family-owned."

The 2012 Census of Agriculture Farm Typology report is a special data series
that primarily focuses on the "family farm." By definition, a family farm is any
farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals
related to the operator, including through blood, marriage, or adoption. Key
highlights from the report include the following five facts about family farms
in the United States: Five Facts to Know about Family Farms

1. Food equals family - 97 percent of the 2.1 million farms in the United States
are family-owned operations.

2. Small business matters - 88 percent of all U.S. farms are small family farms.

3. Local connections come in small packages - 58 percent of all direct farm
sales to consumers come from small family farms.

4. Big business matters too - 64 percent of all vegetable sales and 66 percent
of all dairy sales come from the 3 percent of farms that are large or very large
family farms.

5. Farming provides new beginnings - 18 percent of principal operators on family
farms in the U.S. started within the last 10 years.

"Whether small or large on the East Coast, West Coast, or the Midwest -family
farms produce food and fiber for people all across the U.S. and the world," said
Hamer. "It's due in part to information such as this from the Census of
Agriculture that we can help show the uniqueness and importance of U.S.
agriculture to rural communities, families, and the world."

The 2012 Census of Agriculture Farm Typology report classifies all farms into
unique-categories based on three criteria: who owns the operation, whether
farming is the principal operator's primary occupation, and gross cash farm cash
income (GCFI). Small family farms have GCFI less than $350,000; midsize family
farms have GCFI from $350,000 to $999,999; and large family farms have GCFI of
$1 million or more. Small farms are further divided based on whether the
principal operator works primarily on or off the farm.

Washington: Ag Committee Republicans Seek Meeting with EPA Director to Discuss
Constituent Concerns

LENGTH: 549  words

DATELINE: Washington


Chuck Grassley of Iowa, United States Senator has issued the following news
release:

In an effort to begin a dialogue about important concerns of the agriculture
community about EPA regulations, Senator Chuck Grassley joined Republican
members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to request a meeting with EPA
Director Gina McCarthy.

The senators wrote to McCarthy that they had heard concerns about EPA
regulations from constituents and agriculture leaders in their home states.  "As
members of the Agriculture Committee, we write to request an opportunity to meet
with you so we can share those thoughts directly and have a better understanding
of your commitment, including activities and timeframe, for addressing the needs
of agriculture and rural America," the senators wrote.

"Heavy-handed EPA regulations threaten to very livelihood of farmers and rural
communities," Grassley said.  "There's no question that the EPA needs to be more
cognizant of rural America and the role agriculture plays in a growing economy."

Grassley signed the letter led by Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member
Thad Cochran, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Pat Roberts, Saxby
Chambliss, John Boozman, John Hoeven, Mike Johanns and John Thune.

A copy of the text of the letter is below.  A copy of the signed letter is here.

May, 23, 2014

The Honorable Gina McCarthy
Administrator
Environmental Protection Agency
1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator McCarthy:

We have repeatedly heard concerns about regulations from our agriculture
constituents and rural leaders during their visits to Washington as well as back
home in our states. While the agriculture economy remains vibrant, there are
significant concerns regarding a number of regulatory matters before the
Environmental Protection Agency. As members of the Agriculture Committee, we
write to request an opportunity to meet with you so we can share those thoughts
directly and have a better understanding of your commitment, including
activities and timeframe, for addressing the needs of agriculture and rural
America.

We have heard concerns about the expansion of the definition of "waters of the
United States," pesticide regulations, methane emissions, the handling of
personal information from agriculture operations, and other regulatory issues
that may be on the horizon and could threaten the continued productivity and
economic viability of American agriculture. At a time when farmers and ranchers
face the challenges of managing weather risks, responding to market demands, and
adjusting to changes from the recently passed farm bill, regulatory uncertainty
further complicates the operating environment for producers. The world is
depending on the United States to meet the challenge of feeding a hungry and
rapidly growing global population.

Uncertainty about how and when such regulatory concerns will be resolved not
only threatens America's leadership position in global food production, but also
investment and prosperity in our rural cities and towns, which are dependent on
the health of the agricultural sector.

We look forward to beginning a dialogue about these important concerns in the
near future.

Respectfully,

US reaffirms support to small farmers in Pakistan

BYLINE:  Staff Report

SECTION: Vol. X No. 128

LENGTH: 567  words


US Ambassador Richard Olson Wednesday reaffirmed the United States government's
long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan.

Since 1950s, the United States has been working to support agriculture in
Pakistan, introducing the kinnow orange and helping to double Pakistan's wheat
production. Today, we continue our support because improving crop yields,
protecting food sources from disease and boosting milk production will increase
farmers' incomes, improve nutrition, and ultimately strengthen Pakistan's
prosperity, he said.

During his visit to the National Agriculture Research Centre (NARC), which was
established with the help of the US government in the 1980s, Olson said, "United
States is committed to helping the small farmers of Pakistan through projects
that enhance agricultural productivity."

He lauded the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project
(WPEP), a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) programme managed in
collaboration with national and provincial research partners that has
successfully introduced the UG 99-resistant wheat variety, 'NARC 2011'.

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming
community.

Wheat accounts for approximately 60 percent of the daily caloric intake of the
average Pakistani, so our joint efforts to combat this disease are critical,
said Olson.

The WPEP team and Pakistani scientists at national and provincial research
stations have made great progress in the fight against wheat rusts and I
encourage you to continue your work together, he maintained.

In addition to support for the WPEP, the United States has provided new
harvesting machines and funded improvements to research stations around Pakistan
to develop more disease-resistant wheat varieties. The United States also
provides specialised training opportunities to Pakistani wheat scientists.

The United States and Pakistan have similar agricultural systems and for that
reason we have been effective partners in agriculture for more than half a
century, working together to improve agricultural yields and to combat disease,
said Olson.

Since the 1950s US and Pakistani scientists have collaborated to increase wheat
production. At that time Dr Manzoor Bajwa and Dr Norman Borlaug worked together
to develop 'Mexi-Pak,' the wheat variety that started the Green Revolution in
Pakistan and helped to double Pakistan's wheat production between 1965 and 1970.

Today, our long-term commitment to Pakistan's agriculture sector is sustained
through projects that help fight animal and crop diseases, increase vegetable
and mango production, improve irrigation, increase dairy production and support
wheat research, he added.

Dr Muhammad Imtiaz Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Centre said without disease-resistant varieties of wheat, such as
the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimated Pakistan's annual wheat
harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99 arrives.

Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs 45 percent
of the labour force, making it one of the most significant economic drivers of
Pakistan, Dr Imtiaz said.

Pakistani farmers grew about 24 million tonnes of wheat on eight million
hectares last year, accounting for about 2.4 percent of the GDP.

Deputy agriculture counsellor says US to assist Pakistan agriculture sector

Text of report by official news agency Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)

Faisalabad, 20 April: Deputy Agriculture Counselor US Embassy in Islamabad Devid
Wolf on Friday said the United States assisted the agriculture sector of
developing countries for economic growth.

In this regard, the US is committed to uplift the agriculture sector of Pakistan
by providing funds in various development projects and researches.

He expressed these views while visiting the University of Agriculture Faisalabad
and meeting with UAF Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan at Syndicate Hall.
Talking about various initiatives, he said the US was working on developing
agricultural markets, trade, finance, promoting food and nutritional security,
and supporting sound programmes for livestock and sustainable agriculture.

Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad told the delegation that the university was running around
150 projects with financial assistance of the US for the agriculture sector. He
said the UAF had been working on 12 research projects on dengue with the help of
United States that would bring tangible results.

He said funds being provided by the US were used in faculty development,
technology transfer and product commercialization research.

Chinese Buy Wheat

From US Exporters

Exporters have sold China an additional 405,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices for delivery in the 1987-88 marketing year, the Agriculture
Department reported.

William L. Davis, acting general sales manager for the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an authorized 1.2 million
metric tons of wheat announced Feb. 5 under the Export Enhancement Program.

15 Projects to Receive

Export Assistance

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that 15 projects,
including those sponsored by the American Soybean Association, the U.S. Feed
Grains Council and the U.S. Meat Export Federation, would receive the $ 30
million remaining in the targeted export assistance program for fiscal 1988.

The program is aimed at promoting U.S. farm products overseas to combat unfair
foreign trade practices.

Man sentenced in illegal fruit case

LENGTH: 369 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


A man linked to a conspiracy to import and distribute a banned fruit in the
United States pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five months each in prison and
in home confinement, officials said.

Tu Chin Lin pleaded guilty in Federal Court in Manhattan Thursday to making a
false statement to a government agency, officials said.

The plea came after a nearly five-year federal investigation of imports of a
sweet, white fruit called longans, primarily grown in Asia.

The Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
prohibits the fruit in the United States because it often carries harmful fruit
flies and other exotic pests. It also can carry plant diseases that are foreign
to the United States, agricultural officials said.

USDA officials launched the investigation in the summer of 1994 when its
investigative and enforcement services unit discovered the fruit being sold in
several stores in Manhattan's Chinatown, according to an agency statement.

The ensuing probe, officials said, extended from Florida to Canada. It revealed
that Mr. Lin was conspiring with others to buy the fruit in Canada, and smuggle
it into the United States by falsifying invoices and customs documents.

Mr. Lin, who could not be reached for comment, will serve five months in prison
and five months in home confinement, followed by two years of supervised
release, said U.S. Department of Agriculture officials.

Officials gave no further details as to the age, nationality or background of
the accused importer. They also did not specify whether the longans were being
sold in places other than Chinatown.

""Importing prohibited fruits into our country puts our billion-dollar citrus
industry at risk,'' said Michael V. Dunn, undersecretary for the Agriculture
Department's marketing and regulatory programs. ""Violators of our import
regulations will pay the price for doing so.''

The U.S. attorney in Manhattan indicted Mr. Lin in October, Agriculture
Department officials said.

No other indictments are expected, said Dawn Schu, an Agriculture Department
spokeswoman, but she added that authorities are investigating a few other people
in Canada in connection with the case.

US reaffirms support to small farmers in Pakistan

LENGTH: 603 words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, May 9 -- US Ambassador Richard Olson Wednesday reaffirmed the United
States government's long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan.

Since 1950s, the United States has been working to support agriculture in
Pakistan, introducing the kinnow orange and helping to double Pakistan's wheat
production. Today, we continue our support because improving crop yields,
protecting food sources from disease and boosting milk production will increase
farmers' incomes, improve nutrition, and ultimately strengthen Pakistan's
prosperity, he said.

During his visit to the National Agriculture Research Centre (NARC), which was
established with the help of the US government in the 1980s, Olson said, "United
States is committed to helping the small farmers of Pakistan through projects
that enhance agricultural productivity."

He lauded the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project
(WPEP), a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) programme managed in
collaboration with national and provincial research partners that has
successfully introduced the UG 99-resistant wheat variety, 'NARC 2011'.

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming
community.

Wheat accounts for approximately 60 percent of the daily caloric intake of the
average Pakistani, so our joint efforts to combat this disease are critical,
said Olson.

The WPEP team and Pakistani scientists at national and provincial research
stations have made great progress in the fight against wheat rusts and I
encourage you to continue your work together, he maintained.

In addition to support for the WPEP, the United States has provided new
harvesting machines and funded improvements to research stations around Pakistan
to develop more disease-resistant wheat varieties. The United States also
provides specialised training opportunities to Pakistani wheat scientists.

The United States and Pakistan have similar agricultural systems and for that
reason we have been effective partners in agriculture for more than half a
century, working together to improve agricultural yields and to combat disease,
said Olson.

Since the 1950s US and Pakistani scientists have collaborated to increase wheat
production. At that time Dr Manzoor Bajwa and Dr Norman Borlaug worked together
to develop 'Mexi-Pak,' the wheat variety that started the Green Revolution in
Pakistan and helped to double Pakistan's wheat production between 1965 and 1970.

Today, our long-term commitment to Pakistan's agriculture sector is sustained
through projects that help fight animal and crop diseases, increase vegetable
and mango production, improve irrigation, increase dairy production and support
wheat research, he added.

Dr Muhammad Imtiaz Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Centre said without disease-resistant varieties of wheat, such as
the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimated Pakistan's annual wheat
harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99 arrives.

Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs 45 percent
of the labor force, making it one of the most significant economic drivers of
Pakistan, Dr Imtiaz said.

Pakistani farmers grew about 24 million tonnes of wheat on eight million
hectares last year, accounting for about 2.4 percent of the GDP. Published by HT

U.S. wheat sales to Soviets at peak

BYLINE: (CP)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. H4

LENGTH: 279 words

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba


   WINNIPEG (CP) - The United States is on its way to exporting record amounts
of wheat to the Soviet Union, Canada's largest grain customer, a Canadian Wheat
Board spokesman said yesterday.

Since April, 1987, the United States has sold the Soviets 11.8 million tonnes of
wheat at bargain basement prices blamed for keeping down the market value of
Canadian wheat.

"I think you could safely say it will be the largest," said John Morriss of the
wheat board.

"These are really heavy purchases. A lot of people don't realize how high it's
gone.

Since last spring the United States has wooed the Soviets with generous offers
under the Export Enhancement Program, a kind of deal-sweetening arrangement that
entices importers to buy American wheat.

The two countries grabbed headlines last May after the Soviet Union agreed to
buy 4 million tonnes of American wheat at $80 (U.S.) a tonne, a price about $40
below the world price. The U.S. treasury swallowed the difference.

Since then the Americans have been selling the Soviets a steady supply of cheap
wheat. The subsidy dropped to about $20 a tonne because crop troubles around the
globe have sent world prices inching up.

On Monday the United States Department of Agriculture made another million tonne
offer to the Russians at prices that weren't revealed.

In total that's already more than the 9.4 million tonnes of American wheat
shipped to the U.S.S.R. in the 1972-73 crop year.

That deal, where the Soviets secretly negotiated with a handful of American
grain companies, was dubbed the "Great Grain Robbery" because it sparked fears
of a grain shortage in the United States.

U.S. Says Number of Farm Owners Is at Lowest Level in the Century

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 12; Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 412 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 29


A Government study has found that the number of people who own farmland in this
country has dwindled to the lowest level in the century.

The report, by the United States Agriculture Department, said nearly half of all
American farmland is in the hands of 124,000 owners.

Most of the owners are individuals or couples who own the farms jointly, it
said; corporations hold about 15 percent of the land.

Farm Size Tripled

And while total farm acreage was slightly more than in 1900, the average farm
size has more than tripled, the study found.

The number of owners of farmland is of great interest to the Government because
as it drops, decisions about the use of land and about improvements,
conservation and other significant areas will be made by an increasingly smaller
proportion of the overall population, the report said.

The report, by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service, also
found that many current owners have little direct role in operating the nation's
2 million farms and ranches.

"That means that decisions concerning larger operations are being made by fewer
farmers and fewer, but proportionately more, non-farmer landowners," the report
said. "These changes in the structure of farmland ownership parallel the
enlargement of farm size, reduction in farm numbers and reduction in farm
employment."

The report said a 1989 survey of farm ownership estimated that by the end of
1988, 2.95 million people owned 833 million acres of private farmland.  But
roughly 124,000 owners held 47 percent of the land. And owners whose holdings
consisted of fewer than 50 acres accounted for 30 percent of the total but held
only 2 percent of the acreage.

Outlook for Some Trends

The report also said that of the total number of owners, 44 percent were
non-operators who held 41 percent of the land.

"The century began with more operators than owners, and is ending with
substantially more owners than operators," the study said. "Compared with owners
and operators, the amount of land in farms, which peaked in the 1950's, has
changed little."

The study said current trends should leave 1.7 million farms and 2.7 million
owners by the year 2000, as against 5.7 million farms and 4.9 million
agricultural landowners in 1900.

"The shrinking number of farms and landowners will contribute further to the
decline of rural communities and may affect markets for commodities and factors
of production," the report said.

Farmers on alert for soybean rust; Experts say growers should be prepared, but
not panicked, now that the fungus has come to the U.S.

BYLINE: JOHN EVERLY

SECTION: Tristate; Pg. a3

LENGTH: 406 words


A troublesome fungus that has threatened soybean crops around the world has
entered the United States.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently confirmed soybean rust in
Mississippi, Florida, Alabama and Georgia. The disease was first found in the
United States in two research plots near Baton Rouge, La.

Growers should be prepared, but not panicked, experts said.

Web Link

More information about soybean rust is available at www.soybeanrust.info.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Patty Judge said the Environmental Protection
Agency approved six fungicides on an emergency basis for combating Asian Soybean
Rust in Iowa for the 2005 growing season. The emergency designation includes
Wisconsin and Illinois.

"Even though Iowa does not have Asian Soybean Rust, we must be prepared and plan
to combat the disease before it makes its way across the United States," Judge
said.

The disease can cause extensive damage to plants and can travel quickly through
infected areas depending on environmental conditions. The disease poses no human
health risk, but can reduce soybean yield substantially, said Greg Tylka, Iowa
State plant pathologist.

"There's no guarantee it'll be here next year, or when it will arrive (in
Iowa)," Tylka said. "If it comes to Iowa late in the season, it might not be
worth treating."

The fungus probably will not overwinter in Iowa or other northern
soybean-growing areas, Tylka said. In order to infect Iowa fields, the spores
must be carried from the southern United States by winds every year.

"Soybean farmers in the United States will adjust and take the necessary steps
to manage the disease," said United Soybean Board Chairman Criss Davis, a
soybean farmer from Shullsburg, Wis.

The bottom line, Tylka said, is treatment will not be cheap, at $20 to $25 per
acre.

Faced with that expensive alternative, growers could opt to substitute corn or
another crop on their soybean acres next year, said University of Illinois
economist Darrel Good.

"It is difficult to anticipate the direction and magnitude of soybean acreage
change in 2005," he said. "Producers will have to carefully evaluate all of the
decision factors, including production costs and relative yields and prices of
alternative crops."

Meanwhile, lawmakers included $800,000 in a 2005 federal bill for soybean rust
research by Iowa State University and the Agriculture Research Service in
Beltsville, Md.

Positive outlook for harvest cuts soybean prices

BYLINE: Farm Market News

SECTION: SECTION 3, THE MARKETS; Pg. 20, FARM COMMODITIES

LENGTH: 352 words

DATELINE: Winnipeg,Man.


  Favorable harvest conditions continued to depress Chicago Board of Trade
soybean futures yesterday.

Speculation that soybean production will be higher than the markets had been
expecting also helped undermine values.

CBOT soybean prices settled US2 1/2 cents-to-US5 cents-a-bushel lower with the
January contract - the most active - closing at US$5.84 3/4, down US4 cents.

From the opening of the market, CBOT soybean prices were put on the defensive by
a production estimate by private crop forecaster Sparks Commodities. It now sees
soybean production in the U.S. coming in at 1.921 billion bushels. In September,
the U.S. Agriculture Department estimated the crop at 1.889 billion bushels.

Investors also speculate that soybean yields are coming in better than expected
in many areas, which in turn supported the contention that crop size could rise
considerably from the Agriculture Department's most recent estimate.

The U.S. National Weather Service in its latest forecast calls for clear
conditions over the next six to 10 days in the U.S. Midwest, which prompted
speculation that harvest progress would be good and depressed CBOT soybean
futures.

Corn futures at the CBOT closed unchanged to US4 1/4 cents higher. December was
the most actively traded contract, ending US4 1/4 cents-a-bushel higher at
US$2.43 1/4.

Corn values had been pressured early in the session yesterday by the ongoing
harvest. However, by midday, those prices turned higher, reflecting trade rumors
that the Soviet Union may have purchased up to seven million metric tons of U.S.
corn during the past few days. The U.S. Agriculture Department has confirmed a
total of 2.2 million metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union so far.

CBOT wheat futures ended US1 1/2 cents higher to US2 1/2 cents lower. The
December contract finished US1 1/2 cents higher at US$4.10 3/4.

Buying in the recent contracts yesterday reflected news that Egypt will bid for
more subsidized wheat soon. Country movement to the elevator system has also
been slow, which also lifted CBOT wheat values slightly.

House scrap over farm subsidies

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 417 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  Farmers across the U.S. looking forward to continued government subsidies for
their crops have encountered opposition from city-bound congressmen.

The congressmen plan to fight passage of a new farm bill when it reaches the
floor of the House of Representatives this summer. The lawmakers accuse their
farm-district counterparts of writing programs that benefit their rural
constituents at the expense of the mass of U.S. consumers and taxpayers.

''In the past, the Agriculture Committee got up and then everyone voted for the
bill,'' said Rep. Barney Frank. (D-Mass.) ''Those days are over.''

Under the 1985 Farm Act, farmers receive ''deficiency payments,'' or subsidies,
on certain crops if they keep some acreage fallow to comply with conservation
plans or reduce output. The payments are made directly to farmers, supporting
prices by cutting supply.

The House Agriculture Committee's 1990 farm bill will establish U.S. agriculture
policy for the next five years. Members of both the House and Senate agriculture
committees, which are working on bill proposals, appear determined to support
farmers' incomes at current levels.

But the 20-strong coalition of opposing congressmen says farm programs cost too
much, damage the environment, impede international trade and only help big-scale
farmers - not the small family farms they are supposed to preserve.

Stephen Dewhurst, the Agriculture Department's budget officer, said that by
October almost US$80 billion will have been spent on the programs over the past
five years. If they continue at this year's pace, US$56 billion would be paid
out over the next five years.

The Bush administration, struggling with a budget deficit and teetering close to
new taxes, wants that cut to US$48 billion.

But the farmers have strong support.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza dismissed the coalition of
opposing congressmen as a bunch of city folk who do not understand agriculture
and do not appreciate the way past farm policies have produced a bounty of
low-cost food.

One proposal from the urban congressmen, which would have a far-reaching effect
on farm policy, is to set a US$100,000 annual-income ceiling, or means test, for
those qualifying for subsidies.

The urban group argues that farmers making more than most U.S. citizens should
not receive payments. By gearing payments to acreage and production, they say,
the government spends most of its money on bigger farms.

Family Farms are the Focus of New Agriculture Census Data

BYLINE: The Oakes Times staff

LENGTH: 501  words


97 Percent of All U.S. Farms are Family-Owned, USDA Reports

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural
Statistics Service (NASS) reports that family-owned farms remain the backbone of
the agriculture industry. The latest data come from the Census of Agriculture
farm typology report and help shine light on the question, "What is a family
farm?"

"As we wrap up mining the 6 million data points from the latest Census of
Agriculture, we used typology to further explore the demographics of who is
farming and ranching today," said NASS Statistics Division Director Hubert
Hamer. "What we found is that family-owned businesses, while very diverse, are
at the core of the U.S. agriculture industry. In fact, 97 percent of all U.S.
farms are family-owned."

The 2012 Census of Agriculture Farm Typology report is a special data series
that primarily focuses on the "family farm." By definition, a family farm is any
farm where the majority of the business is owned by the operator and individuals
related to the operator, including through blood, marriage, or adoption. Key
highlights from the report include the following five facts about family farms
in the United States:

5 Facts to Know about Family Farms

1. Food equals family - 97 percent of the 2.1 million farms in the United States
are family-owned operations.

'2. Small business matters - 88% of all U.S. farms are small family farms.

3. Local connections come in small packages - 58 percent of all direct farm
sales to consumers come from small family farms.

4. Big business matters too - 64 percent of all vegetable sales and 66 percent
of all dairy sales come from the 3 percent of farms that are large or very large
family farms.

5. Farming provides new beginnings - 18 percent of principal operators on family
farms in the U.S. started within the last 10 years.

"Whether small or large - on the East Coast, West Coast, or the Midwest - family
farms produce food and fiber for people all across the U.S. and the world," said
Hamer. "It's due in part to information such as this from the Census of
Agriculture that we can help show the uniqueness and importance of U.S.
agriculture to rural communities, families, and the world."

The 2012 Census of Agriculture Farm Typology report classifies all farms into
unique categories based on three criteria: who owns the operation, whether
farming is the principal operator's primary occupation, and gross cash farm cash
income (GCFI). Small family farms have GCFI less than $350,000; midsize family
farms have GCFI from $350,000 to $999,999; and large family farms have GCFI of $
1 million or more. Small farms are further divided based on whether the
principal operator works primarily on or off the farm.

China has agreed to import all varieties of apples from the United States, the
US Department of Agriculture said on Monday.

The green light for the shipments follows an agreement signed by the USDA and
China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
in San Francisco, California over the weekend.

"The efforts will result in high quality, fresh US apple varieties being made
available to consumers in China and boost sales for American apple producers,"
said Tom Vilsack, the US secretary of agriculture, in a statement.

US fresh apple exports were valued at more than $1 billion in 2013. The USDA
estimates that the agreement can increase total apple exports by around 10
percent, with a target of shipping $100 million of apples to China every year in
two years.

Previously, China only allowed the Red Delicious and Golden Delicious varieties
to enter the country but suspended orders in August 2012 after repeated
detection of apple pests. The suspension was lifted in October, 2014.

Apple imports from the US surpassed 54,446 metric tons and were valued at $55
million during the 2010-11 marketing years.

The Washington Apple Commission, representing producers in Washington State that
account for 90 percent of all US apple exports, has been advocating for China to
open its doors to the many varieties of apples grown in the state since 1995.

A key reason is that the Red and Golden Delicious now account for less than 40
percent of Washington's overall production, meaning that over 60 percent of its
apple varieties have been barred from the Chinese market.

Wang Miao, marketing director of the commission in China, told China Daily that
a full access to the Chinese market is an important opportunity for Washington's
apple industry to expand exports.

"Although China is the largest global producer of apples, domestic varieties are
very limited with Fuji apples accounting for around 85 percent of all
production," he said. "We, on the other hand, have eight main varieties and more
than 10 'club' (newly cultivated and limited production) varieties ready to be
introduced to the Chinese market."

With quality and variety on offer, Wang said importers will be able to pick the
products that best suit the taste of their customers.

Jiang Wei, senior public relations manager at Wal-Mart China, said that the
retailer directly imports Red Delicious apples from the US and it has been
welcomed by customers for its high quality and competitive prices.

China has agreed to import all varieties of apples from the United States, the
US Department of Agriculture said on Monday.

The green light for the shipments follows an agreement signed by the USDA and
China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
in San Francisco, California over the weekend.

"The efforts will result in high quality, fresh US apple varieties being made
available to consumers in China and boost sales for American apple producers,"
said Tom Vilsack, the US secretary of agriculture, in a statement.

US fresh apple exports were valued at more than $1 billion in 2013. The USDA
estimates that the agreement can increase total apple exports by around 10
percent, with a target of shipping $100 million of apples to China every year in
two years.

EC-U.S. crisis played down by GATT chief

BYLINE: William Dullforce Financial Times of London

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 362 words

DATELINE: Geneva, Switzerland


Trade officials and negotiators Friday played down the crisis in the Uruguay
Round of trade talks resulting from the failure of the European Community and
the U.S. to resolve their differences about reductions in farm subsidies.

Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
did not consider the multilateral negotiating process to be blocked or in
danger, his spokesman said.

The EC and the U.S. were clearly prepared to continue seeking a consensus, the
spokesman added. It was true that negotiators were now faced with the toughest
issues of all, but the fact that EC and U.S. agricultural negotiators had
returned to their capitals reflected their need to seek new instructions to
continue negotiating.

A senior U.S. official said the round was ''still a viable process.'' There were
important stumbling blocks, particularly between the U.S. and the EC in
agriculture, but there were also lots elsewhere.

EC and U.S. officials had earlier acknowledged that Guy Legras, the EC director
general for agriculture, and Richard Crowder, U.S. agriculture undersecretary,
had made no progress in their one-day meeting in settling significant
outstanding differences between them over agriculture.

Tension over the farm issue within the EC camp was reflected Friday at a meeting
of trade policy directors from the 12 capitals, which had been switched from
Brussels to Geneva. The French and Irish insisted that the EC should make no
further concessions on agriculture, while the Germans, British and Dutch called
for the European Commission to be given the flexibility needed to seek
compromises.

The French were particularly critical of working papers on agriculture
circulated on Thursday by Dunkel.

In a broader context, Japan and Canada objected to the ''comprehensive
tarification'' - the conversion into customs duties and subsequent reduction of
all barriers to farm imports - which is a basic point in the Dunkel blueprint.
Japan does not want its ban on rice imports converted into a tariff. The
Canadians argue that their supply management programs would be unworkable
without import quotas.

Donors want resources aligned to local agricultural priorities

BYLINE: MARTIN LUTHER OKETCH -1

LENGTH: 365  words


The United States government has been running a Shs402 billion financial support
programme since 2012

Kampala.
The United International Agency for International Development (Usaid) has said
all donor resources for agriculture projects should be well-aligned with
Uganda's national agricultural priorities as outlined in the Agricultural Sector
Development Strategy and Investment Plan.


In her closing remarks during the launch of the agriculture financial year book
2013/14 last week in Kampala, Ms Jo Lesser-Oltheten, the Office Director
Economic Growth Team Usaid/Uganda, echoed the United States government's
commitment to support initiatives that promote agriculture development in
Uganda.
"... The United States Government is earnestly working with the Ministry of
Agriculture to ensure that donor resources are well-aligned with Uganda's
national agricultural priorities as outlined in the Agricultural Sector
Development Strategy and Investment Plan," she said.
Usaid's contribution to broaden the financial sector includes loan guarantee
facilities with lenders; an agriculture equity fund with investor's Savings and
Credit Co-operatives with borrowers, and technology-based funds knowledge
transfer platforms with innovators.
Ms Oltheten said: "The US government continues to look for new ways to support
financial inclusion and eliminate frontiers for access to financial services."
She revealed to Daily Monitor in an interview that the United States government
through Usaid under 'Feed the Future' initiative is running a Shs402 billion
($150 million) financial support programme which started in 2012 and is ending
2017.
She explained that USAID is working with the private sector to promote private
sector investment in three crops namely coffee, maize and beans.
The Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Mr Tress
Bucyanayandi, said there is need to increase financial resources by the
government into the sector using new innovative means such as mobile money
services.
the govt's focus
For close to 10 years, the government has put a lot of emphasis on
industrialisation and many of the upcoming cottage industries are agro-based.

Equestrian events' cancellation raises concerns for Olympics

BYLINE: Karen Rosen; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS OLYMPICS, Pg. 2E

LENGTH: 566 words

DATELINE: Denver


The outbreak of an equine disease that caused the cancellation of the equestrian
events at the U.S. Olympic Festival has raised concerns about the 1996 Atlanta
Olympic Games if the disease is not contained.

There are 130 positive cases of vesicular stomatitis in the Southwest, mostly in
New Mexico. Festival officials feared horses that entered Colorado would not be
able to return home because of national and international regulations.

"I would think an outbreak such as this could pose grave threats to the
equestrian events in Atlanta," said Bill Barnes, a shipping agent in New Jersey
who transports horses internationally for the U.S. Equestrian Team. "For the
Games, we certainly don't want to invite horses from abroad and expose them to
various diseases they might not have in their countries."

Vesicular stomatitis is rarely fatal and can also occur in cattle, sheep, llamas
and even humans. It is usually spread through biting insects, but can also be
spread orally, such as when the same "lead" rope is used on different horses.

Barnes applauded the cancellation, saying, "Veterinary officials and other
management showed people their first concern has to be the safety of our
domestic horses."

Kate Jackson, ACOG's competition manager for equestrian events, has been in
contact with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is investigating the
disease.

"So far, I can't see it affecting us," said Jackson. "They're really hoping to
contain it."

Jackson said the disease is not a problem for the Atlanta Cup, next month's
event at the Georgia International Horse Park, because there are no horses
entered from the states with positive cases.

"Let's certainly hope this nasty thing doesn't spread over the country, or then
it could be a problem," said Jackson.

Several states, including New Jersey, where the U.S. Equestrian Team is based,
have banned the entry of horses from New Mexico, Arizona or Colorado, or horses
that have visited those states. Georgia was not on the most recent list. The
European Community has also banned horses that have been in any infected state.

The Festival field included one horse from Georgia, ridden by King Hackley of
Greenville.

Olympic competitors are currently training on horses they plan to ride in the
Olympics.

Modern pentathlon, which also includes riding, was not affected at the Festival
because horses in that sport are supplied locally.

TICKET WOES: A year before the Atlanta Olympics, hundreds of thousands of people
are keeping their fingers crossed that they'll get tickets. On the eve of the
Festival, officials are just as fervently wishing they'll sell tickets to the 36
sports in Denver, Colorado Springs and Boulder.

The Festival, which begins today, has sold more than $ 1.5 million worth of
tickets, or about 200,000 seats. The goal is $ 2.4 million. Encouragingly, the
once-sluggish sales have increased to between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 a day.

The loss of the show jumping and dressage in equestrian was a blow to the
Festival because the sport ranked among the top eight in ticket sales.

CELEBRATION: Opening ceremonies tonight in Denver's Mile High Stadium will
include a salute to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Singer Kenny Loggins is the
headliner, and there will also be a fly-by by one or two United Airlines jets, a
speech by Miss America Heather Whitestone and a fireworks show.

WORKING WITHOUT A NET

HUNGER

GLOWING economic statistics may bode well for Wall Street and middle-class
America, but financial security remains a distant dream for the working poor. As
more welfare recipients and other low-skilled laborers migrate to minimum wage
jobs, food pantries have been besieged with requests for emergency assistance
from people who work but still cannot afford to feed their children.

Last year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that requests for emergency
food assistance rose by an average of 18 percent. Two-thirds of adults who made
those requests were workers. And the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates
that 31 million Americans -- one in 10 households -- live with uncertain or
limited access to food.

When working Americans cannot afford to feed themselves and their children, our
safety net clearly needs repair.

At the heart of that safety net is the federal food stamp program. Food stamp
eligibility rules exclude many working poor families. And families that qualify
often fail to receive them. Participation in the program nationally has dropped
by one-third since 1994.

In Missouri, a study by the Missouri Association for Social Welfare estimated
that only 57 percent of those who qualify are receiving food stamps. A strong
economy accounts for some of that decline. But persistent poverty rates -- plus
long lines at soup kitchens and food pantries nationwide -- suggest that many
Americans who need food stamps are not getting them.

Critics of the food stamp program in Missouri blame welfare reform and its
resulting confusion for leading some former welfare recipients -- and even some
of their caseworkers -- to believe they no longer qualify for food stamps. The
report also cites a relatively new system that requires the working poor and
others to reapply for food stamps more often and a lack of coordination between
the food pantries that serve the hungry and the Division of Family Services,
which administers food stamps.

Family Services Director Denise Cross said her agency now encourages its county
offices to coordinate with local charities to promote the program. That's a good
start. Ms. Cross should make that push statewide, and accompany it with longer
office hours to make caseworkers more accessible to working clients. Missouri
also must find ways to attract and keep more caseworkers, pay them decent wages
and avoid burying them under unreasonable caseloads.

On the federal level, food stamp eligibility rules must better support the
working poor. The Hunger Relief Act pending in Congress would expand eligibility
to low-income people who are now disqualified because of the value of their car
(which often ensures their continued access to employment). It would also
include legal immigrants -- many of whom work and pay taxes but were cut off
from food stamps in 1996 -- and families that spend more than half of their
income on housing. The cost: $ 2.5 billion over five years -- an investment that
would confirm America's commitment to encouraging work.

Missouri and Illinois lawmakers -- including 18 Missouri and Illinois House
members and Republican Sens. John Ashcroft and Christopher "Kit" Bond of
Missouri and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois, who have not yet signed on -- should
support the bipartisan bill and prove that Americans still bel ieve in rewarding
work, feeding the hungry and sharing abundance in the land of plenty.

CUT-FLOWER IMPORTS may have U.S. producers in the pink.

In testimony before the International Trade Commission, John R. Block, president
of the National-American Wholesale Grocers' Association said that an increase in
imports of fresh-cut roses actually benefits the domestic flower ndustry.

"Because of the increasing availability of roses through imports, non-
traditional suppliers of flowers such as convenience stores have been able to
increase consumer appetites for a product they would not have otherwise
purchased," he said.

According to an October 1988 Penn State University study entitled "Flower
Marketing Information," 779 million roses were sold in the United States in 1987
compared with 592 million in 1984, an increase of more than 30 percent.

The domestic rose industry has shared in this growth.

An April 1988 U.S. Department of Agriculture report says the number of
commercial rose plants being cultivated in the United States rose to 19.5
million in 1987 from 16.4 million in 1984. Mr. Block was a secretary of
agriculture in the Reagan administration.

THE PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT is reorganizing its trade offices around the world in
an effort to better attract foreign investment to Portugal.

At a luncheon in New York last month given by the Portugal-U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Luis Fontoura, chairman of the Institute of Foreign Trade of Portugal,
said that since Jan. 1 it has been responsible for attracting investment to
Portugal as well as promoting Portuguese exports.

Speaking through a translator, Mr. Fontoura said the Foreign Investment
Institute, which used to be responsible for attracting foreign investment to
Portugal, is being phased out.

The Foreign Investment Institute was hampered because it lacked overseas
offices, said Paulo Almeida d'Eca, executive director of the Portugal-U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

"Investment promotion should be enhanced by the fact that the Institute of
Foreign Trade has offices and extensive contacts in over 45 countries," Mr.
d'Eca said.

In line with these structural changes, Mr. Fontoura said, the directors of the
Institute of Foreign Trade had named Jose Vital Morgado the new U.S. trade
commissioner. Mr. Morgado formerly was the institute's director in Portugal.

FOREIGN INVESTORS should look at the opportunities to develop tourism in
northern Portugal, said an attorney at the luncheon.

Preconser Ltd., a Portuguese investment group, has assembled between 200 and 250
acres in one valley that it intends to transform into a Catskill, N.Y.-like
development near the town of Oliveira do-Hospital, the attorney said.

"The valley, which is north of the university town of Coimbra and near a main
road coming from Spain, is ideally suited to the development of smaller type
accommodations," the attorney said.

The attorney said the investment group had assembled about 40 percent of the $
20 million needed for the development project. The Portuguese government is
expected to be a significant contributor.

US to continue support to agriculture sector: Olson

SECTION: Vol. XLIX No. 128

LENGTH: 639  words


US Ambassador Richard Olson on Wednesday reaffirmed the United States
government's long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan. "Since the
1950s, the United States has been working to support agriculture in Pakistan,
introducing the Kinnow orange and helping to double Pakistan's wheat production.
Today, we continue our support because improving crop yields, protecting food
sources from disease, and boosting milk production will increase farmers'
incomes, improve nutrition, and ultimately strengthen Pakistan's prosperity."

Addressing a gathering of government officials, researchers, and farmers during
his visit to the National Agriculture Research Center (NARC), which was
established with the help of the US government in the 1980s, Ambassador Olson
said, "The United States is committed to helping the small farmers of Pakistan
through projects that enhance agricultural productivity." The Ambassador lauded
the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project (WPEP), a United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program managed in collaboration with
national and provincial research partners that has successfully introduced the
UG 99-resistant wheat variety, "NARC 2011."

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming
community. "Wheat accounts for approximately 60 percent of the daily caloric
intake of the average Pakistani, so our joint efforts to combat this disease are
critical," said Ambassador Olson.

"The Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project team and Pakistani scientists at
national and provincial research stations have made great progress in the fight
against wheat rusts, and I encourage you to continue your work together." In
addition to support for the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project, the United
States has provided new harvesting machines and funded improvements to research
stations around Pakistan to develop more disease-resistant wheat varieties. The
United States also provides specialised training opportunities to Pakistani
wheat scientists.

Dr Muhammad Imtiaz, Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center, noted that without disease-resistant varieties of
wheat, such as the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimate that Pakistan's
annual wheat harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99
arrives. "Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs
45 percent of the labour force, making it one of the most significant economic
drivers of Pakistan," Dr Imtiaz said. Pakistani farmers grew about 24 million
tons of wheat on eight million hectares last year, accounting for about 2.4
percent of the GDP.

"The United States and Pakistan have similar agricultural systems, and for that
reason we have been effective partners in agriculture for more than half a
century, working together to improve agricultural yields and to combat disease,"
said Ambassador Olson.

"Since the 1950s, US and Pakistani scientists have collaborated to increase
wheat production. At that time, Dr Manzoor Bajwa and Dr Norman Borlaug worked
together to develop 'Mexi-Pak,' the wheat variety that started the Green
Revolution in Pakistan and helped to double Pakistan's wheat production between

Drop in Farm Workers Found in U.S. Survey

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 17, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 170 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON , Nov. 28


An Agriculture Department survey of farm workers in the United States shows a 47
percent decline from 1979 to 1981 in the number of migrant laborers traveling to
harvest fruit, vegetables and other crops.

One reason for the sharp decline, to 115,000 in 1981, in a level that held
fairly steady in recent years, may be that illegal aliens have taken over many
of the jobs formerly held by American migrants, the report said.

But that is uncertain. Other possible explanations include radical changes in
crop production patterns and errors in the survey sample.

The report was by Susan Pollack and William R. Jackson Jr. of the agency's
Economic Research Service.

In 1979, a survey of migrant workers reported 217,000 rtraveling from area to
area. That figure was comparable to reports in other years going back to 1970
when 196,000 were reported.

''Another explanation for the decrease,'' the report said, ''may be that farm
operators are increasingly substituting illegal aliens for domestic farm
workers.''

Washington: USDA Expands Public-Private Partnerships to Create Economic
Opportunities through Regional Food Supply Chains

LENGTH: 594  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Under Secretary for Rural
Development Lillian Salerno today announced three new public-private
partnerships that will create economic opportunities in Elgin, Texas; Fresno,
Calif.; and Chicago. The Food LINC partnerships will help community leaders and
private philanthropic partners develop regional food supply chains that drive
job growth and increase farm income while helping to meet consumer demand for
regionally produced food.





 "USDA investments in regional food have the biggest impact when coordination
between producers, processors, distributors and buyers is strong and locally
led," said Salerno. "We are excited to add three new locations to the nationwide
network of cities that are already leveraging government and private resources
to build robust regional food systems, for the benefit of consumers, producers,
and the economy."



 USDA Food LINC (Leveraging Investment for Network Coordination) partnerships
are already working in ten communities to better connect the urban demand for
local food and agricultural products with the supply from regional farmers,
ranchers and entrepreneurs. USDA's initial investment of $1 million provided the
seed capital to attract an additional $2.5 million from 18 philanthropic
organizations, plus more than $1.5 million from the Appalachian Regional
Commission and the Delta Regional Authority. This expansion establishes
partnerships in three new regions:



     The Texas Center for Local FoodThis is an external link or third-party site
outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. will help
farmers in the Elgin, Texas region receive more for their products, support good
jobs in rural communities and improve access to locally-produced food. A town of
8,000 people, Elgin is centrally located within a 200-mile radius of nearly 18
million Texans, making it an ideal production and transportation hub for the
region.

     Food Commons FresnoThis is an external link or third-party site outside of
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. will incubate a
community food hub and grocery store in South Fresno, a community education
space and a processing and distribution facility to develop markets for
agricultural producers in California's San Joaquin Valley.

     FamilyFarmedThis is an external link or third-party site outside of the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. will help producers from
the Midwest take advantage of Chicago's growing demand for regionally-sourced,
sustainably-grown specialty grains.



 USDA has partnered with The Wallace CenterThis is an external link or
third-party site outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website. to document work in each of the 13 Food LINC regions and share best
practices with other organizations that are working to grow similar
opportunities in their communities. Other Food LINC partnerships include the
Louisville Farm to Table Program in Kentucky; the Conservation Fund in North
Carolina; Common Market in Georgia; Rocky Mountain Farmers Union in Colorado; La
Montañita in New Mexico; Fair Food Philadelphia; Metro Washington Council of
Governments in Washington, D.C.; Appalachian Sustainable Development in

U.S. may be heading for a trade war   with EEC over its agricultural policies

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 318 words

DATELINE: Washington DC


WASHINGTON  (Reuter) - The United States and the European Economic
 Community may be headed for a major trade war over EEC agricultural
 policies.

U.S. officials see current and proposed EEC export policies as curbing
 the U.S. share of agricultural markets at a time when bumper crops are
 expected world-wide.

Facing one of the first real tests of the Reagan Administration's
 'tough talk' approach to protecting U.S. agricultural trade, U.S.
 officials have sworn to retaliate if EEC policies edge U.S. farm products
 out of vital markets.

Attacks by U.S. officials on EEC export policies have increased in
 recent weeks as the EEC Commission considers a proposal to tax vegetable
 oil imports at a time when U.S. farmers are preparing to harvest a near-
 record soybean crop.

Meanwhile, U.S. Agriculture Department analysts are preparing an
 internal paper that will outline possible retaliatory measures in response
 to a vegetable oil tax, including possible taxes on imports from the EEC
 such as wine, officials said.

In addition, legislation is pending in Congress to allow the United
 States to subsidize products that compete with exports subsidized by the
 EEC, such as wheat and wheat flour.
    'If they adversely affect our trade flow, we'll have to do the same to
 them,' Thomas Hammer, deputy undersecretary of agriculture for
 international affairs, said. He said that while the United States is
 prepared to 'be as tough as need be' if the oil tax is imposed, the
 Administration is working harder to avert it than it is on planning
 retaliation.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary John Block recently restated in a speech in
 New York the same message he took to Europe during a visit last May. EEC
 action to restrict imports of U.S. soybeans and soya products 'would lead
 to immediate counteraction.'
    EEC policies that do not allow the United States to compete on equal
 terms in other markets will not be tolerated, he said.

US to provide $100 million for agriculture development in Pakistan and
Afghanistan

SECTION: Vol. XXXIV No. 43

LENGTH: 769  words


A trilateral US-Pakistan-Afghanistan forum on agriculture has made a robust
start in its first meeting held in Qatar with United States making initial
commitment of $100 million as first tranche out of a hefty fund it promised to
bolster agriculture in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  "More money will flow as
concrete projects get underway," US deputy under secretary agriculture Burnham
Philbrook observed in the plenary session.  According to a message received here
Friday, the meeting was organized in Doha by the US Embassy in Pakistan for
security reason and to avoid visa and other complications envisaged in holding
it in the United States.  Pakistan delegation that comprised nearly two dozen
top agriculture experts and officials was led by the director general of the
trilateral secretariat, Mr. Zahoor Malik.

Working groups comprising experts from the three countries in their
deliberations focused on areas of food security, trade corridors and water
management. Malik announced that the next meeting of the forum will be held in
Pakistan in April.

Pakistan voiced its concerns on the dam being built on River Kabul with India's
assistance and suggested a profound engagement between Pakistan and Afghanistan
to address these concerns.

Philbrook said development of agriculture in both countries was part of the
strategy to boosting their economies, uplifting living standards of their people
and winning the hearts and minds of the rural populace.  "We believe that peace
depends on improving the lot of the people for which development of agriculture
is vital because more than eighty per cent population depends on it," Philbrook
remarked. He said the United States intends to vigorously pursue the goal of
agricultural growth adding that in case of Afghanistan it would also work as an
incentive to farmers to stop planting poppy.

"Agriculture is key to making peace sustainable" Philbrook said while pointing
out that drug trade is a major source of instability and funding for militancy
in Afghanistan.

Responding to points raised by Mr. Malik in his welcome speech regarding the
tardy approach adopted by the United States in the past in committing funds that
has hampered progress in formulating policies and designing projects, Philbrooke
assured that adequate and prompt funding would be provided to launch viable
programmes in agriculture. He said the US secretary agriculture during his
recent visit to the region felt more determined than ever to build international
awareness about the importance of Afghanistan's agricultural economy to its
long-term security and sustainability.

He referred to last year's trilateral summit in Washington attended by president
Barack Obama and his Afghan and Pakistani counterparts Hamid Karazi and Asif Ali
Zardari during which they agreed on a roadmap for the progress and prosperity of
people of this region.

"We, too, are here in the midst of a great challenge and understand that
generating sustained economic development in Pakistan and Afghanistan will not
be easy. But we will not be deterred."

Malik said the United States has been a generous donor to developing countries
in promoting their economies but its assistance has failed to produce desired
results.

"In this context we hear our American friends expressing frustration why people
hate America despite all the goodwill it has shown in helping the developing
countries," Malik said.

"One major reason for this state of affairs is that the US assistance has failed
to trickle down to real stake-holders- the under-privileged sections of society
who have become poorer over the period of time," he said.  "In order to move in
the right direction, we have to acknowledge our past mistakes and stop enriching
the rich and empowering the powerful, "Malik said adding:"People are skeptical
and there is also a trust deficit as people are not sure if the Americans would
again wash off their hands, as in the past, and leave everything high and dry."

Philbrook said the United States and its allies are determined this time not to
abandon the people of this region and would do everything to become their
partners in peace and prosperity.

Afghan deputy minister Saleem Kundozi said his government's agricultural
strategy has three pillars; to protect and restore the environment; to grow
agricultural production and productivity; and to foster agri-business to boost
exports and family income for creating new jobs on and off the farms. He
underpinned the importance of cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan and

said his country can learn from the broader experiences of Pakistan.

US, Pak, Afghanistan to form working groups in agricultural trade

LENGTH: 558  words


Dr. Zafar Altaf, Chairman, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) Sunday
said that United States, Pakistan and Afghanistan's collaboration to monitor
wheat rust UG99 through trilateral pledge will help to ensure food security in
the region. This he stated while speaking a galaxy of scientists from Mexico,
USA, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Australia, Pakistan and across all provinces who
came to attend this two day symposium organized by PARC in collaboration with
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) here at the National Agricultural
Research Centre (NARC) to make an action plan for combating UG99, a wheat stem
rust.

It is to be noted that the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan plan to
increase cooperation on agricultural development and support research on food
production, agriculture-related issues/resources, and improvement of
agricultural trade and markets.

The countries have agreed to form working groups which were established in the
areas of Food Security, Agricultural Trade Corridors, Water Management and
Watershed Rehabilitation.

The food security working groups priority challenge area targeted stem rust UG99
race as a major hazard to wheat production, The United States plans to join
Afghanistan and Pakistan in accelerating a focused development effort that is
expected to improve trade, increase the productivity of agriculture, revitalize
local and regional agricultural markets improve food security, and transform the
agriculture sector. The United States is planning to spend $27.5 million under
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food for Progress Program for Pakistan and
Afghanistan to help improve the sustainable development of their agricultural
sectors, which will help provide the foundation on which the economies of the
two countries can prosper and thrive.

UG99 since its origin in Uganda in 1999 has migrated reached Iran and has become
a regional threat that now confronts wheat production and stability. It has
opened up doors for Pakistani researchers to take a closer look at the
constraint and make efforts to tackle the problem. Pakistan is well positioned
and has the capacity to handle this program and be the focal point. Through this
activity hub would be promoted the wheat crop yield security functions that will
simultaneously provide opportunities arid strategies complimenting the perceive
trilateral food security mandate.

Pakistan would take the lead role in producing and deploying unique resistant
wheat varieties within the region. At this occasion Secretary Ministry of Food
and Agriculture gave an over view of the symposium. The trilateral alliance
would in addition, allow research to be conducted on the local stem rust
virulence and enhance our capacities to avert the fungal threat, solidify
leadership within Pakistan, building up regional capacities for making global
impacts.  The galaxy of approximately 60 professionals represent
institutions/organizations from Mexico, USA, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Australia
and Pakistan across all provinces.

The participants of the symposium prepared recommendation on a diverse range of
aspects relating to the rust pathogens containment and target on capacity
building across multidisciplinary facets to ensure regional food security and
pave the way forward for other food commodities to be focused upon in the
future.

Expo held to modernize agriculture sector

SECTION: Vol. 21 No. 97

LENGTH: 241  words


- The United States showcased its longstanding support for Pakistan's
agriculture sector at the 5th Annual Dawn Food and Agri Expo in the city with a
pavilion featuring its ongoing initiatives.

The Expo highlighted efforts to modernize the agriculture sector, improve market
access, and increase crop yields, says a press release issued by USAID here on
Tuesday.

The Expo's U.S. pavilion featured agricultural assistance programs supported by
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA).

These programs promote advanced farming practices, enhance export capacity,
build irrigation infrastructure and introduce the latest in water management
practices.

The United States has maintained a longstanding partnership with Pakistan to
improve the livelihoods of farmers and increase access to nutritious food for
millions of Pakistanis.

Since 2009, the United States, in partnership with the government of Pakistan
and the private sector, has invested more than $550 million to fund projects
that support economic growth and agriculture.

Over the past five years, USAID projects have helped increase exports from
Pakistan by $59 million, increased sales by $153 million, and helped develop
over $16 million in new investments.

More than 910,000 farming households have increased their incomes since 2010
utilizing U.S.-funded programs, and 45,000 more have received training in
dairy-related operations.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that Washington
opposes Japan's proposal that it be allowed to subsidize its rice farmers and
keep a ban on rice imports despite other countries' moves toward freer trade.

He said Japan's plan was at odds with U.S. efforts to cut agricultural trade
barriers and subsidies through negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs & Trade.

''Japan's proposal certainly is by no means synonymous with our food position,''
Yeutter said during a break at an informal meeting of agriculture ministers
here.

Japanese Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries Minister Michihiko Kano detailed
Tokyo's proposal at the meeting, with was attended by ministers from Canada, the
U.S., the European Community and Australia.

Expo held to modernize agriculture sector

LENGTH: 246 words

DATELINE: Lahore



LAHORE:  The United States showcased its
longstanding support for Pakistan's agriculture sector at the
5th Annual Dawn Food and Agri Expo in the city with a pavilion
featuring its ongoing initiatives.


     The Expo highlighted efforts to modernize the agriculture
sector, improve market access, and increase crop yields, says
a press release issued by USAID here on Tuesday.
     The Expo's U.S. pavilion featured agricultural assistance
programs supported by the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA).
     These programs promote advanced farming practices,
enhance export capacity, build irrigation infrastructure and
introduce the latest in water management practices.
     The United States has maintained a longstanding
partnership with Pakistan to improve the livelihoods of
farmers and increase access to nutritious food for millions
of Pakistanis.
     Since 2009, the United States, in partnership with the
government of Pakistan and the private sector, has invested
more than $550 million to fund projects that support economic
growth and agriculture.
     Over the past five years, USAID projects have helped
increase exports from Pakistan by $59 million, increased sales
by $153 million, and helped develop over $16 million in new
investments.
     More than 910,000 farming households have increased their
incomes since 2010 utilizing U.S.-funded programs, and 45,000
more have received training in dairy-related operations.

U.S. Demands an Accounting by U.N. Agency

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 8, Column 1; Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 303 words

DATELINE: ROME, March 7


The United States has demanded that the chief of the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization, Edouard Saouma, respond to numerous allegations of
improper management practices, including the distribution of jobs and contracts
to guarantee political support.

The United States is also withholding contributions to the F.A.O., the largest
United Nations specialized agency, as it joins other major donors in pressing
for a series of fundamental changes at the organization.

Dr. Saouma, a Lebanese, has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the United
States, F.A.O.'s largest contributor, ''plays a dominating role'' in a financial
crisis at the agency because Washington's unpaid donations, some dating back to
1986, will total $132 million this year, which is more than half of the
organization's annual budget.

In a letter to Dr. Saouma dated March 3, Fred J. Eckert, the chief United States
representative at the agency, posed 10 questions on financial and management
practices.

He asked whether it was true that some agency employees were members of
government delegations at F.A.O.'s policy-making conference last November and
whether a number of family members of government representatives held agency
jobs. He also asked how many former government representatives the agency
employs.

Mr. Eckert said in an interview that he had evidence that some jobs were being
dispensed in ways seemingly intended to influence governments' policies toward
the agency.

Dr. Saouma said today through a spokesman that he regretted the tone of Mr.
Eckert's letter. He also complained ''that legitimate requests for information
have been presented as aspersions on the managment and reputation of F.A.O.''

A statement by the spokesman said Dr. Saouma ''has scrupulously observed the
rules and regulations.''

FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Grain, Soybeans Ease On Soviet's Prospects

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section D; Page 19, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 368 words


Grain and soybean futures prices edged slightly lower yesterday on the prospect
that the harvest in the Soviet Union exceeded United States estimates and that
it would not be shopping for as much grain as had been hoped.

The bearish sentiment was confirmed in a United States Department of Agriculture
crop and production report issued after the markets closed yesterday. But
traders had already factored in much of the bad news.

''When Russian imports go down, it's usually the U.S. that loses the business,''
said Sue Hackmann of Agri Analysis in Chicago. ''But many of the numbers were
anticipated, and we probably won't see any drastic action taken tomorrow because
of it.''

The most surprising United States production number in the Agriculture
Department report was a projected domestic crop of almost 2.01 billion bushels
of soybeans, higher than most traders had expected.

The other numbers that will put pressure on grains are the revised estimates for
the Soviet Union's production. The Soviet crop, which had been was projected at
180 million tons, was revised upward yesterday to 195 million.

Conversely, the amount of grain the Russians are expected to import slid from 32
million tons to 26 million. United States wheat and corn export figures suffered
most noticeably in that downward spiral.

Livestock and meat futures were mixed to sharply higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

''There was a little concern that the colder weather in the West would mean
slower weight gains, and thus late-arriving animals,'' said Jerry Gidel of G. H.
Miller & Company in Chicago.

Trading in petroleum futures was quiet, partly because the American Petroleum
Institute meeting in Houston this week has siphoned off a number of traders and
also as a result of anticipation of the meeting Friday in Ecuador of the pricing
committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

''Some traders feel something positive could come from that,'' said Peter Beutel
of Elders Futures Inc., in New York, of the OPEC meeting. ''But there's also
some general nervousness about Iran, about the U.S. sending them arms, and about
their behind-the-scenes influence on the Saudis to bolster prices.''

CBP In El Paso Ensures Valentine's Day Flowers Are Pest-Free

LENGTH: 375  words


Washington,D.C.: Department of Homeland Security, The Government of United
States has issued the following news release:

In the weeks leading to Valentine's Day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection's
highly trained agriculture specialists ensure that plant diseases and plant
pests are detected and stopped from being introduced into the United States
where they could cause harm.

At international ports of entry, land borders and mail facilities, CBP
agriculture specialists are the front line in the fight against the introduction
of harmful insects and diseases into the United States.  El Paso area CBP
agriculture specialists performing agriculture exams recorded a total of 50,310
quarantine material interceptions and 3,751 pest interceptions during fiscal
year 2014.
CBP agriculture specialists exam a shipment of cut flowers at the El paso port
of entry in 2014

CBP agriculture specialists exam a shipment of cut flowers at the El paso port
of entry in 2014.

"CBP agriculture specialists prevent potentially harmful plant pests and foreign
animal diseases from entering the U.S. every day," said CBP El Paso Director of
Field Operations Hector Mancha. "The work they do is important."

At El Paso area ports of entry, the most commonly prohibited flowers and plant
materials are chrysanthemums, gladiolas, and choisya (an ornamental filler).
These items are not allowed to enter the U.S. from Mexico because they are known
to harbor harmful pests and disease.

Individuals purchasing floral arrangements in Mexico for transport to the U.S.
should advise their florist so prohibited plant species will not be used in the
arrangement.

CBP processed approximately 801 million cut flower stems during the 2014
Valentine's season from Jan. 1 to Feb. 14. Most of the cut flower shipments are
imported from South America, primarily Colombia, with 506 million stems followed
by Ecuador with 184 million stems. Mexico was third with 43 million stems in
2014. Miami ranks first among U.S. ports of entry for shipments of cut flower
imports, followed by Los Angeles, Otay Mesa and then Laredo. El Paso did not
rank in the top 10 ports for imports.

Farm groups protest

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6, Canadian Briefs

LENGTH: 97 words


Leaders from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the Alberta Wheat Pool,
Unifarm and 18 other farm groups have met in Ottawa to sign a document saying
Agriculture Minister Charlie Mayer has betrayed farmers through a decision to
let farmers sell barley directly to the U.S.  Mayer announced last week that he
was ending the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly on barley exports and setting up
a North American free trade zone in the grain, used as animal feed and to make
beer. The farm groups say Mayer's plan will undermine the wheat board's
strategic selling efforts.

USDA AIMS TO BLOCK MEXICO-CANADA FLYWAY

BYLINE: KEVIN G. HALL; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: FRONT, Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 799 words

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY


A new battlefront has emerged in the fight to keep Anastrepha ludens - commonly
known as the Mexican fruit fly - from ravaging U.S. crops.

Having largely eradicated fruit flies on mangoes imported to the United States
from Mexico, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is searching for a way to keep
Mexican fruit flies that hitch a ride on Canada-bound containers and railers
from getting off in the United States.

Canada has little incentive to do much about the problem, since the flies cannot
survive in its colder climates. Therefore, the focus is likely to be on
preventive measures in Mexico.

"Canada doesn't care because fruit flies aren't going to survive," said Frank
Cooper, a senior operations officer in the port-operations division of the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (Aphis) in Riverdale, Md. But the
flies could wreak havoc on orchards in warmer places, like California, Texas,
Louisiana and Florida.

Aphis, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has published several
proposals for controlling fruit flies in trailers crossing the United States to
and from Canada. It has invited public comment through Oct. 16.

Among its more radical proposals is banning untreated Mexican mangoes from
moving in transit through the United States. Another of its ideas is requiring
that a USDA inspector clear all mango trailers or containers crossing into the
United States.

The agency said the proposal likely to receive the most serious consideration by
the government would require that all mangoes entering the United States be
treated at their point of origin to eradicate fruit flies, or that the fruit be
shipped in insect-proof cartons.

Mandatory eradication treatment - typically, a hot-water bath - may not sit well
with U.S. truckers who move mangoes to Canada from Texas border towns like
Laredo and Hidalgo.

"If you do hot-water treatment, you lose the life of the fruit," said Mico
Gonzalez, who runs the Laredo office of Dallas-based Stevens Transport. ''That's
why they don't treat them when they go overseas" or to Canada.

For the same reasons, Mexican exporters may prefer to provide insect-proof
cartons rather than treat the fruit before shipment.

"You don't have the loss of the fruit," said Raul Nava, director general of
Grupo Navafruit in Mexico City, an exporter of tropical fruits.

He said exporters believe that, with the exception of Florida , most U.S. states
are sufficiently cold to kill off fruit flies, eliminating the need for any new
regulations.

Mangoes are a preferred host for the flies. The insects are troublesome because
they seek out a plant's sap, spreading disease and damaging entire crops.

The USDA has long required that Mexican mangoes destined for the United States
be cleansed in hot water under U.S. supervision before they being exported. In
shipment through the United States to Canada, mangoes are required only to move
in sealed containers.

While the sealed trailers prevent flies from escaping, larvae and pupae may fall
out of shipping cartons and mature during the backhaul.

"Because the container or conveyance is no longer filled with mangoes, there are
no safeguards assigned to its movement, which means that the container or
conveyance could be moved into areas of the United States where Anastrepha fruit
flies would pose a serious threat to agriculture," the USDA wrote in its notice
of proposed rule-making.

The USDA argues that point-of-origin treatment may give Mexican exporters a
marketing advantage, because restrictions on U.S. movements would be lifted.
Brokers in the United States could import mangoes and re-export the shipment to
Canada with little difficulty. The downside would be increased costs to
exporters or shippers, and some packing houses in Mexico do not have the
water-treatment facilities.

Requiring insect-proof cartons would eliminate the need for water treatment and
thus save money. Sealed and screened cartons, however, would increase costs for
shippers, importers and exporters.

The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service compiled statistics that show U.S.
imports of fresh mangoes from Mexico last year were valued at nearly $ 81.6
million. The United States imported $ 37.9 million worth of mangoes in the first
five months of this year.

According to Statistics Canada in Ottawa, for the first six months of 1995,
imports of guavas, mangoes and mangosteens totalled just under C$ 9.9 million
(US$ 7.3 million). For all of 1994, those imports totalled C$ 1.15 billion.

Breakdowns for Canada's mango imports alone were not immediately available,
although fresh mangoes are believed to be the bulk of that import
classification.

Mexican agriculture ministry spokesman Crecencio Cardenas declined to provide
Mexico's export data.

Small but Voracious Beetle Threatens Chicago's Trees

BYLINE: By The New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Page 37; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 591 words

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 31


A small, black, tree-killing beetle, first detected in New York more than two
years ago, has found its way to Chicago, where agriculture officials say it has
infested hundreds of trees. It is only the second known infestation in the
United States.

The bug, the Asian long-horned beetle, or Anoplophora glabripennis, was
discovered here in July by a resident of the Ravenswood neighborhood on the
north side of the city. Since confirming the identity of the beetle, which had
previously been seen only in New York, officials from the United States
Department of Agriculture, Illinois Department of Agriculture and the city's
Forestry Department have found almost 300 infested trees, all of which are to be
destroyed this winter.

A quarantine area of more than 15 square miles has been set up, and officials
like Joe McCarthy, a city forester now devoted full time to the beetle watch,
are going after the little black bug.

"This particular beetle can be devastating to an urban environment," Mr.
McCarthy said. "And if it's not eradicated, there is a potential threat to the
national forest system."

The authorities believe that the beetles are imported in raw wooden packing
material from China. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has required that all
material imported from China be treated before being shipped to the United
States. The rule, which will take effect on Dec. 17, has created some tension
with Chinese trade officials who do not believe that the beetle's emergence has
been positively linked to their country. But Mr. McCarthy said the authorities
had found the local source: a hardware manufacturing company in Ravenswood that
imports heavy material in wooden crates from China.

This particular beetle, unlike several of its cousins, actually eats live wood,
causing irreparable damage to trees, officials said.

In their several-week adult lifespan, female beetles can lay more than 30 eggs,
placing each into a hole chewed in the bark of a tree. After hatching, usually
in the summer or fall, the larva begins boring deep into the tree until it
reaches the heartwood, where it would be safe from pesticides. By late spring, a
grown adult burrows its way back out of the tree creating a hole a half-inch in
diameter, and renewing the process.

The only way to fight the beetle, experts say, is to cut down the tree in the
winter before adult beetles emerge, and burn the wood.

Mr. McCarthy said the beetles tended to prefer maple, elm, willow and chestnut
trees, so the city plans to replace those trees primarily with basswoods and
ginkgoes, which the beetles are known to stay away from.

Mr. McCarthy said that the process of fighting the beetles was a long one, and
that once destruction of the infested trees was completed, inspectors would
start the process all over again. "We're hoping this is about a five-year
process," he said.

Chicago officials feel they caught the problem relatively early; in New York the
beetle is believed to have had three to four years to spread before it was
detected, in Brooklyn. Since the discovery of the beetle in 1996, more than
2,400 trees have been destroyed, said Joe Gittleman, the project manager in New
York.

He said that additional sightings had been made on Long Island and in Queens and
that the fight, more than two years later, was continuing.

"You hope something like this never happens," said Mr. Gittleman, who has been
in contact with Chicago officials to swap information and offer advice. He
added, "We're doing everything we can to fight it."

Ensure that farmers have fair living wage

BYLINE: JERRY PENNICK, HEATHER GRAY; For the Journal-Constitution

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 687 words


In 1999, black farmers in the United States reached a $2.8 billion settlement
with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a class-action discrimination
lawsuit. But the problems are ongoing. In fact, under various farm bills and
trade agreements, discrimination has expanded to farmers throughout the world.

Most farmers in the world are, in fact, people of color, from Africa to Asia to
the Americas.

Abuse of the agriculture program was rampant in the American South in the past
century. Examples abound.

Early in the 20th century, cotton plantation owners convinced the U.S.
Department of Agriculture that allotment payments should be filtered through
them, rather than go directly to their black tenant farmers or sharecroppers.
This resulted in as little money as possible going to those farming the land. It
set a pattern of abuse.

We've seen in recent years Farm Service Agency county supervisors totally
disregard loan applications from black farmers. Information about farm programs
is not always made available to black farmers. If loans are approved, the
payments often come too late to plant the season's crops. County committees that
determine farm loan qualifications often lack black representation.

The United States now wants to expand these devastating discriminatory policies
throughout the developing world. The subsidy commodity program is a prime
example. Congress and corporations wanted to increase U.S. exports so they
lowered the guaranteed minimum price for U.S. commodities such as cotton.

Prior to this devastating legislation, farmers were guaranteed a minimum price
that was close to the cost of production. No more. Congress also stopped the
acreage set-aside program, under which cotton farmers were paid not to plant on
some of their land. This opened up an additional 10 million to 14 million acres
into production, some of which went into cotton.

Without regulations that set a fair price, corporations can purchase cotton
below the cost of production in the United States, driving down prices in the
developing world. And the higher production has increased demand for chemicals
and seeds. It's been a corporate windfall.

So where are farmers in this picture? Because there are virtually no regulations
to offer a fair price for commodities, the government pays farmers a subsidy to
make up for their loss. It usually just barely covers the cost of production.
Black farmers and small family farmers in the United States depend on subsidies
in an attempt to break even.

In a recent survey of African-American cotton farmers we conducted throughout
the Southeast, it was found that the subsidy program is essential for their
survival. But when asked if subsidies would be as important if the farmers
received a fair price for their cotton, the answer was "no."

The subsidy program is a scapegoat for failed agriculture and development
policies that are bolstered by the World Trade Organization, International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank that force the governments of developing
countries out of agriculture. This enables corporations to control the global
agriculture system.

World governments should instead be encouraged to create an agricultural system
that supports small farmers and protects borders through fair trade and not free
trade.

Policies that would go a long way toward resolving the current corporate
agriculture welfare system would include a "Farmer Living Wage Program" so that
corporations would have to pay a fair price to farmers and supply management
that would reinstitute the acreage set-aside program.

We believe farmers in the United States and all over the world would benefit
from these reforms.

With these recommendations, the United States would be taking the lead in
defining the role of government in agriculture and moving the debate toward the
establishment of an "International Living Wage" policy for farmers. Food and
fiber are far too important to be left in the hands of the private sector.

Ban on Argentine citrus may soon be lifted * * * USDA proposal would open
markets

BYLINE: BY BETH RUBENSTEIN

SECTION: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 543 words

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES


Argentina, the world's second-largest lemon grower after the United States, is
anxiously awaiting a U.S. regulatory review that may allow a wider opening of
sales to the vast U.S. market.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has proposed lifting a ban on the import of
citrus fruits grown in the northwest region of Argentina. Imports of fresh
lemons, grapefruit and oranges from that region have been prohibited.

The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined the
provinces of Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta and Tucuman are free of citrus canker - a
highly contagious disease that destroys trees and damages fruit. The disease is
said to be carried on the fruit's skin.

Under the Aphis proposal, Argentina's citrus fruits imported by the United
States must follow strict regulations and guidelines that include a 150 meter
(495-feet) zone to separate citrus groves from agriculture or non-agriculture
areas; treatments against other diseases - such as black spot, sweet orange
scab, and fruit flies - and a certificate saying that growers complied with the
rules.

Aphis operates under a mandate of lifting U.S. import bans on foreign
agricultural products when a scientific analysis reveals no risk to the U.S.
crop. Such determinations give Aphiis added credibility when negotiating to open
foreign markets to U.S. farm products.

Aphis needs such credibility because as tariff levels fall under global
commitments, non- tariff barriers including bans based on alleged diseases in
the supplying countries often replace them. Aphis took a big step last year in
opening the U.S. market to Mexican avocados in the face of huge opposition from
U.S. growers in Southern California.

The first step toward lifting the ban came in early August when Aphis sought a
90-day public comment period. That process will be followed by an Aphis and
Department of Agriculture review of public comment.

Aphis sought comment to determine whether the Argentine fruit can receive a
permit to be shipped into the United States under guidelines of the Federal
Plant Pest Act, and to determine if additional risk-mitigation measures are
needed.

The United States would import an estimated 5,000 to 25,000 metric tons annually
if the ban were lifted, with the actual amount depending on the fruit's
condition, said Gary Groves, the agriculture counselor at the U.S. Embassy in
Buenos Aires. The majority exported would be lemons, he said.

Absent stiff opposition, the lifting of the ban could come later this year or
early next year.

""Unless the ban causes a major stir or the public disapproves the proposal, it
is usually a done deal,'' Mr. Groves said.

San Miguel Agriciyf, one of the world's largest lemon producers located in
Argentina, has for years lobbied to gain access to the vast U.S. market. If the
ban is lifted, said a company spokesman, the company's growth rate would almost
double. The spokesman added that current sales to the United States are
estimated at $30 million.

U.S. citrus prices are roughly three times those in Europe and Argentina.
Currently, 80 percent of Argentina's exports go to Europe, South Africa and
Asia.

The two largest lemon producers globally are said to be the United States and
Argentina.

Washington: CBP Agriculture Specialists in Miami Ensure Flowers are Pest Free
for Valentine's Day

LENGTH: 374  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 Flowers are the most popular gift item during Valentine's Day celebrations, but
they could also be the hiding place for dangerous insects and diseases. U.S.
Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) highly trained agriculture specialists at
Miami International Airport spend numerous hours inspecting cut flower imports
to ensure that these are pest free.





 Miami International Airport ranks first among United States ports of entry for
shipments of cut flower imports, followed by Los Angeles.  Miami Agriculture Air
Cargo operations leads all United States airports with 88 percent of fresh-cut
flowers and 74 percent of fresh fruits and vegetables imported into the United
States every year.



 "CBP here in Miami plays a vital role during Valentine's Day celebrations.  Our
agriculture specialists work tirelessly to ensure that hitchhiking pests are
intercepted before reaching your homes and your loved ones.  The economic
ramifications of allowing harmful and destructive pests into our county can be
devastating to the United States flower industry," said Miami International
Airport Port Director Christopher D. Maston.



 During the 2016 Valentine's season:



     CBP agriculture specialists in Miami processed approximately 524,006,741
stems of cut flowers during the peak season of January 24, 2016 to February 14,
2016.

     The imported cut flowers inspection process resulted in 1,806 pest
interceptions in Miami.  The most common type of plant pests intercepted in cut
flower imports are Noctuidae (Moths), Aphididae (Aphids), Frankliniella sp.
(Thrips), and Tetranychus sp. (Mites).

     On an average day, CBP agriculture specialists intercept approximately 58
plant pest interceptions from products of agriculture concern. During the 2016
peak season, CBP agriculture specialists in Miami intercepted approximately 82
plant pests each day from cut flowers.

     The flowers mainly come from Colombia, which exports nearly 700 million
flowers to the US for Valentine's Day, followed by Ecuador, Mexico, the
Netherlands and Costa Rica.

U.S. Companies Largely Back Trade Decisions;
Agricultural Trade

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA

SECTION: Section C; Column 3; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 227 words


American agriculture officials said they were pleased with the outcome of W.T.O.
meetings because it meant members of the group were prepared to move toward
reductions of tariffs and other barriers to agricultural trade.

The United States, the largest exporter of agricultural goods, has long been
frustrated by high tariffs and other trade barriers in Europe, the Pacific Rim
and elsewhere.

While American farmers are highly subsidized for production at home, they get
less export assistance than farmers in many other countries and the United
States does not impose high duties on agricultural imports.

"This will give American farmers greater access to world markets," said Tim
Hume, head of the National Corn Growers Association. "It's important because
agriculture products face an average of 60 percent tariffs abroad."

The talks in Qatar do not signal a clear victory for United States agriculture
because they are only the beginning of a process. They do, however, indicate
that member countries would like to move toward a more liberal and open
marketplace for food. Some companies are likely to be particularly big
beneficiaries of trade liberalization in agriculture: Cargill and Archer Daniels
Midland, the grain exporters, and Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods, meat
producers and processors. And farmers could see some higher prices.   DAVID

CALGARY - A bigger wheat harvest in the United States will feed demands for a $
9-billion (US) bailout package this year for farmers south of the border, but
Ottawa and the provinces are not expected to increase payments to farmers here.

Record winter wheat yields, a result of mild weather and ample rain, caused the
United States Department of Agriculture to boost its forecast of the total
domestic wheat harvest to 2.33-billion bushels, up almost 4% from a month ago.
With global grain stocks already bulging, a bumper crop in the United States
will put further pressure on wheat prices.

The report will be fodder for advocates pushing for financial aid that equals or
exceeds last year's $5.9-billion package.

In Canada, Ottawa and the provinces have agreed to pump $1.5-billion over two
years to help livestock and crop producers hurting from weak demand and
languishing prices. The Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the country's
largest lobby group, recently criticized the federal government for not doing
enough to help agricultural operators through the toughest time in more than a
decade.

US to provide 100m dollars for agriculture development in Pakistan, Afghanistan

LENGTH: 799 words


Text of report by official news agency Associated Press of Pakistan (APP)

Islamabad, 12 February: A trilateral US-Pakistan-Afghanistan forum on
agriculture has made a robust start in its first meeting held in Qatar with
United States making initial commitment of 100m dollars as first tranche out of
a hefty fund it promised to bolster agriculture in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
"More money will flow as concrete projects get underway," US deputy under
secretary agriculture Burnham Philbrooke observed in the plenary session.
According to a message received here Friday [12 February], the meeting was
organized in Doha by the US Embassy in Pakistan for security reason and to avoid
visa and other complications envisaged in holding it in the United States.
Pakistan delegation that comprised nearly two dozen top agriculture experts and
officials was led by the director general of the trilateral secretariat, Mr
Zahoor Malik. Working groups comprising experts from the three countries in
their deliberations focused on areas of food security, trade corridors and water
management. Malik announced that the next meeting of the forum will be held in
Pakistan in April.

Pakistan voiced its concerns on the dam being built on River Kabul with India's
assistance and suggested a profound engagement between Pakistan and Afghanistan
to address these concerns. Philbrooke said development of agriculture in both
countries was part of the strategy to boosting their economies, uplifting living
standards of their people and winning the hearts and minds of the rural
populace. "We believe that peace depends on improving the lot of the people for
which development of agriculture is vital because more than eighty per cent
population depends on it," Philbrooke remarked. He said the United States
intends to vigorously pursue the goal of agricultural growth adding that in case
of Afghanistan it would also work as an incentive to farmers to stop planting
poppy.

"Agriculture is key to making peace sustainable" Philbrooke said while pointing
out that drug trade is a major source of instability and funding for militancy
in Afghanistan. Responding to points raised by Mr. Malik in his welcome speech
regarding the tardy approach adopted by the United States in the past in
committing funds that has hampered progress in formulating policies and
designing projects, Philbrooke assured that adequate and prompt funding would be
provided to launch viable programmes in agriculture. He said the US secretary
agriculture during his recent visit to the region felt more determined than ever
to build international awareness about the importance of Afghanistan's
agricultural economy to its long-term security and sustainability. He referred
to last year's trilateral summit in Washington attended by president Barack
Obama and his Afghan and Pakistani counterparts Hamed Karazi and Asif Ali Zadari
during which they agreed on a roadmap for the progress and prosperity of people
of this region. "We, too, are here in the midst of a great challenge and
understand that generating sustained economic development in Pakistan and
Afghanistan will not be easy. But we will not be deterred."

Malik said the United States has been a generous donor to developing countries
in promoting their economies but its assistance has failed to produce desired
results.

"In this context we hear our American friends expressing frustration why people
hate America despite all the goodwill it has shown in helping the developing
countries," Malik said.

"One major reason for this state of affairs is that the US assistance has failed
to trickle down to real stake-holders- the under-privileged sections of society
who have become poorer over the period of time," he said.

"In order to move in the right direction, we have to acknowledge our past
mistakes and stop enriching the rich and empowering the powerful, "Malik said
adding: "People are sceptical and there is also a trust deficit as people are
not sure if the Americans would again wash off their hands, as in the past, and
leave everything high and dry."

Philbrooke said the United States and its allies are determined this time not to
abandon the people of this region and would do everything to become their
partners in peace and prosperity. Afghan deputy minister Saleem Kundozi said his
government's agricultural strategy has three pillars; to protect and restore the
environment; to grow agricultural production and productivity; and to foster
agri-business to boost exports and family income for creating new jobs on and
off the farms. He underpinned the importance of cooperation between Afghanistan
and Pakistan and said his country can learn from the broader experiences of
Pakistan.

US EDGES TOWARDS OPENING BORDER WITH CANADA TO LIVE CATTLE TRADE

SECTION: 1st Edition; NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 267 words


AGRICULTURE and Agri-Food Minister, Bob Speller, said the US had taken another
major step in the process of reopening the border to live Canadian cattle and
other ruminants.

The United States Department of Agriculture will re-open the comment period on a
rule that would amend regulations regarding the importation of animals and
animal products from countries - including Canada - with a minimal risk of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).

If finalised, the rule would allow certain classes of live Canadian cattle and
other ruminants to be imported into the United States for the first time since
May 20, 2003.

"This is good news," said Mr Speller. "The US has set things in motion again and
it's our hope that the process moves quickly and that the border reopens as soon
as possible."

Mr Speller is also encouraged by the possibility of movement on products made
from cattle older than 30 months. He noted that, since Canada and the US had
ensured Specified Risk Materials were prevented from entering the human food
chain, there was no reason to restrict trade in older animals or their products.

"There would be no greater risk of BSE in the United States if the border was
opened to live cattle," said Mr Speller. "The science supports this assertion
and we have every reason to expect the United States will continue to recognize
this fact as this process moves forward."

Mr Speller stressed that he had been in close contact with US Secretary, Ann
Veneman, on this issue and thanked her for moving quickly for the good of
industries on both sides of the border.

SCIENCE WATCH;
Radar Spots Insects

SECTION: Section C; Page 4, Column 2; Science Desk

LENGTH: 182 words


Scientists have long known that insect pests often travel vast distances before
dropping down to prey on farm crops. But the researchers have lacked details
needed to predict massive migrations.

Recent experiments in Tifton, Ga., by a team of scientists of the United States
Department of Agriculture Research Service indicate, however, that modern radar
can detect such mass flights, and hope to use the technology in pest control.
The researchers also find that radar can can give estimates of the number of
insects in flight. Some of the larger insects, such as the corn earworm, can be
tracked more than a mile away from the radar site.

The scientific team says it can can determine the origin of the insect flights
and predict where they may land next. Meteorologists, using data from weather
charts and balloons, provide recordings of wind and temperature conditions while
entomologists add their knowledge of the insect behavior. The scientists hope to
be able soon to identify specific species seen on thee radar.

WASHINGTON:One of the Best Fields for New College Graduates? Agriculture.

LENGTH: 578  words

DATELINE: Palouse Grain Growers


Palouse Grain Growers, The State of Washington has issued the following news
release:

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a new report showing
tremendous demand for recent college graduates with a degree in agricultural
programs with an estimated 57,900 high-skilled job openings annually in the
food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and environment fields in the
United States. According to an employment outlook report released today by
USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Purdue University,
there is an average of 35,400 new U.S. graduates with a bachelor's degree or
higher in agriculture related fields, 22,500 short of the jobs available
annually.

"There is incredible opportunity for highly-skilled jobs in agriculture," said
Secretary Vilsack. "Those receiving degrees in agricultural fields can expect to
have ample career opportunities. Not only will those who study agriculture be
likely to get well-paying jobs upon graduation, they will also have the
satisfaction of working in a field that addresses some of the world's most
pressing challenges. These jobs will only become more important as we continue
to develop solutions to feed more than 9 billion people by 2050."

The report projects almost half of the job opportunities will be in management
and business. Another 27 percent will be in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) areas. Jobs in food and biomaterials production will make
up 15 percent, and 12 percent of the openings will be in education,
communication, and governmental services. The report also shows that women make
up more than half of the food, agriculture, renewable natural resources, and
environment higher education graduates in the United States.

Other highlights of the reportThis is an external link or third-party site
outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. include:

While most employers prefer to hire graduates of food, agriculture, renewable
natural resources, and environment programs, graduates from these programs only
fill about 60 percent of the expected annual openings. Even as enrollments in
these programs increase and the job market becomes somewhat more competitive,
good employment opportunities for the next five years are expected.
    Growth in job opportunities will be uneven. Employers in some areas will
struggle to find enough graduates to fill jobs. In a few areas, employers will
find an oversupply of job seekers.
    Expect to see a strong employment market for e-commerce managers and
marketing agents, ecosystem managers, agricultural science and business
educators, crop advisors, and pest control specialists.
    Job opportunities in STEM areas are expected to grow. Expect the strongest
job market for plant scientists, food scientists, sustainable biomaterials
specialists, water resources scientists and engineers, precision agriculture
specialists, and veterinarians.

The report, Employment Opportunities for College Graduates in Food, Agriculture,
Renewable Natural Resources, and the Environment, United States, 2015-2020This
is an external link or third-party site outside of the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) website., is the eighth in a series of five-year
projections initiated by USDA in 1980. The report was produced by Purdue
University with grant support from NIFA.

Washington: CBP Preclearance in Shannon, Ireland Welcomes New Agriculture Canine
Enforcement Team

LENGTH: 468  words

DATELINE: Washington


Customs and Border Protection, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently welcomed a new agriculture canine
enforcement team to the Preclearance facility in Shannon, Ireland. "Kingston," a
two-year-old beagle, arrived in Ireland in early August and was reunited with
his handler, CBP Agriculture Specialist (CBPAS) Thanuja Hall. Shannon, Ireland
is the only preclearance facility with an agriculture canine team.
CBP Agriculture Specialist Thanuja Hall and Kingston at the National Detector
Dog Training Center.

Dog Training Center.

"Kingston and I are excited to be the first line in defending American
agriculture from harmful pests and disease prior to them entering the U.S. as
the only agriculture canine team at a Preclearance facility," said CBPAS Hall.
"Being a part of a canine detection team is not only one of the greatest jobs
there is at CBP, but it is also one of the most important."

The more than 116 CBP agriculture canine teams at ports of entry, land borders
and mail facilities are the front line in the fight against the introduction of
harmful insects and disease into the United States. Every pest or disease
intercepted could cause million in damages to U.S. agriculture. CBP agriculture
specialists' vigilance helps protect America's farms, forests and natural
resources.

"We are very pleased to have CBP Agriculture Specialist Hall and her K-9 partner
Kingston on board here in Shannon Preclearance," said (Acting) Port Director
Gregory Starr. "The CBP agriculture mission is an integral part of our
processing and we are extremely fortunate to have this canine team asset at our
Preclearance location."

Prior to arriving in Ireland, the team completed a mandatory U.S. Department of
Agriculture training at the National Detector Dog Training Center (USDA NDDTC)
in Georgia. All the detector canines at USDA NDDTC are adopted from rescue
shelters in the U.S., like Kingston was, or gifted through private donations.
CBPAS Hall joined CBP in 2005 and became a canine handler in 2007.

CBP Preclearance operations allow for advance inspection of passengers and
special coordination with law enforcement upon arrival in the United States.
Through preclearance, the same immigration, customs, and agriculture inspections
of international air passengers performed on arrival in the United States are
instead completed before departure at foreign airports.  Currently, preclearance
operations exist at 15 foreign airports in six different countries, benefitting
air passengers, airports, and air carriers, in the United States and abroad.

Help pledged to beef industry

BYLINE: SIMON TUCK, With a report from Canadian Press

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 355 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


Ottawa and the provinces hope to announce a plan to compensate struggling beef
producers before the end of this week, Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said
yesterday.

When asked if the relief package would be worth $100-million, as reported in
Saturday's Globe and Mail, Mr. Vanclief said an announcement could be made
within days.

"We are working on a program with the provinces," Mr. Vanclief told CTV's
Question Period. "I'm confident that in the not-too-distant future that we'll be
making some support there."

Meanwhile, Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Yukio Hattori, will ask the United
States to ban the exportation of Canadian beef bound for Japan via the United
States, according to media sources in Tokyo.

According to the sources, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries will be requesting the United States to start certifying the origin of
all its beef products intended for export to ensure that nothing has come from
Canada.

Under the current U.S. certification system, which started in September, only
the location at which the animals are slaughtered is certified.

Talking to CTV, Mr. Vanclief also confirmed that the support program would be a
60-40 split between the two levels of government, with Ottawa picking up the
larger chunk of the bill.

Government sources have said the money will be designed to help cattle producers
reduce the size of their herds.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Friday that it is ready to start
accepting imports of live Canadian cattle under 30 months of age because they
are seen to be at less risk of bringing bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad-cow disease, into the United States.

Mr. Vanclief said there's still plenty of work to be done. "We still have a
problem with older animals."

But Washington will take until Jan. 4 to gather opinions from the U.S. industry
and the public about the proposal before the border is officially opened.

U.S. officials have refused to say how long it might be after that before the
border is completely open, saying that it depends on what people say during the
information-gathering period.

Agricultural Output Climbed in 2013, Recovering From Drought

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; OFF THE CHARTS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 492 words


AGRICULTURE is a small part of the United States economy, but last year it was
the best part.

The output of the agriculture sector grew 16.4 percent after inflation last
year, the fastest rise for the sector since at least 1998 and far faster than
any other part of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product grew just 1.8
percent, while the second-fastest growing sector, the information industry, rose
3.2 percent.

Last week, the government released its estimates of state economic growth in
2013. North Dakota led the pack with a growth rate of 9.7 percent. Alaska was
the only state whose economy declined, shrinking by 2.1 percent, largely because
of declining oil production.

The economy of the District of Columbia also declined, but that was because of
cuts in government spending.

North Dakota benefited from its rising production of shale oil, but it was also
helped by the fact that its agriculture sector amounts to 12.9 percent of the
state's economy, more than that of any other state except South Dakota.

By contrast, agriculture accounted for just 1.6 percent of the country's overall
output in 2013. But that was the largest share in recent years, up from a recent
low of 0.9 percent in 2006. The agriculture sector includes forestry, fishing
and hunting as well as farming, but farming is much larger than the other
categories.

Last year, the government changed the way it calculated G.D.P. figures,
including counting research and development spending as investments rather than
as consumption. It revised historical figures only back to 1997, so earlier
years' output and growth figures for agriculture are not comparable.

Mitch Morehart, an economist with the Agriculture Department, said the strong
growth in agriculture reflected a recovery in production for some crops after a
drought in 2012, as well as strong production and rising prices for livestock.
This year, he said, it appears that agriculture is not doing nearly as well.

Over all, the economies of the 10 states that are most dependent on agriculture
grew at an average annual rate of 3.4 percent in 2013, while the 10 states that
are least dependent on the farm economy grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent.

California is by far the largest agricultural producer, accounting for $46.7
billion, or 17 percent, of the total national agricultural output of $269.1
billion. But the state is so large that agriculture makes up only 2.1 percent of
its output, less than 16 other states. Iowa, which ranks second in dollar value
at $16.1 billion, depends on agriculture for almost 10 percent of its total
economic output.

The 2013 surge in agriculture ended a string of three years in which that sector
did not do as well as the overall United States economy. But since 1998,
agriculture outperformed the rest of the economy in nine of the 15 years. During
that stretch, agriculture grew at an annual rate of 4 percent, double the 2
percent average for the national economy.

last 16 years. States most  dependent on agriculture generally grew more rapidly
in 2013 than did states with smaller agricultural sectors. (Source: Bureau of

PAYMENT TO GULF BANK QUESTIONED IN SENATE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 685 words


WASHINGTON - Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., asked the Agriculture Department
onMonday to explain why it paid more than $360 million to a Persian Gulf bank
that is partly owned by Iraq, despite a ban on U.S. aid to Iraq.  Leahy asked
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan to explain the payments to the Gulf
International Bank - made after President George Bush banned business with Iraq.
The bank is owned by Iraq and six other Persian Gulf governments.  ''At a time
when we are all concerned that the government of Iraq continues to act in an
outlaw fashion under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, I am very concerned that
this payment sends a dangerous signal to the government of Iraq,'' Leahy told
Madigan in a letter.  A spokesman for the Agriculture Department declined to
comment.  Leahy's Agriculture Committee and the House Banking Committee are
planning investigations of the extension of loan guarantees. The United States
made the payments to Gulf International Bank to honor government-backed loans on
which Iraq had defaulted after its invasion of Kuwait, T he Los Angeles Times
reported Sunday.  According to Leahy's letter, representatives of the bank have
confirmed that it is administered by the Ministry of Finance of Iraq and six
other Middle Eastern governments - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates.  The U.S. government made loan guarantees in the
1980s and early 1990 to entice Persian Gulf banks to advance Iraq money to buy
American farm products. The U.S. government had guaranteed a total of $5 billion
in credits. Iraq has defaulted on $2 billion since the invasion of Kuwait.
Agriculture Department records obtained by the Times and The Associated Press
show that the Gulf International Bank was one of 10 banks getting restitution
from the first $1 billion in payments from the Commodity Credit Corp., an
Agriculture Department agency. In his letter, Leahy asked Madigan to explain
''why these funds were paid to a bank controlled in substantial part by the
government of Iraq.'' Abdel-Fattah Tahoun, a Gulf International officer in New
York, told the Times that the bank had adhered to Bush's order banning payments
to Iraq.  Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department
decided last year not to indict a Jordanian businessman in a $5 billion Iraqi
loan fraud scheme after the State Department pointed out that he was ''well
connected'' to King Hussein of Jordan and to U.S. grain exporters. The Post
cited records made public Monday in the House.  Government prosecutors had been
planning to name the middleman, Wafai Dajani, as one of the defendants in a
conspiracy to funnel billions of dollars in illegal bank loans to Iraq but
decided not to do so shortly before the indictment was returned on Feb. 28, 1991
- the day allied forces were ordered to stop fighting in the Persian Gulf War,
the Post reported.  In a secret internal memo that day, the State Department
said it had ''no objections'' to indictment of any of the individuals on the
prosecution's list, including Dajani, but it expressed reservations about
proceeding against him in light of his connections.  Iraq received more than $5
billion worth of what the government says were ''unauthorized 'off book' loans
and credit commitments'' from the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banco Nazionale del
Lavoro between 1985 and 1989, including about $900 million guaranteed by the
Commodity Credit Corp.  Shelling Reported In apparent violation of the
cease-fire agreement signed after the Persian Gulf War, Iraqi military forces
are shelling and shooting at thousands of Kurdish civilians along their front
lines in northern Iraq, The New York Times reported today.  The attacks, against
about a dozen small villages and towns along the Great Zab River, have forced
the entire population of 40,000 people to flee their homes since Wednesday,
according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  The Cox News
Service reported that five divisions of Iraqi troops have massed against lightly
armed Kurdish fighters at Irbil in northern Iraq.

HEALTH/FOOD;
EATING SENSIBLY

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

SECTION: Section 6; Page 70, Column 3; Magazine Desk

LENGTH: 1033 words


President Reagan has endorsed the Federal Dietary Guidelines for the United
States, which may have come as something of a surprise to his Secretary of
Agriculture, John R. Block.

Ever since Mr. Block took office, he and other Reagan Administration appointees
in the United States Department of Agriculture have played down the importance
of these guidelines.  Certain segments of the food industry, egg and dairy
producers, for example, oppose them because they suggest changes in American
eating habits that, if followed, could cut down on the consumption of the
foodstuffs they provide.

Before the Reagan Administration took office, the U.S.D.A. sent copies of the
dietary guidelines, at no cost, to anyone who wrote and asked for them.  Over
eight million were requested.  Now, however, the department says it should not
be in the business of giving advice about nutrition.  Yet, the guidelines offer
the same advice as the President follows.  They contain seven principles
designed to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease:

Eat a variety of foods.

Maintain ideal weight.

Avoid too much fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.

Eat foods with adequate starch and fiber.

Avoid too much sugar.

Avoid too much sodium.

If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation.

According to a recent article in Parade Magazine that carries his byline, such
as diet is part of the President's total physical-fitness program, which also
includes indoor and outdoor exercise.

Writing about his diet, Mr. Reagan said: ''The key here is moderation...For
example, at breakfast I pass up the pancakes and sausage in favor of cereal and
fruit, skim milk and decaffeinated coffee.  For lunch, I usually have soup and a
salad.''

The evening meal is fish, chicken or meat with fresh vegetables and a salad of
some sort.  And, the President said, he saves some of his calories for dessert.
On days when he has a big lunch, he cuts down on dinner.

Mr. Reagan also said he had ''broken the salt habit.''

Health professionals believe that such a diet not only reduces the risk of
cardiovascular disease but is ''likely to also reduce the risk of cancer,''
according to the National Academy of Sciences.  In the academy's report, ''Diet,
Nutrition and Cancer,'' which was published in June 1982, recommendations
similar to those in the Dietary Guidelines were made.  They differ in two
respects: The academy did not find any evidence that saturated fat is more
likely to cause cancer than unsaturated fat and it offered no advice about
cholesterol consumption.

The report, however, is more specific than the Dietary Guidelines about other
foods: Even though it made no recommendations about the protective effects of
fiber, it emphasized the importance of high-fiber, whole-grain cereal products.
And it recommended severe restrictions on the consumption of saltcured foods,
including saltpickled and smoked foods.

Adhering to the recommendations by choosing from the following categories of
food for daily meal plans is not difficult--as long as you are ready to make the
changes.

Fruits and vegetables: Six or more servings daily of fruits and vegetables.  A
serving is one piece of fresh fruit and one-half cup of frozen, and one-half cup
of raw or cooked vegetables.

Especially desirable fruits and vegetables are mango, papaya, cantaloupe,
watermelon, strawberries, citrus fruits, broccoli, spinach, kale, escarole,
romaine lettuce, parsley, peppers, cabbage, white potatoes, sweet potatoes,
carrots, acorn squash, butternut squash and brussels sprouts.

Whole grains and cereals: Five servings of whole grains.  Two slices of bread,
two muffins or half a cup of cooked cereal grain constitute one serving.
Whole-grain products include whole-wheat bread, brown rice, corn and cornmeal,
wheat germ, bran, barley, buckwheat groats, bulgur and oatmeal.

Protein-rich foods: Two to three servings of low-fat dairy products, lean fish,
meat, poultry or eggs and beans or nuts.  A cup of skim milk, an ounce and
one-half of cheese or a cup of low-fat yogurt equals a serving.

Two or three ounces of boneless fish, meat or poultry or one egg equals one
serving.  Trim exterior fat from meat; choose meat with little marbling; eat
white-meat chicken and turkey; remove skin.  Up to a cup of cooked beans or a
quarter of a cup of nuts makes one serving.

Occasionals: In addition to oil, butter and margarine, foods high in fat include
mayonnaise, salad dressings, rich desserts and fried or creamed foods.

Pork chops with apple, cabbage and cumin

4 thin pork chops

1 tart green or red apple, cored and thinly sliced

1/2 pound red or green cabbage, thinly sliced

1 small onion, thinly sliced

2 to 3 teaspoons ground cumin seed

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Freshly ground black pepper to taste.

1. In a heavy skillet, brown the chops in their own fat on both sides over
medium-high heat.  When the chops are brown, remove them from the skillet.  Pour
off all but one tablespoon of fat.

2. Add the apple, cabbage, onion, cumin, lemon juice and pepper.  Return the
chops to the skillet and cook, covered, until the chops are tender and the
vegetables are soft.  Stir occasionally.  Total cooking time is about 25
minutes.

Yield: Two servings.

Bulgur with garlic and parsley 1/2 cup bulgur

1 tablespoon butter

1 cup chicken stock or water

1/4 teaspoon minced garlic

1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley.

1. In a skillet, saute the bulgur in hot butter for about two minutes.  Add the
stock, cover, and cook until the bulgur is tender and the liquid has evaporated,
about 10 minutes.

2. Stir in the garlic and parsley, and cook another minute or two.

Yield: Two servings.

Zucchini and vermouth

2 to 3 medium zucchini, scrubbed and coarsely grated

1 tablespoon olive oil

1 to 2 splashes dry vermouth

Freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Taiwan Suspends Imports of U.S. Apples

LENGTH: 186 words

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 22


Taiwan suspended apple imports from the United States on Wednesday after
discovering moth larvae in shipments from three states, the agriculture ministry
said.

Codling moth larvae were found during inspections of cargoes from Washington and
California in September and October, and in produce from Oregon on Monday, said
Vincent Ko, an official at the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health and Quarantine.

''The U.S. must now prepare an investigation report and a report on measures for
improvement,'' Mr. Ko said. The United States is Taiwan's largest supplier of
apples.

Once that has been completed to Taiwan's satisfaction, the ban can be lifted,
Mr. Ko said, adding that there was no fixed timetable for when that might
happen.

The United States has not responded to the suspension, Mr. Ko said.

Taiwan relies on imports to meet more than 90 percent of its apple demand,
according to the United States Agriculture Department.

Taiwan has imported about 108,255 metric tons of apples so far this year, with
the United States accounting for about 52 percent of the market.

Brazilian commodities market not concerned about El Niqo_

SECTION: Front Page

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, 10/13/97


The Brazilian commodities market in agricultural products is relatively stable
and apparently is unconcerned about any risk to food crops due to the effects of
the 'El Niqo' phenomenon, said Flavio Franca Junior, of the consulting firm
Safras & Mercados.

"The relative clam of the market in terms of the Brazilian food crops is the
best indicator that the market is not assuming there will be negative effects in
the country due to El Niqo." His opinion is supported by forecasts of the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In its most recent monthly report on
world agricultural products, which was released last Friday, USDA predicted that
there would be record crops in Brazil and Argentina, as well as in the United
States. The principal problem of agriculture is not the excess of water, but a
scarcity of water, climate specialists pointed out. (Gazeta Mercantil) (SB)

REFORMING FARM SUBSIDIES IS TOUGH ROW TO HOE

BYLINE: By Sara F. Cooper Guest Columnist

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Sara F. Cooper guest column; Pg. A05

LENGTH: 795 words


When Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns, whom President Bush has just nominated to be
the next secretary of agriculture, takes office, his first order of business
should be pushing for an end to America's drastically distorted farm subsidy
programs.

Eliminating U.S. farm subsidies would dramatically reduce government spending,
end a program that mostly benefits corporate interests and the wealthy,
strengthen U.S. agriculture, give us needed leverage in international trade
negotiations, and allow the United States to extricate itself from the
embarrassing practice of undermining its own foreign-aid program.

The United States made $17 billion in direct government payments to farmers and
ranchers in 2003 - amounting to 32 percent of net farm income. On top of this
were additional billions in indirect assistance, delivered via subsidized loans
and insurance, loan guarantees and tax breaks.

IF THE FARM lobby's argument that such largesse is necessary to preserve the
family farm ever applied, it doesn't now. According to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, about 40 percent of all farms receive government payments of some
kind. The bulk of these payments, however, go to larger farms. In fact, while
just 7 percent of all U.S. farms have sales of $250,000 or more, this 7 percent
receive almost half of all government payments.

How could a domestic aid program become so distorted?

The reason is simple: Eligibility for farm subsidies is determined by crop, not
by income or poverty standards. Growers of corn, wheat, cotton, soybeans and
rice receive more than 90 percent of our farm subsidies. Growers of the other
400 domestic crops grown receive nothing.

Because crop rather than need determines eligibility, billionaires such as Ted
Turner and corporate behemoths such as Georgia Pacific and Cargill are
subsidized. The struggling little guy, as often as not, receives nothing.

The U.S. cotton industry is a stark example of this distortion. Growers in the
Mississippi Delta are among the highest-cost cotton producers worldwide.
According to a recent report by the international aid agency Oxfam, the United
States spends nearly $4 billion yearly on subsidies for cotton producers, making
us the world's largest cotton subsidizer. Reflecting the farm industry overall,
the largest 10 percent of cotton farms receives 79 percent of all payments, and
the top 1 percent receives 25 percent. The average payment to cotton growers was
$331,000 in 2002; 25 growers received more than $1 million each.

FARM SUBSIDIES are a barrier to trade, putting the United States at a
disadvantage in negotiations for increased market access in other countries.
Countries are less than eager to remove trade barriers when the United States
won't remove its own.

Subsidies also undermine U.S. efforts to help developing economies. On the one
hand, the United States annually provides billions of dollars in foreign aid to
developing countries. At the same time, U.S. farm subsidies prevent farmers in
those countries from effectively competing in, or with, the U.S. market.

U.S. farmers claim that since their European counterparts receive subsidies,
they need them to compete. Yet New Zealand's prosperous agricultural sector -
which at one time was also addicted to subsidies - shows this is untrue. New
Zealand farm subsidies today are the lowest in the world. Meanwhile, the
country's agricultural sector is growing at a faster pace than the overall
economy.

In 1984, the New Zealand government did away with most farm subsidies. Without
subsidies, New Zealand's farmers don't make decisions based on government
handouts. They regrouped and reorganized. They cut spending. They found ways to
increase the market value of their crops or switched crops altogether.

Expectations to the contrary, New Zealand lost less than 1 percent of its
farming businesses. Family farming, not corporate farming, expanded. New Zealand
agriculture was not destroyed. Rather, it changed to meet the demands of the
market and thrived.

WHAT HAPPENED in New Zealand could be duplicated in the United States. In fact,
the United States has less at stake than New Zealand did. Agriculture in New
Zealand accounts for more than 13 percent of its gross domestic product. Here,
agriculture accounts for around 2 percent of GDP.

Simply put, there are too many reasons not to eliminate farm subsidies. Such a
reform - which the farm lobby would fight tooth and nail - would force U.S.
agriculture to make decisions based on market conditions, rather than the
availability of government subsidies. New Zealand has proved it's possible; it
is time for the United States to prove it again.

Deal Lets Infected Horses Enter Country for Olympics

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

SECTION: Section A;  Page 12;  Column 5;  National Desk

LENGTH: 1076 words

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 27


Yielding to international pressure, Georgia and Federal agriculture officials
have decided to permit some horses to compete in the Summer Olympics even though
they carry a tick-borne disease and would ordinarily be barred from the United
States. But other states' officials, horsemen and scientists are still debating
the risks to the American horse population.

The disease, piroplasmosis, is pervasive, but generally benign, in parts of
Europe and South America. Because it is extremely rare in the United States,
however, it is debilitating and potentially fatal to horses here, and the United
States Department of Agriculture bans the entry of horses that test positive for
it. Similarly, Georgia agriculture rules keep such horses out of the state.

But application of these rules this summer would have barred from the Games at
least 20 European champions and contenders for medals. And the animals had some
impressive lobbyists -- including the King of Spain, who owns a horse with
piroplasmosis -- who sought a waiver from the rules, arguing that a blanket ban
on the horses might violate free-trade agreements.

There has been no official ruling that a prohibition on the horses would violate
trade rules. And organizations like the American Horse Shows Association, the
American Horse Council and the Georgia Horse Council opposed waiving the rules.
Nonetheless, after months of negotiations, Georgia and Federal officials agreed
that if horses that tested positive would undergo a rigorous protocol intended
to minimize the risk of spreading the disease, they could enter the country and
compete in two of the three Olympic equestrian events.

Under the plan, these horses will be housed in an isolation barn and allowed to
compete only in show jumping and dressage, which will be held east of the city
at the Georgia International Horse Park, a confined, tick-free area. The horses
will get regular anti-tick sprayings and frequent testing.

Horses with piroplasmosis will not be permitted to compete in the three-day
combined training event, which puts horses over a course through the open
countryside of central Georgia. In July, experts say, that area is tick heaven.

"We heard from the world-trade community that a blanket ban by us might violate
the GATT and Nafta trade agreements because we would be throwing up an illegal
trade barrier without sufficient scientific information," said the Georgia
Agriculture Commissioner, Tommy Irvin, referring to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Irvin
described "the intensity of the pressure, with all of these international
figures saying, 'How can the Agriculture Commissioner of Georgia say we can't
come here when we go everywhere in the world without problems?' "

The rules have been waived before. For example, horses carrying the disease were
allowed to compete in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles because that area is dry and
inhospitable to ticks.

Some in the United States horse community support the final decision. John
Strassburger, editor of The Chronicle of the Horse magazine, called the
opposition to letting the horses compete a "tempest in a teapot" fueled by
irrational fears among horse owners in the United States. Robin Gifford,
executive director of the United States Dressage Federation, whose members will
be competing against European horses with piroplasmosis, said she was satisfied
with the Georgia plan.

But others are troubled by the decision and the international pressure. They
said they are only reluctantly going along with the plan. "We did our very best
to stop this from happening," said Eric Straus, director of the American Horse
Show Association, "but the decision has been made. We are going to have to live
with whatever happens because of this decision."

Amy Mann, director of health and regulatory affairs for the American Horse
Council, said, "Georgia has taken a tough stand, but it's not tough enough for
us."

Equine piroplasmosis, which poses no risks to humans, is transmitted from
infected horses by tropical horse ticks who take in their blood and then move
on, through hay, bedding or feed, to uninfected horses. Tropical horse ticks do
not attach themselves to animals other than horses and are found in tropical and
subtropical areas of the Caribbean and South America, as well as in temperate
zones of southern Europe.

In those areas, most horses with piroplasmosis show symptoms no more serious
than a cold. But where the disease is uncommon and there is little or no
resistance, infection can result in pneumonia, jaundice, infected lesions and
death.

Dr. Ralph Knowles, a field veterinarian in the Maryland Department of
Agriculture who has done research on the disease, said the tropical horse tick
existed in the extreme southern parts of the United States.

But, Dr. Knowles said, recent research shows that the more common dog tick and
winter tick may also carry piroplasmosis. These ticks, found in the northern
United States as well as the South, move easily among rodents, dogs and horses.

The plan requires that the disease-carrying horses be housed in a
vegetation-free, fenced and quarantined barn at the Horse Park. They will be
under 24-hour surveillance and checked for ticks every eight hours. Between now
and the end of the Games, the area will be sprayed with tick-killing chemicals
at least four times. All other animals will be kept out. Hay must come from
northern areas that are not infested with ticks, and bedding must repel ticks.

An uninfected "sentinel horse" will be tested regularly to see whether, despite
these efforts, the disease somehow has spread. Within seven days of competition,
the horses will have to leave the country.

Faced with Georgia's plan, states like Kentucky and New Jersey, which have
significant horse industries, are moving to insure that the disease cannot
spread there. Kentucky plans to test and quarantine all horses entering the
state from the Olympics. New Jersey plans to isolate all Olympic horses for 30
days of examinations and spraying.

"We are doing this more in response to industry concern," said Dr. Ernie Zirkle,
director of animal health for New Jersey, "than out of any great concern on our
part. We feel Georgia is doing the right thing, and with the safeguards they are
putting into place, I think it will be impossible for a horse to go there and
come back with the disease."

Broad Support Seen for Drought Aid

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 14, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 900 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11


As showers that began Saturday continued to fall on parts of the parched Midwest
and South, the chairmen of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees told
President Reagan today that there was widespread support in both parties for
legislation that would provide billions of dollars in relief to farmers whose
crops have been damaged.

In a meeting at the White House, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont,
chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Representative E. (Kika) de la
Garza, Democrat of Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said the
President expressed support for the legislation and indicated concern about
drought damage.

Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, Representative Edward R. Madigan,
Republican of Illinois, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana,
also attended the meeting.

'Encouraged' by Response

Senator Leahy said it was his intention to hold hearings on Capitol Hill this
week in order to shape the legislation into a form that could be approved. ''I'm
very encouraged by the response of the President,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''The
President asked us to be mindful of the budget. We are mindful of it.''

Republican Congressional leaders said they would be active in shaping the
legislation. ''There are no areas of disagreement,'' Mr. Lugar said.

The 25-minute meeting came as the Agriculture Department was preparing to
release a special study of the drought's effect on crop production. The study is
due out Tuesday. Mr. Lyng said, ''Perhaps never before in the history of the
United States has there been a July 11 on which so much uncertainty remained as
to the true supply and demand situation for U.S. agricultural production.''

'Wild Card' in Election

The activity at the White House and on Capitol Hill reflects a growing awareness
by both parties of the political consequences if they are seen as failing to
react to the distress caused by the drought. Republican political experts have
called the drought a ''wild card'' in the 1988 Presidential campaign, believing
that it may cause some voters to switch.

Democrats, meanwhile, hope to pick up support in the drought regions of the
northern Great Plains, the Middle West and the South, areas that have supported
Republican candidates in recent national elections.

The House and Senate versions, which are nearly identical, and which would cost
between $5 billion and $6 billion, call for disaster payments to be made to any
farmers who have lost at least 65 percent of their crops to the drought. The
payments are to be directed to farmers who raise vegetables, fruits, soybeans
and grains. Farmers would be eligible to receive payments amounting to
two-thirds of the market value of vegetable and fruit crops, and two-thirds of
the Congressionally set prices for grain crops.

Effect on Support Payments

In addition, some farmers who received support payments in advance from the
Government for grain crops would not have to refund portions of the payments if
the drought caused extensive damage. The Congressional staff members said they
believed that no more than $1 billion was involved in this part of the
legislation.

At the White House the drought has become a principal focus of activities this
week. On Tuesday, the President will meet with Congressional leaders of both
parties. On Wednesday, Mr. Reagan is tentatively scheduled to meet with Dean
Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, and presidents of
state farm bureaus. Both meetings will take place at the White House, officials
said.

On Thursday, Mr. Reagan leaves Washington to travel to Iowa and to tour parched
areas near Marion, Ill. He is scheduled to visit the farm of Herman Krone, who
raises corn and soybeans near Du Quoin. The trip, Mr. Reagan's first to assess
damage from the drought, recalled similar journeys by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who toured the Middle West and northern Great Plains in 1934 and
1936.

Reagan Wants Cooperation

Mr. Reagan, who has taken an active interest in the drought, has made it clear
to Mr. Lyng that he wants the Administration and Congress to work together to
aid farmers.

Meanwhile, the stubborn high-pressure weather system that produced the hot, dry
conditions over the northern Great Plains and Middle West collapsed over the
weekend, the National Weather Service said.

The weather system has been replaced by another that is helping to bring showers
over the Ohio Valley, the Dakotas, Iowa and parts of the South, particularly in
Arkansas. The showers are expected to persist through Tuesday and possibly into
Wednesday, meteorologists said.

Hot Weather Could Be Back

But the long-range forecast by the National Weather Service calls for the
high-pressure system to return, perhaps by the end of the week.

''The rain over the weekend and what we may get early this week helps,'' said
Ernest Paroczay, a meteorologist at the National Meteorological Center in Camp
Springs, Md., near Washington. ''But it's not going to end the drought.''

Across the Middle West, there were more indications that the corn crop has
already suffered extensive damage. Scientists at Purdue University in Lafayette,
Ind., estimated today that 40 percent of the state's harvest had been destroyed.
At about 650 million bushels of corn annually, Indiana is the nation's
fourth-largest producer.

U.S. grain crop to tumble 24%

BYLINE: Giles Gherson

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 393 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  U.S. grain production will fall 24% this year to 212 million metric tons, one
of the worst annual declines on record, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
reported yesterday in its latest forecast of the damage wrought by this summer's
drought.

But Agriculture officials said stockpiles of most grains will remain ample
throughout the year, allowing the U.S. to meet domestic demand and foreign
sales.

According to an American official, the U.S. will call on Canadian farmers for
additional supplies of higher grade Durham wheat.

The department warned that U.S. food prices will climb between 3% and 5% this
year because of rising prices that reflect decreasing supplies of farm
commodities. The estimate is one percentage point higher than food inflation
forecasts released by the department last month.

The higher food inflation forecast comes despite anticipated lower prices for
livestock, as supply mounts in the face of much higher-than-normal herd
liquidations due to feed shortages. U.S. red meat and poultry production is
expected to climb 3% from 1987.


The gloomy farm outlook could get worse if below-average rain levels continue in
the U.S. farm belt during the remainder of the growing season. The U.S. Weather
Service releases its updated 60-day forecast today.

Washington's eagerly awaited July World Crop Outlook sharply revised U.S. crop
expectations that were made only a month ago. The latest outlook calls for a 50%
fall in U.S. spring wheat production this year, a 26% decline in the corn crop,
a 45% smaller barley harvest, and a 13% cut in soybean production.

The 50% drop in anticipated spring wheat production, which accounts for 20% of
total U.S. wheat output, is a record decline. The previous record was a 30%
decline in spring wheat in 1949.

Overall, the U.S. wheat crop is expected to reach 1.84 billion bushels, 13%
below last year's harvest. U.S. winter wheat largely escaped drought damage,
turning in the fourth-highest yield per acre on record.

Ewen Wilson, U.S. assistant agriculture secretary, said the Agriculture
Department believes Canada's spring wheat crop has on balance received more rain
than the U.S. wheatlands. He said the Canadian wheat crop is expected to be 21
million metric tons this year, compared with 25.5 million metric tons last year,
a 17% decline.

Battle over Canadian cattle could hit home; Farmers Union official beefs about
reopening the border

BYLINE: JOHN EVERLY

SECTION: Agriculture; Pg. b8

LENGTH: 843 words


To open or not to open the border to Canadian cattle.

That question has been tossed around quite a bit lately by tri-state area
producers and the organizations that represent them. Our area is a major cattle
growing region, and local farmers understand that decisions made in Washington
could affect them one way or another.

For now, Canadian cattle older than 30 months of age are banned from the United
States. That ban has been in place since the December 2003 discovery of a single
case of mad cow disease in the United States in a cow of Canadian origin.

The Iowa Cattlemen's Association Board of Directors says re-establishing beef
trade with Canada should be conditional. The association opposes any cattle more
than 30 months of age, or product from any cattle more than 30 months of age,
entering the United States at this time. The group also insists that trade be
re-established with Japan and South Korea, and expanded in Mexico, before trade
in live cattle from Canada is resumed. The United States should have "absolute
assurance that the Canadian beef industry (ruminant protein) feed ban is in
place and working," the Iowa Cattlemen's Association said.

"We are adamantly opposed to reopening this border," said Iowa Farmers Union
President Chris Petersen. Petersen echoed the position of the National Farmers
Union, which has questioned Canada's safeguards against mad cow disease.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture published a final rule late in 2004
establishing minimal-risk regions for mad cow disease, with Canada as one of
those regions. That rule would have allowed in Canadian cattle younger than 30
months to be shipped across the border.

The rule was to become effective last Monday, but on March 2, the U.S. District
Court in Montana issued a temporary injunction to block the rule until a lawsuit
challenging the rule can be heard in federal court.

The next day, a resolution to disapprove the rule passed the Senate.

Meanwhile, the ag department's rule received a warmer reception during a House
Agriculture Committee hearing March 1.

The star witness was Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, who reported on his
department's recent fact-finding mission to Canada.

"Based on a review of inspection records and on-site observations, the team
found that Canada has a robust inspection program, that overall compliance with
the feed ban is good and that the feed ban is reducing the risk of transmission
of (mad cow disease) in the Canadian cattle population. Where isolated issues
were found to exist, they were related mostly to areas of documentation and
record-keeping," Johanns told the committee.

Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., thought the department was on the right
track.

"The United States has an array of protective measures including the feed ban,
Specific Risk Material removal and a robust (mad cow disease) surveillance
system. These are designed to shield our herd and consumers from current risks
and prevent the amplification of the disease if it was ever introduced into our
herd," he said.

Although some folks on this side of the border said the disease was Canada's
problem, it nonetheless brought our beef export trade to an abrupt halt. The
United States lost an estimated $3.3 billion in sales, accounting for between 9
and 10 percent of American beef production.

That means something to the tri-state area. Grant County, with 163,000 animals,
is Wisconsin's top cattle county and 48th among counties in the United States.
Dubuque County's 103,000 cattle make it the second biggest in Iowa and is ranked
76th in the nation. Jo Daviess County is Illinois' top cattle county, with a
herd of around 57,000.

*

Canadian feeder pig imports also are a contentious issue.

Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce reaffirmed its October 2004 decision
that Canadian producers are dumping live hogs in the United States.

The department said that provisional anti-dumping duties averaging about 11
percent will be placed on imports of live hogs from Canada. The ruling was
hailed by the National Pork Producers Council.

"Canadian hog producers unfairly benefit from huge subsidies that cause
overproduction in Canada and allow Canadian producers to sell their hogs in the
U.S. at artificially low prices," said council president Jon Caspers. "The flood
of low-priced hogs from Canada has pushed down U.S. hog prices and inflicted
severe financial harm on U.S. hog producers."

Not so, say the Canadians, because American and Canadian producers operate in
the same integrated North American market.

"Canadian swine producers are no more dumping than are U.S. hog producers," said
Clare Schlegel, president of the Canadian Pork Council. "Despite a trade law
written to find dumping in almost every case, Canadian pigs and hogs are not
injuring the U.S., but rather contribute to the very success of the North
American sector."

THE WORLD;
The World Debates How to Trade a Food Supply in Jeopardy

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: MONTREAL


IN the United States, grain stockpiles are down 135 million tons from their
record high in 1986, largely because of last summer's drought. In the rest of
the world, grain stocks have fallen an additional 50 million tons, creating what
some see as a precarious balance between the world's supply of food and the
demand for it.

Comparisons are being made to the food crisis year of 1973, and some are
invoking the name of Thomas Malthus, who warned 200 years ago that population
growth was destined to outpace the world's ability to feed itself.

Yet policy makers in the United States, Canada, Australia and other major
food-producing countries, particularly outside Europe, say a pessimistic view of
world food supplies is as unjustified today as it was in the days of Malthus.

They make these arguments:

* Farm productivity has been growing; in the United States it has risen 30
percent in the last decade.

* Future advances in technology offer the prospect of new plant varieties
resistant to insects, heat, drought, frost and disease.

* Wider use of technology now available could also increase food production.

Thus the experts, particularly in the United States, say the drought is masking
what they consider the main problem of the future for agricultural trade policy
- not a lack of food but an oversupply, stimulated by the $220 billion a year
that developed countries pay to subsidize farmers.

''In a world of subsidized agriculture, the long-term tendency to
over-production lurks only slightly below the surface,'' said Ewen M. Wilson,
the Agriculture Department's top economist.

Such views are sharply contested by other experts, who argue that changes may be
taking place in the world's environment that will make it more difficult for
underdeveloped countries to produce food or gain access to it at reasonable
prices.

Still, in global talks in Montreal last week, trade ministers from 96 countries
were arguing over American demands that the subsidies and other measures that
distort trade in agriculture be phased out early in the next century. The main
opposition came from the European Community, which rejects the notion that farm
protection should ever end.

When Europeans talk of farm subsidies, their arguments include the notion that
the world cannot be certain of an oversupply of food. They are also deeply
interested, for domestic political and social reasons, in preserving the
economic survival and way of life of their farmers.

In Montreal, the United States and the 12-nation European bloc were left in
deadlock. Trade ministers had some successes in other aspects of the
negotiations, whose aim was to advance a new round of trade liberalization
talks. But, in the end, the negotiators adopted a United States proposal to put
everything on hold for four months to give them a chance to break the farm
stalemate.

Washington is pressing Brussels on agriculture, American officials say, because
of ''near chaos'' in global agriculture - a condition they trace largely to
European policies. These policies, they say, stimulate overproduction, which in
turn results in the unloading of surpluses on the world. The Americans say this
undercuts the long-run ability of farmers in other countries to make a living.

Argentina and Uruguay export wheat and beef and are regarded as being among the
world's lowest-cost producers. Yet Barber B. Conable Jr., the World Bank
president, noted in Montreal that their share of the world market dropped from
11 percent to 3 percent over the last 15 years while the European Community
became one of the world's largest exporters. The United States also takes some
blame, for example, for tighter American import quotas that have cost Caribbean
islands $250 million in annual sugar exports.

But freer trade in agriculture has become such an important goal for the United
States that it has said it would drop its protection for sugar, dairy and other
American farmers if other countries cut supports as well.

On the other hand, the North American drought, by raising prices and thus
reducing the cost of export subsidies, has curbed some of the pressure on
Western Europe to restructure agriculture. Some experts argue that the effects
of the drought were made more severe by the so-called greenhouse effect,
described as a slow warming of the world that results particularly from the
burning of fossil fuels. In this view, the effort to get rid of subsidies is
misplaced because last summer's disaster will be repeated and the world needs to
protect agriculture in the interests of preserving food security.

''The talks in Montreal were focused on surpluses that may no longer exist, or
if they do exist are not real in the sense that they are being produced with the
unsustainable use of land and water,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the
Worldwatch Institute.

Those who want farm trade policies restructured counter that the efficient
exporters who are best able to respond to shortages are the ones who could be
forced under by heavily subsidized competition. William M. Miner, a Canadian
agricultural expert, put the argument this way: ''Bad weather is not an excuse
for bad policies.''

REPORT ON THE NETHERLANDS   Agricultural trade rules prompt painful debate

BYLINE: DAVID CLIMENHAGA; GAM

LENGTH: 858 words

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, The Netherlands


By  DAVID CLIMENHAGA
 The Globe and Mail
  THE HAGUE, The Netherlands
  The vexing question of European agricultural policy is a painful one for
the Dutch, long renowned as energetic free traders.

The United States, demanding an end to all subsidies on agricultural
products by the year 2000, is pressing the European Community hard to come
up with an agricultural position sooon to put before the latest round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Failure to reach agreement on agriculture, almost everyone agrees,
could destroy the GATT.

The EC, meanwhile, is hard pressed to reach agreement on agriculture
among its own members to put before the mid-term review of the so-called
GATT Uruguay round in Montreal in December.

For the Dutch - traditional free traders but loyal (and dependent)
members of the EC - the situation is distinctly uncomfortable. That the
Netherlands is the world's second-largest exporter of agricultural
products after the United States (and the world's largest in dairy and
poultry products), exporting more than 55 per cent of its total farm
output, compounds the discomfort.

More than 70 per cent of the country's agricultural exports go to the
EC, so bad news for the EC on agricultural policy is bad news for the
Netherlands. But the Dutch are still among the world's foremost traders,
so bad news for the GATT system is also bad news for the Netherlands.

"One should keep in mind that agriculture, for many reasons, is a bit
different from industrial sectors and services sectors," said Dutch
foreign trade minister Yvonne van Rooy. "It's not realistic to expect that
you can come to a new system where there's no protection, or no market
organization at all (for agriculture)."

"I believe that the Community is not able, in this year, to have
committed themselves completely to change their agriculture policy," said
Aart de Zeeuw, the Dutch Agriculture Ministry's director-general of
international affairs and chairman of the GATT agricultural negotiating
group. "That is impossible."

The U.S. position, Mrs. van Rooy argued, amounts to "get rid of all the
subsidies and trade barriers and then we will enter a sort of agricultural
paradise.

"Well, as you know, paradise does not exist on Earth, and not in
agriculture either. So I think the American position is not realistic."

In the months leading up to the mid-term talks in Montreal, Mrs. van
Rooy said, both the EC and the United States must be prepared to give a
little ground on the current positions.

"I think if we are prepared to discuss the long-term approach
(advocated by the United States) in the sense that we really have to
reduce our subsidies . . . the Americans and other trading partners, Japan
especially, should also be prepared to discuss the short-term approach."

Moreover, she said, "a country like Japan cannot say 'We are not a net
exporter, so it's none of our business.' They are a super net exporter in
industrial products, and therefore should allow in the field of
agriculture more imports into their country. They should not just sit
behind and leave the scene to Europe and the United States to do the
fighting."

The basis for a compromise, Mrs. van Rooy suggested, may be an approach
to subsidies developed by Mr. de Zeeuw under which the strong farm
subsidies in use today would be replaced by a system of fixed levies that
would still give farmers some protection from fluctuations in
international commodity prices.

Under his proposal, Mr. de Zeeuw said in an interview, agricultural
trading nations would agree to end practices such as direct payments to
farmers, variable levies on imports, quotas and export subsidies. They
would be replaced by import levies set at agreed-upon fixed levels.

The levies, which by agreement would not be subject to change, would
give farmers some protection from imports, but not nearly as much as in
the market-distorting norm today.

"What I say is you can have a different price on your own market than
on the international market and you can realize it by a fixed tariff . . .
so that your price is always 10 or 20 (European currency units) higher
than the international market . . . but it still goes up and down."

Despite the firm U.S. position and the danger to the GATT of no
compromise being found, Mr. de Zeeuw added, "I'm not too pessimistic about
the atmosphere between the United States and the Community.

"They know very well that they need to compromise at a certain moment.
I believe that within a few months they will try to be constructive. . . .

"The United States, in my view, is willing - if there is a commitment
that shows the direction (the EC will take) - to come to a compromise."

The political problem now facing the EC, Mr. de Zeeuw said, is to go at
least that far - to make a commitment by the end of the year on the
direction Western European agricultural policy will go.

The fundamental problem that confronts all parties to the world's
agricultural conundrum was summed up by Jan Bergman, director of the Dutch
Agriculture Ministry's economic affairs and market regulation departments:
"The Americans, the Canadians, the Europeans, they want free trade for
those products in which they have a good competitive position. Yes?"

U.S. barley subsidy aims at EC

BYLINE: Associated Press

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 137 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


The U.S. Department of Agriculture yesterday announced a package of export
subsidies to help U.S. growers compete with the European Community for barley
malt sales in several overseas markets.

Ann Veneman, deputy secretary of agriculture, said the U.S. would subsidize
sales of up to 175,000 tonnes of U.S. barley malt through June 30, 1993.

The EC's barley malt subsidies, which total about two-thirds of the value of the
barley malt itself, ''hurt U.S. producers and cannot be left unchallenged,'' she
said.

''With today's announcement, we are continuing our efforts to pressure the EC to
reduce subsidies, curb expansion of its production of all commodities and make
meaningful policy reforms in the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,'' Veneman said.

National 4-H Conference Delegates Present to House Agriculture Committee

LENGTH: 409  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Jackson: Growing Mississippi has issued the following news release:



  Yesterday, the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture,
and Research gathered to hear a presentation by the National 4-H Conference
participants concerning the future of agriculture in the United States.





 The National 4-H Organization is the nation's largest youth development
organization that serves to help its six million student members better
understand the agriculture industry. Last year, members of the Agriculture
Committee heard from 17 distinguished 4-H delegates to the National 4-H
Conference whose presentation highlighted the importance of bridging the gap
between rural and urban areas. Today, that discussion continued with 16
delegates from this year's conference recognizing the challenges associated with
food and fiber production, how to enhance global food security, and how those
challenges affect the future of agriculture.



 "For the second year in a row, it has been a pleasure to hear from such
distinguished young leaders in the agriculture industry on what they believe to
be the biggest challenges and opportunities facing agriculture in the United
States. The National 4-H Organization is a great platform for young students of
both agriculture and non-agriculture related backgrounds to develop leadership
skills and learn about this great industry. As we work toward developing the
next farm bill, it is essential we hear from a wide variety of stakeholders on
where we can make meaningful improvements to agriculture policy. Today's
discussion provided a great opportunity to hear from some of these young
stakeholders on what they hope to see for the future of agriculture," said
Subcommittee Chairman Rodney Davis (R-IL).



 "It's great to see so many young people involved and committed to agriculture.
We're often reminded that the average age of a farmer is in the 50s, but we
don't always hear about the great number of youth involved. It's critical that
we continue to make transitioning a farm from one family member to another as
easy as possible, as well as support policies that help pave the way for the
next generation of farmers. Organizations like 4-H, which I participated in many
years ago, are an important part of achieving those goals," said Subcommittee
Ranking Member Suzan DelBene (D-WA).

U.S. ponders   more boards

BYLINE: GAM

LENGTH: 203 words


Critics of Canada's marketing boards often point to the United States to
 back up their claims. They attribute lower food prices there to the free
 enterprise structure of the U.S. food industry.

However, the United States has innumerable marketing boards of its own
 and is considering more, according to Dale May of the Agricultural
 Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Called marketing orders, the U.S. boards differ in several ways. But,
 as in Canada, some of them control prices and supplies, and others are
 involved in research, market promotion or quality control.

They are used by producers of milk, citrus fruits, potatoes, walnuts,
 hops, cotton and wool. Suppliers of eggs and flowers are considering new
 marketing boards for their products.

The milk boards are the most similar to their Canadian equivalent. A
 market administrator is appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to
 oversee a region or a state. He sets the minimum farm gate price for milk
 and tries to even out production over the year.

In addition to the boards, U.S. food producers are also assisted by a
 range of federal subsidies which, according to some estimates, will cost
 the taxpayers up to $30-billion (U.S.) this year.

Farm Export Gains Seen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26


The Agriculture Department has predicted that the value of United States
agricultural exports will rise to a four-year high in the fiscal year 1988.

The new forecast, of $32.5 billion, is $500 million higher than the previous
estimate given Dec. 17. The increase stemmed from recent sales of grain to the
Soviet Union and China, partly under a special export subsidy program.

Steve MacDonald of the department's Economic Research Service said the Soviet
Union might account for $1.7 billion of the total exports in the fiscal year,
which began Oct. 1. That would be the most since 1985, when Moscow's purchases
totaled $2.5 billion. Soviet purchases last year were about $700 million.

China's purchases of American farm exports are expected to be about $500
million, more than double the $200 million of 1987, Mr. MacDonald said.

If the Agriculture Department projections are correct, the 1988 farm exports
will be the highest since 1984, when they were valued at $38 billion.

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 Agriculture specialists with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of
Field Operations (OFO) at the Veterans International Bridge import cargo lot
intercepted a "First in Port" pest in a shipment of fresh corn.





 "The interception of this miniscule, yet destructive pest, for the first time
at the Port of Brownsville, is an outstanding example of the diligence and
dedication of our CBP agriculture specialists in safeguarding the agriculture of
the United States," said Port Director Petra Horne, Brownsville Port of
Entry.The interception occurred on July 27, at the Veterans International Bridge
import lot when a shipment of fresh corn was referred to agriculture for
inspection.  Upon inspection of the corn, CBP agriculture specialists
intercepted a pest.  The pest was submitted for identification to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) entomologist who identified it as Oncometopia
clarior (Walker) (Cicadellidae) an actionable pest. On July 28, 2016,
identifiers with U.S. Department of Agriculture Plant Inspection Station,
confirmed the interception of Oncometopia clarior (Walker) (Cicadellidae), as a
first time interception at the Port of Brownsville.



 Oncometopia clarior (Walker) is a pest not known to occur in the United States.
This insect belongs to the Cicadellidae family, commonly known as leafhoppers.
Many leafhoppers are serious pests of cultivated plants, and a few act as
vectors of plant diseases.



 Given the quarantine status of Oncometopia clarior (Walker), the shipment of
corn was re-exported to Mexico as a precautionary measure.

US CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AGRICULTURE SPECIALISTS IN FLORIDA INTERCEPT
FIRST-IN-PORT PEST AT PORT EVERGLADES

LENGTH: 327 words


FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 17 -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued the following press release:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO)
agriculture specialists working at Port Everglades discovered a strange pest on
ginger arriving in a shipment from Lima, Peru on July 1.

Upon completing a visual and physical examination of the cargo, the container
was sealed pending quarantine action. Agriculture specialists submitted the pest
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Systematic Entomology Laboratory
and identified as Oliarus sp. (Cixiidae), an actionable pest confirmed to be a
"first-in-port" pest at Port Everglades.

Cixiid species are comparatively small and inconspicuous. Nymphs live
underground, feeding on roots. Adults feed on herbs, shrubs and/or trees. Some
are polyphagous, while others are specialized on their host plants (monophagous)
and feed on the juices of a variety of plants.

"Our CBP agriculture specialists are very skillful in identifying actionable
pests and determining all potential threats to agriculture in the United States
," said Port Everglades Port Director Jorge Roig. "We are proud of their hard
work every day on the job."

Each day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helps to prevent the
intentional and unintentional introduction of potentially harmful plant pests
and foreign animal diseases from entering the United States at more than 300
ports of entry.

Millions of pounds of fresh fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, herbs, and other
items enter the United States via commercial shipments from other countries
every year. In Fiscal Year 2014, there were 66,857 reportable pest
interceptions. View CBP's Agriculture Fact Sheet.

STATES IN CASH BOOST

SECTION: 1st Edition; NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 266 words


AGRICULTURE Secretary, Ann M Veneman, has announced that the United States
Department of Agriculture will contribute $ 8.8 million (pounds 4.9 million) to
two international research collaboratives seeking to control and eliminate
Johne's Disease in cattle, sheep and goats and porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, or PRRS, in swine.

"These grants will support critical research, education and extension activities
to develop practical applications against these diseases," said Ms Veneman.

"We are pleased to partner with the University of Minnesota's College of
Veterinary Medicine on this project."

These diseases cause more than $ 800 million (pounds 446.5 million) a year in
losses to the industry and the consuming public.

"Project collaborators include more than 100 scientists and education experts
from two dozen institutions in 20 states as well as experts in Canada, Mexico,
Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia," said Joseph J Jen, USDA
undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics.

PRRS first appeared in the United States in 1986 and is found worldwide and in
all major swine-producing areas of the United States. PRRS results in
reproductive failure in adult females and pneumonia in nursing pigs and can lead
to death. It spreads easily among herds.

Johne's Disease is a chronic, infectious, wasting disease of cattle. Symptoms
include chronic diarrhea and weight loss, decreased milk production, reduced
fertility, and eventually death.

An estimated 22 per cent of all US dairy herds are infected with Johne's
Disease.

COMMODITIES;
Grains, Soybeans Rise On Foreign-Sale Rumor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section D; Page 12, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 402 words


Grain and soybean futures prices rose a little yesterday amid rumors of foreign
demand, some of which were confirmed following the close.

During the session, there were numerous rumors that China and the Soviet Union
were in the market for sizable amounts of soybeans and that the Soviet Union,
China and India were buying wheat and corn.

After the close, the United States Agriculture Department said private exporters
reported the sale of 100,000 tons of wheat to unknown destinations and 400,000
tons of wheat and 325,000 tons of corn to the Soviet Union.

Analysts said European markets were active as the United States dollar declined
against foreign currencies, a development that improves the exchange rate and so
tends to encourage foreign buying.

Higher Bids Reported

Meanwhile, a major exporting concern reportedly increased its bids on soybeans
in the cash market at Gulf of Mexico export locations.

Some traders were reportedly evening up their contract positions ahead of the
Agriculture Department's crop production report released after the close.

It projected that the United States corn crop now being harvested would be a
record 8.1 billion bushels, up 22 percent from last year's crop and slightly
more than projected a month ago. Soybean production was put at 2.08 billion
bushels, up 16 percent from the 1980 harvest of 1.82 billion bushels and 1
percent lower than what was forecast a month ago. Analysts later said the
figures were on the low side of market expectations and could prompt a little
buying today.

On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat settled yesterday as much as 5 1/4 cents
higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $4.35 3/4 a bushel, and
corn 3 cents higher, with December at $2.81 1/2 a bushel.

On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee prices rose sharply
as traders focused again on the possibility that supplies certified for delivery
against the futures contract will not be sufficient to cover outstanding
contracts. December-delivery coffee rose 4.41 cents, to 148.86 a pound.

Cattle prices were mostly higher and pork fell on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Analysts cited weaker prices for hogs at livestock terminals in the
morning and expectations for weaker prices today.

Canada's agriculture trade rules criticized

BYLINE: HEATHER SCOFFIELD Parliamentary Bureau

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 317 words

DATELINE: Ottawa


Criticism about the federal government's position on agriculture at the World
Trade Organization is growing, both within and outside of Canada.

New Zealand's special agricultural trade envoy and Saskatchewan's Agriculture
Minister yesterday accused Ottawa of being hypocritical, by promoting the end of
subsidies for grains but requesting protection for Canada's dairy and poultry
industries.

"Canada still wants to have special treatment in terms of supply management,"
complained New Zealand envoy Malcolm Bailey.

New Zealand is counting on Canada's support to fight massive grain subsidies
dished out by the European Union and the United States, he said. And since
Canadian grain farmers would benefit from such a reduction in subsidies, Canada
should also be prepared to give up some of its protectionist measures such as
supply management of dairy, poultry and eggs.

Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief has said that Canada will fight hard
for the reduction of domestic and export subsidies for agriculture during the
round of multilateral trade talks due to be launched next week in Seattle.

Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Dwain Lingenfelter said yesterday that Ottawa
was not taking a strong enough stand against the high grain subsidies paid by
the European Union and the United States. And while Ottawa has slashed its
subsidies to grain farmers in the West, it is actively campaigning to protect
dairy and poultry producers in Ontario and Quebec.

"They're not speaking up loudly enough against [European] subsidies, and at the
same time they've disqualified one part of Canada for subsidies," he said.

The Canadian Wheat Board pleaded with the federal government to increase aid to
Prairie farmers.

"Many Western Canadian farmers, despite being as or more efficient than their
U.S. and EU counterparts, are going broke," Greg Arason, chief executive officer
of the wheat board, said yesterday.

Agric to Become Mainstay of Local Economy - Adesina

LENGTH: 514 words

DATELINE: Abuja


MINISTER of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, weekend,
said Nigeria was set to reclaim her pride of place in agriculture as the main
stay of the economy.

The minister made this statement at the just concluded agric business summit
organised by the Embassy of Nigeria and Corporate Council on Africa, CCA, with
support from the World Bank.

Dr. Adesina in his address, "articulated investment opportunities in Nigeria's
agricultural sector. He noted that agriculture accounts for 75% of the growth of
the non-oil sector of the Nigerian economy, and assured that the present
administration is "creating enabling environment, developing infrastructure,
safeguarding investments, reducing official bottlenecks and motivating local and
international investors."

The minister confidently proclaimed the feasibility of reclaiming the former
glory of Nigeria as a net exporter of food from its current net importer
position.

One of the panel discussion focused on the huge potential for tomato paste
processing and fresh produce grading and packaging export centres.

The Minister's presentation, which drew applause, triggered more than a dozen
prospective investors to meet with him after his presentation.

A former US Ambassador to Nigeria, Amb. Howard Jeter said "we are deeply
impressed with the calibre, knowlege and vision of the Minister of Agriculture
of Nigeria. This is Nigeria at its best".

If Nigeria keeps on this way it will become Africa's leader in agriculture". The
Vice President of the US-Exim Bank, Wanda Felton, praised the Nigerian Minister
of Agriculture for "smart leadership" in steering a revolution of agriculture as
a business, with several concrete results, in such a short time in office. "This
has a huge potential to transform Nigeria's economy and diversify it away from
oil and gas", she said.

Nigeria's Vice President, Namadi Sambo led the high-powered delegation, which
also included the governors of Rivers, Kaduna, Kwara, Nasarawa and Ekiti States.
The event witnessed a sell-out capacity of 600 registered attendees from across
the United States of America and Nigeria.

Among other high profile participants at the forum were Sanusi Lamido, Governor
of the Central Bank, Evelyn Oputu of the Bank of Industries, CEO of Union Bank,
Funke Osibodu, CEO of Nigerian Stock Exchange, Oscar Onyema, Former United
States Ambassador to Nigeria, Robin Sanders, Chairman, Nigerian Economic Summit
Group, Foluso Phillips, who moderated the panel discussion on Nigeria's
Agribusiness Investment Climate and Financing Framework.

Managing Director of Nigeria Export-Import Bank, Robert Orya, and his United
States counterpart, Rick Angiuoni, Regional Director of Export-Import Bank of
the United States, CEO of Dominion Farms Limited, Calvin Burgess, who recently
signed a $40 million investment partnership with Taraba state government in
collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development,
while Timothy Prewitt of USAID MARKETS highlighted on the role of market in
ensuring the success of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda.

FUTURES MARKETS;
Prospects of Weak Demand Push Corn to 4-Month Low

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section D;  Page 16;  Column 1;  Financial Desk

LENGTH: 419 words


Corn futures prices dropped to a four-month low yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid prospects for a bigger South African crop and weaker demand for
United States corn.

Corn for March delivery fell 5 cents, to $2.7575 a bushel, the lowest settlement
for near-term deliveries since Nov. 11.

The March corn contract has lost 11.5 percent of its value since Jan. 13, when
it traded at a five-and-a-half- year high of $3.1175 a bushel. The market's
decline has been partly a result of slack demand for American corn.


South Africa

The prospects for weak demand weighed even more heavily on the market yesterday
after the attache in South Africa for the United States Agriculture Department
put that country's 1993-94 crop, which is nearly ready for harvest, at 14
million metric tons, 2 million more than the previous estimate.

The news means world demand for American corn could decline by up to 2 million
metric tons, or 78.8 million bushels, according to Gerald Zusel, a vice
president of E.D.& F. Man International Futures in Chicago.

"If South Africa has an additional two million tons, you could almost add that
back to the U.S. carry-out," he said. "That's going to reduce tightness in the
United States."

Last month, the Agriculture Department estimated the United States corn
carry-out, or ending stocks, at 777 million bushels on Aug. 31, the end of the
1993-94 marketing year.


Wheat Drops

Wheat futures sank as precipitation fell in the winter wheat fields of the
southern plains. A storm pounded south-central Kansas and the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles with snow and thunderstorms.

March wheat fell 4.25 cents, to $3.38 a bushel, the lowest settlement since Nov.
9; March oats slipped 1 cent, to $1.2550 a bushel, and March soybeans fell 2.25
cents, to $6.6325 a bushel.

The Agriculture Department's rejection of an Egyptian bid for 200,000 metric
tons of United States wheat at subsidized prices also weighed on wheat futures,
analysts said.

Crude oil futures ended unchanged on the New York Mercantile Exchange, an
indication that traders continued to expect that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would make no change in oil production at a March 25
meeting.

Light sweet crude for April delivery finished unchanged at $14.10 a barrel;
April heating oil slipped 0.02 cent, to 43.35 cents a gallon; April unleaded
gasoline rose 0.14 cent, to 43.89 cents a gallon, and April natural gas climbed
2.9 cents, to $2.196 for 1,000 cubic feet.

Mandelson calls for farm tariff concession

BYLINE: Dan Bilefsky

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 604 words

DATELINE: PARIS


Peter Mandelson, the European Union's chief trade negotiator, warned on Monday
that Europe's offer to cut its agriculture tariffs could evaporate if trading
partners like Brazil, India and the United States did not come forward with
further concessions.

''I cannot sell a deal in which Europe gives but gets nothing in return,''
Mandelson said in a speech in Berlin after meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel
and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. ''That is not a negotiation that
is a capitulation.''

Mandelson's defiant words came just two days before trade ministers are to meet
at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in an effort to break a
deadlock in negotiations. At a meeting in Hong Kong last month, World Trade
Organization members gave themselves an April 30 deadline to hammer out a
compromise for opening trade in agriculture, services and industrial goods.

Trade analysts said Mandelson's hardening stance showed that little progress had
been made since Hong Kong and warned that a trade deal appeared increasingly
unlikely.

Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London,
said Merkel could potentially push a recalcitrant France to make more
concessions on agriculture reform, while acting as an interlocutor with the
United States. But he added that she had shown few signs so far of making trade
liberalization a priority.

''The only person who could make a difference is Merkel, who has unrivaled
popularity at home and is widely recognized as someone who is not caught up on
old arguments,'' he said. ''But she has a lot on her plate.''

People close to Mandelson said he and Merkel had agreed that progress depended
on developing countries like Brazil slashing industrial tariffs in key areas and
the United States easing demands for European cuts in agriculture.

''Merkel agreed that Mandelson was already at the outer limits of his
negotiation mandate and could not budge further,'' said a person present at the
talks who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.

In his speech, Mandelson said Washington's excessive focus on agriculture was
threatening the talks. He said the United States, which will overhaul its own
farm programs next year, was using global trade negotiations for domestic ends.
And he warned that the EU would not accept ''post-dated checks'' written by
Washington, referring to a U.S. offer to cut subsidies on an unquantified basis
at some unspecified point in the future. ''The EU and the United States broadly
want the same things, but the different negotiating tactics are preventing us
from getting them,'' he said in an interview. ''Unless we close those
differences, we stand to lose what's on offer in agriculture.''

Christin Baker, spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative, Robert Portman,
said congressional support for the United States' aggressive proposals to slash
subsidies and make deep tariff cuts depended on the EU providing greater market
access in agriculture.

''Agriculture remains the sticking point and everyone agrees that Europe hasn't
gone far enough,'' she said.

The EU has offered a 38 percent average cut in farm tariffs and an end to its
export subsidies by 2013. Washington argues this does not go far enough and has
proposed that wealthy nations cut their lowest tariffs by 55 percent and their
highest by 90 percent.

Mandelson said the EU's ability to cajole developing countries into opening
their markets for high-end exports from Europe was dependent on Europe dropping
''unreasonable'' import duties on inexpensive mass-produced goods from countries
like India and Brazil .

U.S. grain plan   may hurt price

BYLINE: CP

LENGTH: 264 words

DATELINE: Ottawa ONT


Canadian Press
    OTTAWA  - Canada can depend on its good relations with the United
 States to help protect grain prices against the $2-million U.S. grain
 bonus plan announced last week, Agriculture Minister John Wise says.

"We can take some satisfaction in the fact that the U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture (John Block) indicated to me that he would do everything  possible
so that we would not get caught in the crossfire," he told the  House of
Commons.

Mr. Wise said he "expressed some concern" when Mr. Block informed him
 late last week of the program and the two plan further discussion "in the
 very near future regarding the issue, but I think we can take some
 satisfaction because of the improved relations between the two countries
 that has taken place and developed since Sept. 4."
    But Liberal agriculture critic Maurice Foster said the new program,
 which would make $2-million worth of grain available starting June 1 for
 bonuses to countries which purchase grain from the United States, "could
 have a very distorting and devastating impact on the price of grains in
 the world, perhaps even touching off a price war.
    "It sounds to me like the Minister was more of a pussycat than someone
 really defending the interests of agriculture in this country," Mr. Foster
 told Mr. Wise in the Commons.

A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the bonuses would
 effectively reduce the price of U.S. wheat and reduce world prices. Canada
 would likely have to lower its prices as well but full details of the
 program and its effects are not yet known, the spokesman said.

U.S. REPORTS A RISE IN FARMS

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 12, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 238 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28


The number of farms in the United States increased this year for the first time
since the Depression, the Agriculture Department said today.

Some of the increase was attributed to higher agricultural produce prices. The
department defines a farm as a place that sells $1,000 of produce. Because of
price levels, some places that may have offered $800 in produce for sale, for
example, may get $1,000 for the same goods, and qualify as a farm.

But officials also said there is an increase in the number of small farmers,
particularly in the West.

8,000 Farms Added in a Year

It was estimated that there are 2,436,000 farms, or 8,000 more than in 1980, an
increase of three-tenths of 1 percent. The trend is expected to continue next
year, adding 1,000 farms to the total, the department said.

The increase is the first in 46 years. The Government reported an increase to
6,810,000 in 1935 from 6,780,000 farms in 1934. The decline has been steady
since.

There was a rise in farming this years in the West and, to a lesser degree, in
the East. The yearly decline in number of farms leveled off in the Middle West
and, in general, elsewhere.

Decline in Farms Has Slowed

While the decline in the number of farms in the Middle West has been steady,
that trend has been tapering off there and elsewhere.  Nationally, from 1975 to
1980, the numbers have been stable.

Washington: Philadelphia CBP Intercepts a Nationâ[#x20ac][TM]s First

LENGTH: 391  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently confirmed the tiger moth
that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists
intercepted in a shipment of Colombian apple bananas at the Philadelphia seaport
is the nation's first recorded find of this species.





 CBP agriculture specialists discovered the insect specimen on August 8 during a
routine produce container inspection and submitted the pest to the local USDA
entomologist for identification. The following day, the entomologist determined
the specimen to be Cosmosoma ruatana (Erebidae) with an additional comment that
this specimen is a new pest.  On September 9, the USDA national pest
identification database confirmed the specimen as the first reported discovery
of Cosmosoma ruatana (Erebidae) in the United States.Insects belonging to the
family Erebidae, or tiger moths, are considered polyphagous, which makes them
potential pests of concern to many different agriculture crops.



 "Intercepting destructive insect invaders at our nation's borders, before they
can threaten our agriculture industries, is of great importance to Customs and
Border Protection," said Margaret Braunstein, Acting CBP Area Port Director for
the Port of Philadelphia. "CBP agriculture specialists take their job very
seriously, and this 'First-in-Nation' insect interception is a significant
discovery."



 CBP agriculture specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences, risk analysis, and imported agriculture inspection
techniques.  CBP agriculture specialists are the first line of defense in the
protection of U.S. agriculture, forest, and livestock industries from exotic
destructive plant pests and animal diseases.



 On a typical day nationally, CBP agriculture specialists inspect over one
million people as well as cargo arriving by air and sea to the United States.
They also intercept approximately 4,548 prohibited meat, plant materials, or
animal products, and discover over 470 agriculture pests and diseases that could
have detrimental effects to our nation's agriculture resources, food production,
and animal and human health.

Judge Bars Milk Support Paid by the Farmers

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., June 3


A Federal district judge ordered the United States Department of Agriculture
today to stop making dairy farmers help finance milk price supports and to
return to them more than $21 million that had been collected.

The Agriculture Department last month began taking 50 cents for every 100 pounds
of milk sold by dairy farmers after the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit overturned a temporary restraining order against the assessments,
which was issued by District Judge Matthew Perry.

That order was handed down in April after the State of South Carolina and
several dairy farmer groups sued to halt the fees.  The appeals court dissolved
the order last month so that collection could begin while Judge Perry heard
arguments on the merits of the case. And today, after hearing those arguments,
Judge Perry issued his injuction blocking the collection of the funds.

U.S. Catfish Program Could Stymie Pacific Trade Pact, 10 Nations Say

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 826 words


WASHINGTON -- Ten Asian and Pacific nations have told the Office of the United
States Trade Representative that the Agriculture Department's catfish inspection
program violates international law, and their objections could hamper Obama
administration efforts to reach a major Pacific trade agreement by the end of
next year.

They say that the inspection program is a trade barrier erected under the guise
of a food safety measure and that it violates the United States' obligations
under World Trade Organization agreements. Among the countries protesting are
Vietnam and Malaysia, which are taking part in talks for the trade agreement --
known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- and have the ability to derail or hold
up those negotiations.

The complaints are outlined in a May 28 letter signed by diplomats from the 10
countries. The letter does not threaten retaliation, but it emphasizes that the
American catfish program stood in the way of the trade talks.

Vietnam, a major catfish producer, has long complained about the program, but it
has never before won international support for its fight. Several of the
countries whose representatives signed the letter -- including the Philippines,
Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia -- do not have catfish industries to protect and
are not involved in the trans-Pacific trade talks.

But the letter expresses the concern that the inspection program could lead the
Agriculture Department to expand its ability to regulate seafood exports to the
United States, catfish or not.

''Many of these countries are looking to see what happens to Vietnam on the
catfish issues, and what precedents it might set for other trade deals in the
region,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington and the co-author of a book on the
Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States and 11 countries on both sides of
the Pacific -- as well as Australia, New Zealand and Brunei -- are still
negotiating the trade pact, which has been repeatedly delayed over various
disputes.

The Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers recently hired James
Bacchus, a former chairman of the World Trade Organization's appeals panel, to
prepare a possible legal challenge to the catfish inspection program.

Mr. Bacchus said in an interview that only governments have standing to bring a
case before the trade organization, but that the export group was working
closely with Vietnamese officials to monitor the catfish inspection program.

''I'm confident that Vietnam would have a case before the W.T.O. if they decided
to bring one,'' said Mr. Bacchus, a former United States House member from
Florida who is now a lawyer with Greenberg Traurig in Washington.

The inspection program was inserted into the 2008 farm bill at the urging of
catfish farmers, who have been hurt by competition from both Vietnam and China
and by the rising cost of catfish feed. The domestic catfish industry has shrunk
by about 60 percent since its peak about a decade ago, and in the past few years
about 20 percent of American catfish farming operations have closed.

The catfish industry and lawmakers led by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of
Mississippi, fought for the new office, saying it was needed to protect
Americans from eating fish raised in unsanitary conditions or contaminated with
drugs. The Food and Drug Administration has a similar program, but it inspects
less than 2 percent of food imports, and advocates of the Agriculture Department
program said that was not good enough.

The Agriculture Department has traditionally inspected meat and poultry, while
the F.D.A. has been responsible for all other foods, including seafood.

Agriculture Department inspections are more stringent than those conducted by
the F.D.A. The Agriculture Department also requires nations that export beef,
pork and poultry to the United States to set up inspections that are equivalent
to the agency's program -- an expensive and burdensome regulation that Vietnam
says is unnecessary for catfish. A Government Accountability Office report in
May 2012 called imported catfish a low-risk food and said an Agriculture
Department inspection program would ''not enhance the safety of catfish.''

The Agriculture Department said it had spent $20 million since 2009 to set up
its office, which has a staff of four, although it has yet to inspect a single
catfish. The department said it expected to spend about $14 million a year to
run the program; the F.D.A., by comparison, spends about $700,000 annually on
its existing seafood inspection office.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and other critics say the
Agriculture Department program is a waste of money, and Mr. McCain sponsored an
amendment in the latest farm bill that would have killed the program. But the
measure was never brought up for a vote. The Obama administration has also
called for eliminating the Agriculture Department program.

Russia's unpaid debts mount up

BYLINE: Reuter

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 219 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


Russia's defaults on U.S. agricultural loans jumped Thursday to US$95.7 million
as banks filed 20 default notices totalling US$27.4 million, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.

Russia has been suspended from the department's food credit program since late
November for failing to make scheduled payments on loans that enabled it to buy
millions of tons of U.S. grains and other food.

Russia still owes more than US$4 billion for the three-year loans it has
received since January 1991. The loans are offered by private banks, but backed
by the U.S. government.

So far no banks have filed claims for the government to reimburse them.

Banks filed the default notices before the holiday weekend and in some cases did
not wait the usual 10-day period to file claims after payments came due, an
Agriculture Department spokeswoman said. No more notices were expected before
Monday.

She said notices have been filed by six banks so far.

Banking sources say they doubt Russia will resume repaying the loans until it
settles on a debt-restructuring plan with its major creditor nations.

Meanwhile, Russia's suspension from the credit program has weighed on grain
prices as U.S. farmers have come to depend on the vast former Soviet Union
market to absorb much of their surplus production.

Geneva Talks Move Toward Farm Pact

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 29


Working into the early hours of Thursday, five crucial players, including the
United States and the European Union, reached an informal agreement on
agriculture that has put global trade talks back on track, although behind
schedule.

Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the World Trade Organization,
released a statement Thursday afternoon saying he welcomed the incipient
agreement on agriculture, which he said gives momentum to the talks.

With less than two days remaining, delegates and officials said that the United
States in particular had made significant compromises on Wednesday night,
inspiring optimism that the talks would lead to an agreement and advance the
Doha round of trade for the developing nations.

''I think it looks good,'' said Arancha Gonzalez, spokeswoman for Pascal Lamy,
the top trade official for the European Union.

While officials were reluctant to disclose specifics on the discussions or even
describe them as an agreement, they did say that the United States seemed
willing to put off some of its more contentious demands on agricultural
subsidies and, instead, offer to make cuts in other areas.

The United States had been the focus of attacks on Wednesday by some poor
countries for failing to make specific compromises in agriculture. Agriculture
has been so crucial to this round of talks that the World Bank has said that an
agreement could add $3 trillion in benefits to the global market place.

Attempts to reach an agreement last year in Cancun, Mexico, ended in failure.
Rich countries were accused of catering to their largest commercial farmers who
receive $300 billion in subsidies and supports every year to the detriment of
farmers in poor countries who cannot compete against the subsidized commodities.

However, in talks Wednesday through the early Thursday, the European Union's
offer of eliminating its export subsidies was matched by an American proposal
that was described as a cut in trade-distorting domestic subsidies in the first
year of a new trade accord, according to officials close to the discussions who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.

If that holds, the likelihood of an agreement improves, particularly because it
could satisfy the poor West African nations that have been demanding that the
United States end its cotton subsidy.

Richard Mills, the spokesman for Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade
representative, refused to comment on details of the talks, but said they were
very useful.

''We're being realistic,'' he said after the talks that lasted until nearly 2
a.m. Thursday. ''We're not pessimistic, and we're not optimistic.''

Australia, Brazil and India were the other three countries meeting with the
United States and the European Union in a group known as the Five Interested
Parties. Together they are the crucial factions that must agree if the entire
147-member party is to reach an accord this week.

Now top officials at the World Trade Organization must assemble the compromises
suggested by this group, and a handful of other blocs representing the richest
and the poorest farmers of the world, and publish a text of an accord. Officials
were expecting that text by midnight on Thursday.

With an agreement on agriculture close, new questions were raised about efforts
to lower trade barriers to industrial goods, especially in the poorer,
developing countries. Wealthy countries argued that since they were overhauling
their agricultural programs, the developing world should further open their
markets to industrial goods.

But African delegates said that further negotiations were necessary to make this
an equal trade-off.

While most delegates met behind closed doors, several African officials held a
news briefing on Wednesday singling out the United States as a barrier to a
trade accord because of its cotton subsidies.

''Thousands and thousands of small farmers are being destroyed, their families
going hungry because of the unfair subsidies of American cotton,'' said Ousmane
Ngom, Senegal's minister of trade, who represents one of the four African
nations that have pressed for emergency relief from what they call unfair
trading practices on cotton.

For its part, the United States has offered some development assistance from its
existing aid programs. But it has been reluctant to single out cotton for deeper
subsidy cuts than other basic commodity programs, which include corn, wheat,
soybeans and rice, to avoid an unsettling precedent.

The African ministers agreed to put cotton back into overall agriculture talks,
but called the news conference to warn they had reached their bottom line and
were waiting for a response from Mr. Zoellick and the American delegation.

Then later Wednesday night, at least 27 countries registered their complaints
that the group negotiating behind closed doors was being accorded too great a
role in the talks. China, Malaysia, Chile and Japan were among the countries
voicing concerns.

China and Chile are powerful members of the Group of 20 developing nations that
was formed in Cancun last year to push the wealthy nations to cut their
agricultural supports.

Japan, which puts a 490 percent tariff on rice, is an outspoken member of the
Group of 10 wealthy countries that includes Norway and Switzerland. They have
joined with the European Union in asking for continued protections on what they
call sensitive products, a proposition that has been criticized by developing
nations.

Mr. Lamy was under pressure, as well, with European ministers gathering in
Geneva to meet and assess whatever new draft text is produced. Led by President
Jacques Chirac of France, several European countries including Hungary, Italy
and Poland -- allies of the United States in Iraq -- were concerned that Europe
had made greater concessions than the United States on agriculture and that
their farmers would suffer as a result.

But Mr. Zoellick has promised that the United States would be a leader in this
round of talks and has traveled around the world to wring out a compromise,
however vague, on agriculture.

''Although we won't unilaterally disarm,'' Mr. Mills, the American spokesman,
said, ''we are committed to global reform in the W.T.O. and the United States
has stated its willingness to cut subsidies and tariffs if others will.''

Phil Bloomer, the director of Oxfam International's Make Trade Fair Campaign
that has focused on European and American farm subsidies, said that the United
States had to make a serious concession immediately.

''The European Union has said it will eliminate export subsidies and give an end
date,'' Mr. Bloomer said. ''The West African nations made the concession of
putting cotton inside agricultural talks. Now its up to the United States to
make a similar concession.''

Ottawa demands halt in U.S., EC trade war

BYLINE: OLIVER BERTIN; The Globe and Mail

SECTION: ROB; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 583 words


In a hard-hitting statement released in Cairns, Australia, federal
 Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer warned the United States and the EC
 that their farm policies have severely distorted the world market in
 wheat, and that Canada is suffering.

He told them to "restrain both the production and the release of
 (wheat) to the world market." If they cannot figure out how, then Canada
 will tell them how at the next meeting of the International Wheat Council
 in Washington early next year.

The statement was supported by Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins
 and Lucio Reca, Agriculture Secretary of Argentina.

Australia, Argentina and Canada export wheat in competition with the
 United States and the EC.

Mr. Mayer was in Cairns for a meeting of 14 agricultural nations. The
 countries said they are the victims of a trade war between the United
 States and the EC that is costing them billions of dollars every year in
 lost sales and depressed prices.

They have formed an international trading alliance called Fair Traders
 in Agriculture to bring pressure on the United States and the EC to end
 their agricultural trade war. The members include: Canada, Australia, New
 Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia,
 Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay.

The EC is believed to spend about $100-billion (U.S.) annually on farm
 support programs and the United States about $35-billion. By comparison,
 Canada spends about $4.5-billion (Canadian) and Australia far less.

These large subsidies have severely distorted the world markets in
 grain, livestock and sugar, and caused global economic losses of $36-
 billion (U.S.) in 1980 dollars, according to a World Bank report released
 at the meeting.

Farmers in developing countries bear the brunt of the losses, about
 $28-billion a year, and this has intensified the rural poverty and human
 misery in the Third World, the bank said.

"But it has done more than this," Australian Prime Minister Robert
 Hawke said. "It has seriously undermined the capacity of these
 (developing) countries to service their external debt.

"As many as one in five western Canadian wheat farmers may be forced
 out of business and, in Australia's case, the (EC subsidy) policy has been
 costing about $1-billion (Australian) a year in recent years."

Mr. Mayer did not place a figure on Canada's losses, but the premiers
 of the three Prairie provinces have asked Ottawa for a $1-billion cash
 payment to compensate them for the effects of the trade war.

The United States will not volunteer to cut food production - despite
 Canada's threats - but it will try to scale down farm subsidies within two
 years, said Daniel Amstutz, U.S. undersecretary of agriculture.

He told reporters in Washington yesterday that he will try to speed up
 farm negotiations when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade comes up
 for discussion in Uruguay next month.

"This fast track on agriculture is of fundamental importance to our
 position," he said. "We really want this agriculture thing put to bed in
 two years because (otherwise) the problems are enormous."

He said the United States was willing to compromise, but only if the EC
 and other exporters do so as well. "We have said time and time again that
 we're willing to put everything on the table and we think others should
 too."

However, he added that "I have no illusions about the difficulty" of
 the negotiations.

The EC, at the instigation of France, has so far refused to place
 agriculture on the agenda at the GATT talks.

MARYLAND:Maryland Celebrates National Agriculture Week; 10 Ways You Can Get
Involved With Maryland Agriculture

LENGTH: 412  words

DATELINE: Annapolis


Department of Agriculture, The state of Maryland has issued the following news
release:

Did you know that most of life's necessities - food, fiber, clothing and shelter
- start with agriculture? National Agriculture Week (March 15-21) recognizes and
celebrates the contributions of agriculture to American society. In recognition
of Maryland agriculture as one of the state's most important industries,
Governor Larry Hogan has declared "Maryland Agriculture Week," which coincides
with the national celebration. From the mountains of Western Maryland with its
dairy farms and hay to Central Maryland with its greenhouse and livestock
industries to the Eastern Shore's acres of corn and poultry - Maryland truly
grows something for everyone.

"Maryland's agriculture industry is vital to the long-term health of the state's
economy, environment and quality of life," said Governor Hogan. "Maryland
farmers are doing everything they can to balance protecting our Bay with
building strong, durable businesses. And we're going to do everything we can to
keep Maryland's agricultural industry strong, diverse and sustainable."

There are 2.1 million farms in the United States, a country with nearly 319
million people. Agriculture products remain the nations' top export. Each
American farmer today feeds more than 144 people - a dramatic increase from 25
people in the 1960s. American agriculture is doing more - and doing it better.
As the world population soars, there is an even greater demand for the food and
fiber produced in the United States.

"Agriculture Week is a great time to recognize the hard work of our farm
families and the important role they play in providing a safe and abundant food
supply and protecting the environment," said Agriculture Secretary Joe
Bartenfelder.

In Maryland, one-third of the land mass - over 2 million acres - is farmland. In
2013, the top commodity sectors were poultry (broilers), greenhouse and nursery,
corn, and dairy. In addition, Maryland farmers produced 33 million pounds of
apples, 673 million eggs, 3.9 million tons of peaches, and 68 million pounds of
watermelons just to name a few of the many products that are grown here. For
more interesting facts about Maryland agriculture, see the AgBrief.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture shares 10 suggestions to help citizens
recognize National and Maryland Agriculture Week:

Washington: Baltimore CBP Intercepts First in Nation Destructive Beet Flea
Beetle in Shipment of Italian Ceramic Tiles

LENGTH: 322 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 A U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) entomologist confirmed Wednesday that
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Field Operations (OFO)
agriculture specialists at the Port of Baltimore made a first in nation pest
discovery when they intercepted a live insect known as Chaetocnema breviuscula
Felderman (Chrysomelidae), a beet flea beetle, while inspecting ceramic tile
from Italy.This jumping beetle chews little holes in the leaves of agriculture
crops.  Young plants suffer badly and normally die.





 &ldquo;Keeping this pest out of the nation saves the American agricultural
industry from the expense of eradication, and the hardship of finding their
crops damaged by a new danger,&rdquo; said Dianna Bowman CBP Area Port Director
for the Port of Baltimore.  &ldquo;By stopping destructive species at the
border, before they can enter the United States for the first time, CBP officers
and agriculture specialists protect this vital American industry.&rdquo;



 The beetle was discovered November 12 at the Baltimore Seaport in the interior
of a container containing ceramic tile from Italy.  The specimen was forwarded
to a USDA- Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) - Plant Protection
Quarantine (PPQ) entomologist for identification.



 On November 25, USDA confirmed that this was the first identification of this
species in the United States.



 CBP Agriculture specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences and agriculture inspection. On a typical day nationally,
they inspect over 1 million people as well as air and sea cargo imported to the
United States and intercept 4,447 prohibited meat, plant materials or animal
products, including 425 agriculture pests and diseases.

EA Whispers - The Region Can Now Truly Fight Food Poisoning [column]

BYLINE: Isaac Mwangi

LENGTH: 688 words


Kenya's recent decision to approve the use of Aflasafe - a product that combats
aflatoxin poisoning - by farmers is a major step with an impact that will be
felt in the agricultural, public health and trade sectors.

Aflatoxin contamination in food grain and feed in Kenya has become a major
concern. Aflatoxin causes liver cancer, suppresses immunity and stunts the
growth of children. Nearly 200 people, including school children, have died in
Kenya due to acute aflatoxin poisoning in the recent past.

The magnitude of the problem is easy to see. Whole swathes of the country and
the region are affected. The food chain is contaminated. Both human beings and
livestock suffer from the effects of aflatoxin poisoning. The effects on humans
are long-term and affect the development aspirations of communities, while the
effect on animals impacts negatively on trade in meat and livestock products.
Needless to say, trade in cereals and livestock feed is also affected by
aflatoxin contamination.

Yet, many poor rural households have really no option when it comes to dealing
with the problem. Sometimes, the choice is between eating contaminated food and
not eating at all. This, of course, also contributes to the ballooning health
bill that governments and communities have to meet.

Again, aflatoxin contamination may occur at various stages, either when the crop
is in the field or during post-harvest handling and storage. This makes it
imperative to obtain all-encompassing solutions that take care of every stage in
the handling of food.

This is why earlier in the year, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Fisheries dedicated Ksh1.5 billion ($15 million) for aflatoxin mitigation in the
country.

This is what makes the decision by the Pest Control Products Board to register
Aflasafe so significant. AflasafeKe01 was developed by the Kenya Agricultural
and Livestock Research Organization. Other key participants in its development
have included the United States Agency for International Development,
USDA-Foreign Agriculture Service, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the
African Agriculture Technology Foundation (AATF), and the CGIAR Research
Programme on Agriculture for Nutrition & Health.

This biological control principle, initially developed by the United States
Department of Agriculture - Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS) is widely
used in the United States. It was adapted by the International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture, in partnership with USDA-ARS and others, for use in
several African nations.

Nigeria is the only country in Africa with a manufacturing plant that produces
Aflasafe. Kenya began construction of its own plant to produce Aflasafe toward
the end of last year, ensuring that East Africa will soon be in a position to
effectively combat aflatoxin poisoning.

Aflasafe is said to be highly effective, with up to 98 per cent aflatoxin
reduction in farmers' fields. Moreover, it persists from one season to the next
and disperses beyond the fields that are treated. These characteristics allow
for area-wide approaches to aflatoxin management, with the potential for both
cumulative benefits that increase with each year and community-wide benefit
where entire areas can achieve relief.

It would be good to see similar approvals being granted by other national
authorities across the region. This will ensure that once the plant in Katumani,
Machakos, becomes operational, farmers across the region will easily access
Aflasafe without delay. It will be sad for any delays to be occasioned by
bureaucratic delays and approvals.

When all is said and done, no country can be truly independent without food
security. Aflatoxin poisoning is one of the major reasons for lack of food
security in tropical areas, including East Africa.

With all the other reasons for rising food insecurity being so difficult to
tackle and ranging from civil wars to corruption, sheer incompetence to economic
sabotage, and failed IMF prescriptions to poor agricultural practices, it is
welcome news that East Africa is well on the way to tackling one of the more
serious problems leading to food insecurity.

Killing subsidies key to GATT agriculture deal

BYLINE: Jill Vardy

SECTION: SECTION 2, SPECIAL REPORT: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 842 words

DATELINE: Ottawa,Ont.


  Nobody knows better than Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski that without a
deal on agriculture, the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will be a
failure.

That's why Canada is calling for a substantial reduction in the level of
domestic farm subsidies and elimination of export subsidies by all nations
governed by the General Agreement on Tariffs & Trade (GATT).

Canada's position will be tabled by Monday. According to estimates, Canada
proposes a cut of 50% in domestic farm-subsidy programs and the scrapping of
export subsidies.

Mazankowski, who is also Canada's minister of Agriculture, hopes Canada's
position will be enough to save this round of trade talks.

''If there isn't a deal on agriculture, I'm fully convinced there's no deal on
the multilateral trade negotiations,'' Mazankowski says. But he added that the
political will of the major trading countries to make a deal on agriculture
seems to be intensifying.

The Uruguay Round is faced with resolving the contentious issues related to the
use of export subsidies (which distort competition in international trade),
quantitative restrictions (such as import quotas), and other nontariff barriers
(such as health and sanitary regulations) that restrict market access.

The Economic Council of Canada estimates that domestic farm-support programs
around the world now cost consumers and taxpayers about $290 billion a year. In
Canada, direct transfers to farmers amounted to about 40% of the value of
agricultural output in 1989, according to a recent GATT report.

The main stumbling block to an agreement on agriculture has been the high
political cost of eliminating farm-support programs, the council says. For
example, the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy is considered
sacrosanct by many European countries, and the EC has been the most unwilling of
all world trading partners to tamper with the formula.

How far the Europeans and the U.S. - the world's two biggest agricultural
exporters - will cut subsidies is the linchpin for the GATT negotiations. Some
analysts say cuts to internal farm support measures may be negotiated at around
50%, with a phase-out of export subsidies over a number of years.

Mazankowski says it must be the Europeans and the U.S. who go the furthest on
agricultural compromise.

''We've heard a lot of rhetoric both from the Americans and Europeans,'' he
says. ''They're the ones that have caused all the problems, so naturally, we
want to be very, very careful ensuring that they do their bit in a fairly
substantive way.

''A flat percentage )of cuts in subsidies( across the board will still create a
distortion. So there has to be a quantum adjustment so we can establish a fair
and equitable base.''

The EC has proposed a 30% cut in its farm support over 10 years (1986-96) and
has said it would negotiate cuts in its export subsidies, which totalled almost
$13 billion in 1989.

The U.S., meanwhile, is set to table a proposal that calls for a 90% cut in
export subsidies, a reduction of 75% in internal support measures and a 75% cut
in tariff barriers for all agricultural products.

One of the touchiest issues for Canada will be protecting its supply-management
system from being lumped in with international definitions of internal support
measures.

Supply management is used to match the production of agricultural products to
demand in the market. Imports are restricted to keep the balance intact.

Canada's GATT proposal would allow the country's supply-management system for
dairy products, poultry and eggs to continue, but import restrictions would be
relaxed and production rules enhanced.

Mazankowski added that the position Canada has carved out on supply management -
while not supported by most of its trading partners - has been endorsed by all
provinces and was protected by the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement.

Getting a deal on export subsidies has become more of a priority for Canada
since the EC and the U.S. have beefed up their subsidization in recent months.
On grain exports, for example, the EC has tripled its subsidization in the past
year to almost $160 a metric ton, Mazankowski says. The U.S. export enhancement
has increased from US$20 a metric ton to US$60 a metric ton in the past three
months.

''I think what's happening is they're both flexing their muscles to demonstrate
that they really mean business, and that we better get on with some substantive
progress at the GATT negotiation,'' Mazankowski says. For Canada's grain
farmers, the need for progress increases with every hike in foreign subsidies.

International prices for grain are so low now that Canadian farmers are in
desperate need of government help to get them through the glut. Mazankowski is
designing a long-term safety-net program for Western farmers that would be
GATT-consistent, and not subject to trade dispute with other countries.


But it's a difficult process - especially while GATT rules about income support
remain unclear.

The Young Farmers

SECTION: Section 6; Page 110, Column 5; Magazine Desk

LENGTH: 114 words


One might infer from reading David Kline's article ''The Embattled Independent
Farmer'' (Nov. 29) that young people are not going into farming. According to a
United States Department of Agriculture study made by Dr. Calvin Beale, there
were 401,000 farmers under the age of 35 in 1980. This may be compared with
265,000 under the age of 35 back in 1970. The group of younger farmers has
increased, whereas the total number of farmers has declined. Actually, the
median age of farmers has declined from a peak of 53.1 years in 1970, to 48.6
years, in 1980.

Olson reaffirms US support to small farmers

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 72

LENGTH: 556  words


US Ambassador to Pakistan Richard Olson, while reaffirming the United States
government's long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan, on Wednesday
said that US is keen to promote agriculture in Pakistan.

He said this while addressing a gathering of government officials including
Taimur Azmat Osman, Secretary Ministry of National Food Security and Research,
Dr Iftikar Ahmed, Chairman Pakistan Agriculture Research Centre (PARC),
researchers, and farmers during his visit to the National Agriculture Research
Center (NARC), which was established with the help of the US government in the
1980s.

Ambassador Olson said, "The United States is committed to helping the small
farmers of Pakistan through projects that enhance agricultural productivity." He
also said that since the 1950s, the United States has been working to support
agriculture in Pakistan, introducing the Kinnow orange and helping to double
Pakistan's wheat production. Today, we continue our support because improving
crop yields, protecting food sources from disease, and boosting milk production
will increase farmers' incomes, improve nutrition, and ultimately strengthen
Pakistan's prosperity."

The Ambassador lauded the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement
Project (WPEP), a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program managed
in collaboration with national and provincial research partners that has
successfully introduced the UG 99-resistant wheat variety, "NARC 2011."

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming
community. "Wheat accounts for approximately 60 percent of the daily caloric
intake of the average Pakistani, so our joint efforts to combat this disease are
critical," said Ambassador Olson. "The Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project
team and Pakistani scientists at national and provincial research stations have
made great progress in the fight against wheat rusts, and I encourage you to
continue your work together."

In addition to support for the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project, the
United States has provided new harvesting machines and funded improvements to
research stations around Pakistan to develop more disease-resistant wheat
varieties.  The United States also provides specialized training opportunities
to Pakistani wheat scientists.

Dr Muhammad Imtiaz, Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center, noted that without disease-resistant varieties of
wheat, such as the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimate that Pakistan's
annual wheat harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99
arrives. "Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs
45 percent of the labor force, making it one of the most significant economic
drivers of Pakistan," Dr. Imtiaz said, adding, that Pakistani farmers grew about
24 million tons of wheat on eight million hectares last year, accounting for
about 2.4 percent of the GDP.

"Today, our long-term commitment to Pakistan's agriculture sector is sustained
through projects that help fight animal and crop diseases, increase vegetable
and mango production, improve irrigation, increase dairy production, and support
wheat research, " Ambassador Olson concluded.

Possible discovery of mad cow disease in U.S.: Prime minister had hoped to press
Bush to reopen U.S. border to live Canadian cattle

DATELINE: OTTAWA


The possible discovery of a new case of mad cow disease in the United States
shows the United States and Canada share a common - but minimal - problem with
the potentially fatal malady, beef industry and political representatives said
yesterday.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would run further tissue tests
on an animal that had raised the possibility of mad cow disease in preliminary
testing.

If the cow tests positive for BSE, the U.S. Agriculture Department will go
through a lengthy process of tracing the source of the disease, as it did when a
Canadian-born cow in Washington state tested positive last December.

Initial tests have been inconclusive, said U.S. officials, who cited privacy
concerns in refusing to reveal the location of the cow or where it was born.

Federal Agriculture Minister Andy Mitchell it would take up to a week for the
United States to have conclusive results.

The co-chair of the House of Commons agriculture committee said a positive test
result could actually prove to groups that have lobbied for the U.S. border to
remain shut to Canadian cattle that the two countries face the same challenge.

"The basic thing I'm hearing from home is that if it is positive it certainly
puts the States and us on a more level playing field when we talk about borders
opening and closing," said Saskatchewan Conservative MP Gerry Ritz.

"Now the States (would be) in the same boat we are."

Stan Eby, president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said any new case
shouldn't derail negotiations on reopen the U.S. border to live Canadian cattle.

Prime Minister Paul Martin was planning to push U.S. President George W. Bush on
the issue during his visit to Ottawa on Nov. 30.

Mad cow disease attacks an animal's nervous system. People who eat food
contaminated with BSE can contract a rare illness that is nearly always fatal,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

VETERAN FARMER PICKED AS STATE AGRICULTURE HEAD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 587 words


SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - John F. ''Jack'' Rundquist, a farmer for more than
40years who has studied farming systems as far away as Europe and China, was
appointed on Monday as director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Rundquist's appointment to the $65,835-a-year post is subject to confirmation by
the Illinois Senate and is effective Dec. 1. He replaces Larry Werries, who
resigned Oct. 1 to become director of intergovernmental affairs at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  ''Jack has been a major influence in the
agricultural community over the years, including recent contributions as a board
member and chairman of the Illinois Farm Development Authority,'' Gov. James. R.
Thompson said in a statement announcing the appointment.  ''I am confident
Illinois farmers and agriculture, in general, will benefit greatly from both
Jack's knowledge of the needs of the farming community and his vast experience
in both domestic and international farm economies.'' Rundquist said one of his
first mo ves as director would be to travel the state to meet leaders of farm
organizations.  ''I think it's great to be in the governor's Cabinet, and I want
to do a real good job representing all the farmers and agribusinesses of
Illinois, '' he said.  Rundquist, 66, of Butler, recently retired as president
of Evergreen Farms Inc. and Illini Grain and Livestock Inc. He is still part
owner of the businesses, which are being run by his son, John.  Rep. Bruce
Richmond, D-Murphysboro, chairman of the Illinois House Agriculture Committee,
also had praise for Rundquist. ''He comes highly recommended, and I think he
will be a fine director,'' he said.  Rundquist said he had ''a real positive
feeling'' about the future of farming in the state.  ''There are a lot of
problems in Illinois agriculture, but we have a great state,'' he said. ''We
have a lot of resources. We've had an excellent crop yield in most parts of the
state this year. The farm economy is looking better.'' Rundquist has visited and
studied farming in Europe, China and Mexico.  During the past nine years, he
helped develop and start a project to import Chinese hogs for research at the
University of Illinois, Iowa State University and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.  He received his bachelor's degree in agronomy from the University
of Illinois in 1946 and his master's degree in 1947.

US embassy leads trade delegation to promote innovation in agriculture

SECTION: Vol. 09 No. 29

LENGTH: 307  words


U.S. Embassy Economic Counselor Joel Robert Garverick will lead a delegation of
senior Pakistani government officials, businessmen, farmers and agriculture
experts to Atlanta,

Georgia, to promote US-Pakistan bilateral commercial ties and increase trade and
investment in agriculture.

According to a press release, the delegation will remain in US till February 4
and will attend the 2017 International Production and Processing Expo (IPPE),
the United States' largest annual trade show for the poultry, meat, and feed
industries, building on the theme, 'Innovation in agriculture.'

Following the expo, the group will meet with US agribusiness executives and
researchers, including experts at the Georgia Tech Agriculture Technology
Research Group and Innovation Lab, to explore innovations that could benefit
Pakistan, expand bilateral trade, and create investment opportunities for US
companies. The group will also visit a peach farm in Georgia, and conduct
meetings with Georgia' Farm Bureau, Cotton Commission, State Department of
Agriculture, and the US Department of Agriculture's Research Service.

Representatives from all four provinces of Pakistan will take part in the trade
mission, as well as officials from the Ministry of Food Security and Research,
the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif
University of Agriculture Multan. Agriculture is Pakistan's leading industry,
accounting for more than twenty percent of GDP and two-fifths of employment.
Major products include cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables,
dairy, beef, mutton, poultry and eggs. The United States is Pakistan's largest
trading partner, exporting $447 million in agricultural goods to Pakistan in

2015. These imports help support Pakistani agricultural exports, which were $
3.7 billion in fiscal year 15/16 (July-June).

'Mad cow' case found in U.S.;
Japan and South Korea halt imports; USDA assures beef on market is safe

BYLINE: JEFF NESMITH

SOURCE: Cox Washington Bureau

SECTION: News; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 995 words


Washington --- The first known case of "mad cow disease" in the United States
has been identified in a paralyzed cow slaughtered at a Washington state packing
plant, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said Tuesday.

Japan, the largest overseas market for U.S. beef, immediately banned imports
from the United States.

Exports totaled about $843 million in 2002, according to the U.S. Meat Export
Federation.

"Until its safety can be confirmed, we decided to ban U.S. beef imports for the
time being starting today," said Yasuo Fukuda, the Japanese government's top
spokesman. "We plan to recall meat products that might contain bits from cattle
brains and spinal cords."

In Seoul, South Korea, the government halted customs inspection of U.S. beef,
effectively preventing the meat from reaching market. South Korea's Agriculture
and Forestry Ministry said it also suspended sales of all U.S. beef already on
the market. Singapore and Malaysia followed suit and authorities in other Asian
nations were also deciding whether to invoke bans.

Veneman said the diseased animal, known as a "downer cow" because it could not
walk when brought to Vern's Moses Lake Meats slaughterhouse, was processed Dec.
9.

Parts of the cow that could be infected --- the brain, the spinal cord and the
lower part of the small intestine --- were removed before meat from the rest of
the cow was sent to a deboning plant called Midway Meats and then to two
processing facilities, Willamette and Interstate Meat, Agriculture Department
officials said.

A test first revealed the problem 12 days after slaughter.

But Veneman said Americans should not be concerned about the safety of beef. She
said she intended to serve beef for Christmas dinner.

Humans can contract a form of mad cow disease if they eat infected beef or nerve
tissue and possibly through blood transfusions. The human form of mad cow
disease, known as Cruetzfeldt-Jakob Disease, has killed 143 people in Britain
and 10 elsewhere. None have been in the United States. Blood donors possibly at
risk for the disease, which creates sponge-like holes in brain tissue, are
banned from giving.

Veneman said at a news conference that the Agriculture Department was working
with the Food and Drug Administration to trace and recall the meat.

She emphasized that there was no evidence of a terrorism link to the incident,
which came to light while the country is under a heightened "orange alert" for a
possible attack.

The announcement sent shock waves through the U.S. beef and meat industries,
which geared up immediately for an advertising and public relations campaign
aimed at assuring Americans that beef is safe to eat.

Agriculture Department meat inspectors took samples of brain and spinal cord
tissues for analysis after seeing the paralyzed cow --- a Holstein --- being
brought in for slaughter, Veneman said.

The tissues were tested and retested at a Agriculture Department laboratory in
Ames, Iowa, and found to be infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the
scientific name for mad cow disease.

The farm near Yakima, Wash., from which the cow was sold has been quarantined,
Veneman said.

Veneman said scientists have yet to find a case of mad cow disease being
transmitted to humans from a cow's muscle tissues, which make up most of the
beef sold to consumers.

Veneman's press conference was held at about 5 p.m. EST, several hours after the
department had notified cattle and meat industry organizations.

Mad cow disease is one of a group of neurological disorders that have baffled
researchers for years.

Scientists say certain proteins, known as prions and found in brain tissue,
become damaged and cause tissue to develop sponge-like holes.

Diseased prions can cause other prions to become diseased, but scientists have
been unable to figure out how that happens.

However, the illness develops slowly, and symptoms may not appear until years
after a person is exposed to the infection.

The discovery of hundreds of diseased cows in England in 1986 led to the
decimation of the cattle industries there and in other European countries. The
Canadian beef industry is reeling from the discovery in May of an infected cow
in Alberta. Consumer groups have pressed the Agriculture Department and the FDA
for tighter restrictions and inspections.

After the European outbreaks, reforms were enacted in Europe and the United
States in the way cattle are fed and slaughtered. Specifically, cows cannot be
given feed that contains bone meal or other tissue rendered from other cows or
sheep.

However, manufacturers of cattle feed are allowed to put products of cooked-down
chicken and pig parts into cattle feed to enhance its protein content. Consumer
groups have lobbied for a ban on the use of any rendered meat in animal feed.

Veneman said all "downer cows" are tested for mad cow disease at
slaughterhouses. But a former Agriculture Department veterinarian, Lester
Friedlander of Wyalusing, Pa., said inspectors often ignore such animals because
of pressure from the government and meat processors.

In addition, he said in a telephone interview, industry pressure has caused the
department to relax inspections of ambulatory cattle for signs of neurological
disorders. Last week, a federal appeals court revived a lawsuit filed by the
animal rights group Farm Sanctuary that challenged the government's policy on
processing "downer" animals.

"We shouldn't be using downer cows in our food supply at all," said Karen Taylor
Mitchell of the advocacy group Safe Tables Our Priority. "There is a USDA
regulation about not using them for the school lunch program. Yet it is OK for
the same children who are protected at school to go home and be served sick
cows."

Veneman said consumers can get daily updates by reading the department's Web
site, http://www.usda.gov, or by calling 1-866-4USDACO.

Pakistan: Ambassador Olson highlights U.S. support to small farmers

LENGTH: 676 words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, May 10 -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Olson today reaffirmed the United
States government's long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan. "Since
the 1950s, the United States has been working to support agriculture in
Pakistan, introducing the Kinnow orange and helping to double Pakistan's wheat
production.

Today, we continue our support because improving crop yields, protecting food
sources from disease, and boosting milk production will increase farmers'
incomes, improve nutrition, and ultimately strengthen Pakistan's prosperity."

Addressing a gathering of government officials, researchers, and farmers during
his visit to the National Agriculture Research Center (NARC), which was
established with the help of the U.S. government in the 1980s, Ambassador Olson
said, "The United States is committed to helping the small farmers of Pakistan
through projects that enhance agricultural productivity."

The Ambassador lauded the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement
Project (WPEP), a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program managed
in collaboration with national and provincial research partners that has
successfully introduced the UG 99-resistant wheat variety, "NARC 2011."

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming

In addition to support for the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project, the
United States has provided new harvesting machines and funded improvements to
research stations around Pakistan to develop more disease-resistant wheat

Dr. Muhammad Imtiaz, Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and

wheat, such as the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimate that Pakistan's
annual wheat harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99
arrives. "Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs
45 percent of the labor force, making it one of the most significant economic
drivers of Pakistan," Dr. Imtiaz said. Pakistani farmers grew about 24 million
tons of wheat on eight million hectares last year, accounting for about 2.4
percent of the GDP.

"The United States and Pakistan have similar agricultural systems, and for that
reason we have been effective partners in agriculture for more than half a
century, working together to improve agricultural yields and to combat disease,"
said Ambassador Olson. "Since the 1950s, U.S. and Pakistani scientists have
collaborated to increase wheat production.

At that time, Dr. Manzoor Bajwa and Dr. Norman Borlaug worked together to
develop 'Mexi-Pak,' the wheat variety that started the Green Revolution in
Pakistan and helped to double Pakistan's wheat production between 1965 and
1970."

"Today, our long-term commitment to Pakistan's agriculture sector is sustained
through projects that help fight animal and crop diseases, increase vegetable
and mango production, improve irrigation, increase dairy production, and support
wheat research, " Ambassador Olson concluded.

U.S. wheat growers back subsidies   Urge USDA to 'stay the course'

BYLINE: GAM

LENGTH: 312 words

DATELINE: Washington DC


Bloomberg Business News
  WASHINGTON
 U.S. wheat growers are urging Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to
continue wheat export subsidies, even as wheat supplies plunge in the
United States and around the world.

"Stronger prices do not mean the end of competition," said Ross Hansen,
president of the U.S. National Wheat Growers. Mr. Hansen added that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture must "stay the course" on its controversial
Export Enhancement Program.

Mr. Hansen met with Mr. Glickman Thursday, as Canadian Wheat Board
commissioner Richard Klassen issued a statement from Winnipeg, saying the
United States should end its use of the $800-million (U.S.) export subsidy
program.

"We are facing one of the tightest world wheat situations on record and
for the U.S. government to continue to use export subsidies - which are
difficult to justify even when supplies are abundant - simply defies
logic," Mr. Klassen said.

In a statement yesterday, Mr. Hansen dismissed Canada's arguments and
similar appeals by Australia. They are appeals by "state-run wheat
marketing monopolies" that also slash prices to compete in world markets,
he said.

The Export Enhancement Program pays exporters to offer a discount on
U.S. wheat. It's currently funded at $800-million but will tentatively
jump to about $959-million for fiscal 1996, which begins Oct. 1.

Wheat normally grabs about 80 per cent of all EEP subsidies. Even so,
the U.S. share of world wheat exports is 32 per cent, unchanged from five
years ago.
 Wheat futures in Chicago soared yesterday, as the European Union said it
will suspend its export subsidy program until September because of tight
stockpiles.

The USDA projected Wednesday that U.S. wheat supplies in storage by
May, 1996, will total 428 million bushels, the lowest level in 22 years.

World wheat stocks are projected to fall to 107 million tons, the
lowest in 20 years, the USDA said.

Cotton Acres May Decline

BYLINE: By United Press International

SECTION: Section D; Page 17, Column 3; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 231 words


The Agriculture Department said yesterday that cotton acreage in the United
States for the 1982-83 season may fall slightly from this year's 14.3 million
acres.

In a cotton outlook and situation summary, the department said that its
projection of a downward trend in plantings was based on current and prospective
returns for cotton relative to sorghum and soybeans.

The largest declines in cotton acreage, the department said, would be in the
Southwest and the Mississippi Delta states.  In its latest supply-demand figures
for cotton, the Agriculture Department projected total stocks for the season to
end Aug. 1, 1982, at 5.4 million bales - about double the previous year's total.

The high yields, estimated at 543 pounds an acre compared with 404 pounds an
acre in 1980, combined with unusually low abandonment of land, result in a
1981-82 cotton production estimate of 15.6 million bales.

As a result, the department said that the United States may account for more
than 80 percent of the increase in estimated 1981-82 world cotton production,
now forecast at a record 70.9 million bales, 5.5 million above the previous
year.

Cotton prices continued in a downward trend during 1981, moving from an average
of 77 cents a pound in January to 64 cents in mid-October.

Grain futures surge, farmers' hopes fade

BYLINE: Deborah Hargreaves, Financial Times of London

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 394 words

DATELINE: Chicago,IL.


  As temperatures soar in cloudless skies across the U.S. farm belt, farmers are
in fear for their crops amid a surge in farm commodity prices on Chicago's
futures exchanges.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared a drought emergency in 18 states
as cattle pasture conditions have reached their poorest levels since the Dust
Bowl of 1934. In testimony before Congress on Tuesday, Richard Lyng, U.S.
secretary of agriculture, said major parts of the U.S. are nearing a crop
disaster caused by dry weather.

Livestock farmers have been worst-hit so far as the drought has dried up
pastures and forced some of them to send cattle to market earlier than usual
because of a lack of grazing.

In the corn belt, the next two weeks are crucial to the fate of corn and soybean
crops.

''In two more weeks, we will be getting past the time for planting more soybeans
and past the point of return for corn,'' said David Senter at the American
Agriculture Movement, a farm pressure group. Farmers in Illinois can usually
plant soybeans until the beginning of July to replace seeds that did not
germinate at the first planting.

Crop yields are already expected to be low this year because the drought has
occurred so soon after farmers in the Midwest completed their plantings,
depriving seeds of moisture for germination. In addition, farmers with
irrigation systems are being forced to use them two months earlier than usual,
which substantially pushes up their costs of production.

Commodity traders at the Chicago Board of Trade have seized on the drought to
extend the surge in grain prices, which were already soaring this year, as the
U.S. pulls itself out of its farm crisis. Trading in the exchange's grain
futures contracts has been frenzied as farmers have also rushed to hedge against
crop damage in a long drought.

But grain prices have staged wide swings in the past couple of days amid
uncertainty about the outlook for the weather.

Steve Freed, grains analyst at Dean Witter, said traders on the exchange floor
have become nervous this week about the soaring prices. ''A US$9 soybean price
(per bushel) is scary; it doesn't get there very often and it's a little too
early to be getting excited about a drought. Grain traders are looking for some
indication that the drought has really set in,'' Freed said.

India Plans Purchases Of Wheat

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 22; Column 4; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 395 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12


For the first time since 1988, the Government of India will be buying wheat
abroad to bolster its stockpiles of food, Indian and American officials say.

The head of India's Food Deaprtment told the United States Agriculture
Department this week that New Delhi needs about one million tons of grain to
stabilize food prices, which have risen as a result of changes in economic
policies.

In looking for foreign wheat supplies, India is in competition with a number of
nations that were once part of the former Soviet Union. The United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization in Rome said today that 12 former Soviet republics,
excluding the Baltic nations, might buy as much as 35 million tons of grain this
year, 11 million more than last year.

Worldwide, the food organization said, the demand for wheat alone would increase
12 million tons.

American officials say there is less fear in Washington that supplies will be
strained and more concern that subsidized European grain will siphon off buyers.
American wheat sells for about $180 a ton; wheat grown in Europe under heavy
European Community subsidies sells for $130 a ton.

India, which is self-sufficient in food production, bought two million tons of
American wheat in 1988 when food stockpiles were running low. The wheat was sold
under the 1985 Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes sales of American
grain to make it more competitive with European grain.

New Delhi has asked the United States for price concessions again this year. In
the Agriculture Department, officials are inclined to support the Indian request
because India, with about 850 million people and a limited ability to expand
acreage, is seen as a long-term cash customer for American wheat.

Russia is seeking about 23 million tons on the world market this year, officials
say. But they believe that private ownership and improvements in Russian
agriculture will sooner or later make production more efficient.

The United States has made other poor South Asian nations, including Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh, eligible for the Export Enhancement Program subsidies on grain.
Asian nations with better economic performances and large trade imbalances with
the United States have been excluded. These include Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan, all of which continue to buy American wheat rather than cheaper European
grain.

'KILLER BEES' COLONY IS FOUND AND EXTERMINATED IN CALIFORNIA

BYLINE: By BAYARD WEBSTER

SECTION: Section A; Page 8, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 403 words


A colony of about 50 aggressive Africanized honey bees has been found in an
oilfield near Lost Hills in Kern County in central California, the United States
Department of Agriculture reported yesterday. The bees were killed with an
aerosol insecticide.

Large colonies of Africanized bees, often called ''killer bees,'' are now native
to sections of South and Central America and have been expected to migrate
farther north to the lower United States within the next few years. Since the
bees have been found unable to survive in cooler climates, they are expected to
migrate no further north than the Southern tier of states.

The discovery of the bees in central California, about 30 miles northwest of
Bakersfield, is not believed to be evidence of the bee's northward migration. A
normal honey bee colony contains anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000 bees. Officials
found no evidence of a comb or a queen in the burrow and found no indications of
Africanized bees in any commercial bee hives in the area. Without a queen, the
bees will not reproduce.

In recent years there have been several cases of small groups of Africanized
bees having been found in the United States. These were usually on ships
carrying hollow pipes, machinery or empty containers from South American ports.

The Federal and state authorities now theorize that the bees found in the
California oil field were probably transported by ships carrying oil-drilling
pipes and other equipment from South America.

The Africanized strain, believed to have been hybridized somewhat by breeding
with the milder European honey bee in South America, sprang from a group of true
African bees that were transported to Brazil from Africa for a research project
in the 1950's. A number of swarms escaped from the laboratories and since then
have been slowly moving north and south.

The stings of the bees, which closely resemble the European honey bees that are
employed by American beekeepers for crop pollination and honey production in all
states, are no more venomous than those of the domestic bees. They are known,
however, for their tendency to become easily aroused and mass in great numbers
to attack humans or other intruders.

An oilfield worker found the bees and notified California agricultural experts,
who killed them with the insecticide and submitted them to the Sacramento office
of the Federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

the United States' largest annual trade show for the poultry, meat, and feed
industries, building on the theme, 'Innovation in agriculture.'

Following the expo, the group will meet with US agribusiness executives and
researchers, including experts at the Georgia Tech Agriculture Technology
Research Group and Innovation Lab, to explore innovations that could benefit
Pakistan, expand bilateral trade, and create investment opportunities for US
companies.

The group will also visit a peach farm in Georgia, and conduct meetings with
Georgia' Farm Bureau, Cotton Commission, State Department of Agriculture, and
the US Department of Agriculture's Research Service.

Representatives from all four provinces of Pakistan will take part in the trade
mission, as well as officials from the Ministry of Food Security and Research,
the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif
University of Agriculture Multan.

Agriculture is Pakistan's leading industry, accounting for more than twenty
percent of GDP and two-fifths of employment.  Major products include cotton,
wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, dairy, beef, mutton, poultry and
eggs.

The United States is Pakistan's largest trading partner, exporting $447 million
in agricultural goods to Pakistan in 2015. These imports help support Pakistani
agricultural exports, which were $ 3.7 billion in fiscal year 15/16 (July-June).

U.S. terms timid plan to trim farm subsidies

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 458 words

DATELINE: Brussels BELGIUM


Reuter BRUSSELS
  The United States and the European Community have disagreed sharply at
the World Food Conference over the best way to reform agriculture and shed
costly subsidies.

Washington wants an end to all agricultural subsidies by the year 2000
and says the EC's new package of measures to curb output and spending is
timid.

But Frans Andriessen, EC Farm Commissioner, argued that for most
countries, completely dismantling all support for agriculture is neither
possible nor desirable, even in the long term.

The conference at the European Parliament in Brussels has been
organized to seek solutions to the global imbalance between huge food
surpluses in major industrial countries and chronic shortages in the Third
World.

Both the United States and the 12-nation EC subsidize their farmers
heavily, and some experts say both must stop spending so much money on
wasted food production.

Richard Lyng, U.S. Agriculture Secretary, told about 250 conference
delegates from over 60 countries that only a system devoid of subsidies
and protectionism could help developing countries and end trade friction.

'We must open markets, not restrict them. We must reject proposals  that lock in
markets and price stabilization schemes,' he said.

But the United States would continue aggressively supporting its
farmers if it did not get the results it wanted in multilateral
negotiations, he said.

Referring to the U.S. aim of abolishing subsidies, Mr. Andriessen said.
'It does not make sense to establish long-term goals while not being able
or willing to fill in intermediate steps.'
   If doing away with all subsidies was unrealistic, he told delegates,
major industrial countries could still go a long way 'toward reducing and
rebalancing agricultural support, and making it more selective.'
   The package of price cuts and other measures negotiated recently to
curb EC agricultural production was a pragmatic, immediate step in the
right direction, Mr. Andriessen added.

He also pointed out that abolishing subsidies would not magically help
Third World countries, because they would have to pay more for imports as
well as earning more for their xports.

Opening the two-day meeting, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said
major industrial nations had to take the initiative to help feed the whole
world.

'The time has come for Europe and the rest of the developed world to  take a
lead in structural adjustment efforts,' he told the conference.  'We have not
begun to think together as internationalists.'     What less-developed countries
need is aid for the kind of technology  and training that can bring about
self-sufficiency, he said. 'The answer  does not lie in dumping surplus stocks
on us through food aid, no matter  how legitimate your intentions are.'

PRICES PAID TO FARMER DOWN 2.1%

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 20, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 483 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31


Prices paid to farmers for raw products dropped 2.1 percent in August and, for
the first time in 14 months, averaged below the levels of a year earlier, the
Agriculture Department said today.

Nevertheless, the department's economists predict that retail food prices will
go up an average of 8.6 percent this year, matching last year's gain, which was
the smallest annual increase since 1977.

Scott Steele, a staff economist in the Agriculture Department, said this year's
prospects for big grain crops (including wheat, rice and corn) along with
sharply higher production of cotton and other commodities were the main reasons
for a price decline.

Moreover, he said, crop production in many other countries looks good this year.
That would mean stiffer competition for United States exports.

''It depends a lot on some of these foreign market purchases and how those come
about in the next several months,'' Mr. Steele said.  This nation's farm prices
in August averaged 138 percent of the 1977 base that is used for comparison,
against the July index of 141.

A Few Prices Higher

Lower prices for corn, cattle, soybeans, dry edible beans and cotton led the
August decline, the department's Crop Reporting Board said. But higher prices
for apples, oranges, lemons, milk, tobacco and calves offset part of the decline
for the other commodities.

The last time the monthly farm price index dropped below its level of a year
before was in June 1980. On a month-to-month basis, farm prices rose slightly
last January. Since then, they have held steady in three months and declined in
four.

The prices farmers paid to meet expenses in August rose seventenths of 1 percent
from July and averaged 7.9 percent above a year ago. Higher prices for
replacement livestock and family living items more than made up for declines in
many feed products and replacement cattle and hogs.

According to the preliminary August figures, which are based mostly on mid-month
averages, prices of meat animals as a group declined 1.3 percent from July. The
index was 6.1 percent below the level of August 1980.

The latest month's index for feed grains and hay declined 8.2 percent from July
and averaged 4.3 percent below the August 1980 level.

Decline for Vegetables

Vegetable prices at the farm dropped 3 percent from July and were 16 percent
below a year ago. Lower prices for lettuce, cantaloupes and onions contributed
most to the decrease from the previous month.  Higher prices were reported for
tomatoes and carrots.

Fruit prices collectively jumped 20 percent from July and averaged 8.3 percent
above a year ago. That included higher prices for apples, oranges, lemons,
strawberries and pears. Lower prices were reported for peaches.

Pakistan: US, Pakistani scientists increase Pakistan's wheat productivity

LENGTH: 392 words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Nov. 23 -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is helping
farmers to increase productivity and improving food security in Pakistan by
introducing disease-resistant varieties of wheat.

United States Department of Agriculture's Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project
(WPEP) has introduced 60 advanced wheat varieties in Pakistan in the first of
115 wheat trials scheduled this year at the National Agricultural Research
Council (NARC) and other locations throughout Pakistan.

USDA scientists, together with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement
Center (CIMMYT), helped researchers at the Pakistan Agricultural Research
Council (PARC) establish the annual National Uniform Wheat Yield Trial (NUWYT)
at the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC) in Islamabad. USDA helped
identify and multiply a variety of wheat called, "NARC 2011," which can resist
wheat rust. After NUWYT tests proved the variety was well-suited for the
environment in Pakistan, it was released to and is now being used by farmers.

"Wheat is critical to Pakistan's food security," said USDA Plant Health Advisor
Ian Winborne at a ceremony in NARC celebrating the establishment of the NUWYT.
"The United States is committed to working with Pakistani scientists to develop
solutions to wheat diseases that can affect crops here in Pakistan, and in the
United States. The NUWYT is an important step in finding disease-resistant wheat
varieties that will feed the people of Pakistan for years to come."

USDA's WPEP is a collaborative project focused on scientific exchanges on wheat
productivity that help develop and introduce disease-resistant varieties,
improve agronomy practices, and upgrade infrastructure in Pakistan.

Mutually beneficial scientific exchange and research is an important feature of
the work carried out by the United States and Pakistan in agriculture. U.S. and
Pakistani agricultural scientists will also deepen their cooperation at the
U.S.-funded Center for Advanced Studies on agriculture. The center is based in a
Pakistani university and hosts regular exchanges between top agricultural
scientists from the United States and Pakistan Published by HT Syndication with

IN BRIEF;
No U.S. Funds Allotted To Upgrade Plum I. Lab

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

SECTION: Section 14LI; Page 8; Column 2; Long Island Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 282 words


The White House has turned down a request by the Agricultural Research Service,
an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, for $24 million to
upgrade the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center.

The lack of funds in the budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, which
President Clinton proposed last week, means that plans for what are known as
Biosafety Level 4 laboratories on Plum Island will face delays or be dropped.

The laboratories, which would be the only ones of their kind in the United
States, would allow researchers to study deadly imported animal viruses that
infect humans. Plum Island is about a mile off the tip of the North Fork.

James S. Spurling, a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, said the
Agricultural Research Service continued to believe "it is important that we have
a Level 4 research facility." But, he added, "that doesn't mean it has to be at
Plum Island."

Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Democrat of Quogue and a member of the House
Appropriations Committee, had asked that the money be deleted from the budget.

"Research of this kind is better conducted at the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta or at the U.S.D.A. facility in Ames, Iowa, not near our heavily
populated communities here on Long Island," Mr. Forbes said. His district
includes the East End of the Island.

Mr. Forbes and other critics of the upgrade have also expressed concern about
transporting viruses for which there are no known cures by motor vehicle from
John F. Kennedy International Airport to the laboratory. Plum Island officials
respond that packaging and safety features sufficiently protected the public.

Soviet Farm Import Rise Seen

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 16, Column 2; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 289 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 13


American farmers will be getting lower prices for their huge 1981 harvests but a
thriving export market may help soften the blow, the Agriculture Department said
today.

One of the big buyers on the international market is the Soviet Union, which is
now expected to import from all foreign sources a total of 43 million metric
tons of grain during the international marketing year that will expire on June
30, 1982. That was up by 3 million tons from the estimate of a month ago. A
metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4
bushels of corn.

Last year the Soviet Union imported 34.5 million metric tons of grain, a record
at the time and close to what United States experts had believed to be its
maximum import capacity.

But the Russians ''appear to be maximizing efforts to expand'' their import
capability, the new analysis said, including improved facilities at Leningrad
and other ports.

Agriculture Department analysts last week estimated the Soviet Union's 1981
total grain harvest at 175 million metric tons, the smallest in six years and
far below Moscow's initial goal of 236 million tons.

The United States recently told the Soviet Union it could buy up to 23 million
metric tons of wheat and corn during the sixth year of a long-term purchase
agreement that runs through Sept. 30, 1982.  Purchases announced so far total
7.25 million tons.

In all, American grain production this year - which includes wheat, corn and
other feed grains, and rice -is estimated at a record 326.5 million metric tons.
Soybeans, an oilseed, add another 57.3 million tons.

Court has no beef with industry ads Cattleman had sued over 'It's What's for
Dinner' fees

BYLINE: Denver Post Staff and Wire Reports,

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C-01

LENGTH: 472 words


WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court turned aside a  free-speech challenge to the
'Beef: It's What's for Dinner'  advertising campaign by a Kansas cattleman
seeking to avoid paying  fees to help fund the ads.

The justices, without comment, refused to question a federal  appeals court
decision upholding a U.S. Department of Agriculture  order that Jerry Goetz pay
$ 137,000 in back fees and penalties.

The beef ads are under fire following a 6-3 Supreme Court  ruling in June that
struck down a similar Agriculture Department  advertising program, known as a
'checkoff,' for the mushroom  industry. A separate challenge to the $ 88 million
beef program is  pending in a federal trial court in South Dakota.

The Denver-based National Cattlemen's Beef Association  applauded the decision.

'Our initial reaction is that the court decision is a  positive,' said spokesman
Kendal Frazier. 'We believe the checkoff  is constitutional.'

But the ruling was a setback for the Rocky Mountain Farmers  Union, which
represents small farmers and ranchers in Colorado,  Wyoming and New Mexico.

'We support checkoff programs to some degree, but only to the  extent that
they're constitutional,' said spokesman William  Lee-Ashley. 'We don't think the
beef checkoff is constitutional.'

Hog farmers this year voted to kill the national pork  promotion checkoff, but
the USDA later overturned the results  after several producer groups filed
lawsuits claiming the agency  had no legal authority to hold the election in the
first place.

Goetz argued that the beef fee, a $ 1 assessment on each head  of cattle sold,
compels him to pay for messages he doesn't  necessarily support.

'The Beef Act is materially indistinguishable from the  Mushroom Act and cannot
survive a First Amendment challenge,' he  said in his appeal to the nation's
highest court.

The 15-year-old beef-promotion law pays for advertising and  promotional
activities designed to increase sales of steak,  hamburger and other beef
products.

The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice  ruled against Goetz.

The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to reject  Goetz's appeal. The
government said the mushroom ruling doesn't  necessarily mean the beef promotion
system is unconstitutional.

In a court filing last year, the Justice Department had said  the beef and
mushroom programs are 'virtually identical.' The  Supreme Court's decision in
the mushroom case surprised many  observers because the court in 1997 upheld the
fees that pay for  generic advertising for California peaches, plums and
nectarines.

The justices said the $ 2.65 million mushroom program was  different because it
wasn't part of a broader government effort to  regulate that market.

PEI potatoes denied entry into U.S.

BYLINE: JACK MacANDREW, Special to The Globe and Mail

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 402 words

DATELINE: CHARLOTTETOWN


Trucks carrying Prince Edward Island potatoes were stopped from crossing into
the United States yesterday, despite a deal struck Wednesday between the United
States Department of Agriculture and its Canadian counterpart.

Under the deal, Island table stock potatoes could begin moving freely again in
the U.S. and Canada, except those from a restricted area where the potato wart
fungal disease was found eight weeks ago.

A letter signed by the second-in-command at the American agency was sent to the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, notifying officials of the restrictions still
in effect, but opening the border to most shipments.

Yesterday, packing-house workers were called in and 11 truckloads of potatoes
moved out to fill orders from buyers in Eastern Seaboard cities of the United
States. This weekend was key to getting PEI potatoes to domestic and American
markets in time for Christmas.

But then, USDA officials at the Houlton, Me., border crossing called PEI
Agriculture Minister Mitch Murphy to tell him they had received no instructions
from Washington to let in PEI potaoes.

Mr. Murphy said he was upset at the refusal of Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle
Vanclief to immediately retaliate with restrictions against the import of
potatoes from Idaho and Wisconsin.

"He's letting this province twist in the wind while we lose more market share
with every passing day," Mr. Murphy said. "I'll tell you one thing - unless they
[the federal government] do something fast, they'd better be prepared to write a
cheque with a lot of zeros attached. Our economy is going down the drain."

Island farmers believe U.S. authorities are imposing unjustified trade sanctions
and that the potato wart does not pose a large threat.

Nearly two tonnes of Island soil and 8,000 individual soil samples have been
tested and found free of the potato-wart virus.

But the Americans refuse to accept the Canadian science, a tactic, Mr. Murphy
said, that "kept us out of the American Thanksgiving market and is designed to
keep us out of the market at Christmas."

He blamed a lobby group representing U.S. potato growers for causing the
agreement reached this week to founder.

Mr. Murphy said the potato industry accounts for one third of the Prince Edward
Island economy and a quarter of all jobs (about 15,000). Packing-house workers
have been laid off for the past seven weeks, ruling out EI cheques for many.

Washington: Senators Call On Treasury Department To Review ChemChina's
Acquisition of Syngenta

LENGTH: 890  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington, DC: U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry has
issued the following press release:


 U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), ranking member of the U.S. Senate
Agriculture Committee, today led a bipartisan letter co-signed by U.S. Senators
Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Joni Ernst (R-IA) - members of
the Senate Agriculture Committee - calling on the U.S. Department of the
Treasury to review China National Chemical Corporation's (ChemChina) proposed
acquisition of Syngenta for any potential effects on U.S. national security and
the American food system.





 "While this Committee has not reached any conclusions regarding the proposed
purchase of Syngenta by ChemChina, we believe that any foreign acquisition of an
important U.S. agricultural asset should be reviewed closely for potential risks
to our food system," the Senators said. "It is not unreasonable to suggest that
shifts in company governance; operational strategy; or financial
health--particularly in light of the magnitude of this leveraged
transaction--could have consequences for food security, food safety,
biosecurity, and the highly competitive U.S. farm sector as a whole."



 Pointing to growing investment from abroad in U.S. agriculture, the Senators
also urged Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to include both the United States
Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) when reviewing
foreign acquisitions of major U.S. agriculture assets.



 The full text of the letter to Treasury follows.



 Dear Secretary Lew:



 As members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, we
write to you regarding China National Chemical Corporation's (ChemChina)
proposed acquisition of Syngenta, a Switzerland-based crop protection and seed
company with significant operations in the United States. Despite the two
companies reported intent to voluntarily file for review with the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), chaired by the U.S. Department
of the Treasury, we respectfully request that CFIUS exercise its authority to
review this transaction to assess any potential ramifications the purchase may
have for American national security, with a specific focus on the potential
effects on food security and the safety of our food system.



 There is shared sentiment among lawmakers, military officials, and everyday
Americans that protecting the safety and resiliency of our food system is core
to American national security. Notwithstanding this widely held conviction, the
composition of the CFIUS today does not include representation from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as
formal components of its process for reviewing foreign investments in critical
American assets, including agricultural assets.



 Constituents have approached us with concerns over this transaction, citing the
2013 CFIUS review of the Shuanghui-Smithfield acquisition. The most common
reflection on that experience is that growing foreign investment in U.S.
agriculture--and the prognosis of more to come--should be met with a careful
review process that captures the issues most relevant to safeguarding the
American food system going forward.



 To that end, we believe that it is imperative that both the USDA and the FDA be
included in the CFIUS for purposes of reviewing and making decisions on this
proposed acquisition by ChemChina.



 While this Committee has not reached any conclusions regarding the proposed
purchase of Syngenta by ChemChina, we believe that any foreign acquisition of an
important U.S. agricultural asset should be reviewed closely for potential risks
to our food system. It is not unreasonable to suggest that shifts in company
governance; operational strategy; or financial health--particularly in light of
the magnitude of this leveraged transaction--could have consequences for food
security, food safety, biosecurity, and the highly competitive U.S. farm sector
as a whole.



 The risk of negative outcomes is heightened to the extent that an acquired U.S.
agricultural asset becomes in some part governed by a foreign government with
clear strategic interests. In fact, the potential for unpredictable behavior
from global farm sector participants is a great challenge for the United States
as the importance of trade to American agriculture continues to grow and food
systems become more integrated. For instance, nonmarket behavior due to
state-ownership could lead to inconsistent or seemingly arbitrary treatment of
U.S. farm products in key export markets, particularly when company governance
includes governments of countries with which the United States exchanges a high
volume of trade.



 We support the mission of CFIUS to safeguard our national security.  At the
same time, it is important that the tools and processes used to review foreign
investments in critical U.S. assets accurately reflect the full range of
national security challenges our country faces today and in the future. Thank
you for your consideration of our request and views on this important matter.

Separate Table Ruled Within Federal Law

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 8, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 196 words

DATELINE: LINCOLN, R.I., Feb. 17


Segregating elementary school pupils who buy their lunches from those who bring
them to school does not violate pupils' civil rights or Federal law, the United
States Department of Agriculture says.

The department began investigating the case in September when the American Civil
Liberties Union filed a complaint on behalf of the family of Sherry DeQuattro, a
sixth grader.

The DeQuattros said that the separation of their children and others who took
their lunches to school from those who bought a hot lunch was unfair. The
complaint said the practice violated Federal laws prohibiting the creation of
separate dining areas for children who were enrolled in Federal lunch programs.

Although there are no separate dining rooms for children enrolled in the Federal
lunch program at the Saylesville Elementary School, the Civil Liberties Union
contended the ''net effect'' of the policy was to separate participants in the
program as if there were in different dining areas.

The Department of Agriculture said it found no discrimination in this.

The school principal, Samuel Williams, said he put the plan into effect because
it made it easier to serve lunches.

Canadian trade officials and agriculture industry representatives thought they
were close to a deal with the U.S. after initial talks between Agriculture
Minister Ralph Goodale and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. The disputes
centre on exports of Canadian durum wheat, sugar and peanut butter.

Negotiations broke off Wednesday night after failure to agree even on basic
issues, such as which year to use as a base for a proposed limit on grain
exports to the U.S., said one U.S. trade official.

Goodale said yesterday he could not comment directly on negotiations but
admitted talks were not going as smoothly as they once were.

''Whether this round of talks will succeed or not, quite frankly I don't know,''
he said outside the House of Commons.

Canadian officials thought they had an agreement from Espy that the base year
would be the 1994 crop year, which ends this summer. Canada wanted that time
frame because exports are expected to reach a record 2.5 million tonnes as a
result of flooding in U.S. grain states last year.

But U.S. negotiators said they wanted a more average year, such as 1992, when
Canadian grain shipments were only 1.6 million tonnes.

The two sides also remain far apart on limits on sugar and sugar products from
Canada as well as how much market access Ottawa is prepared to offer the U.S. in
what are now protected farm products such as ice cream and yogurt.

Canada, like the other 116 countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, must table tariff proposals to the GATT by Feb. 15. Ottawa has proposed
converting existing import quotas on farm products such as cheese, eggs and
poultry to tariffs as high as 351%. The U.S. is expected to object to those high
tariffs.

Summit leaders facing critical trade issue   Reduced farm support to be
discussed

BYLINE: JENNIFER LEWINGTON and MADELAINE DROHAN; GAM

LENGTH: 1271 words


BY JENNIFER LEWINGTON and MADELAINE DROHAN The Globe and Mail
From the Canadian Prairies to French dairy farms to the rice fields of
Japan, the political stakes are high when it comes to talk of governments
reducing farm support payments at next week's Houston economic summit.

And not only are the stakes high for farmers, they are also
prohibitively high for taxpayers in the rich countries who supply the
billions of dollars paid out in domestic and export subsidies.

Currently, the seven richest industrial nations, whose leaders will
gather in Houston, are at an impasse over farm trade, although they
acknowledge that a resolution has to be found if the Uruguay Round of
world trade talks is to proceed toward a successful conclusion in
December.

The summit leaders must give a political push to the trade
negotiations, even though sharp disagreements over agricultural trade,
especially between the United States and the European Community, stand in
the way. The summit's success will test the leaders' will to find common
ground where little now exists.

One Canadian official likened the agricultural negotiators in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round to drug addicts who "require,
like a junkie, periodic injections of political will.

"If the negotiators don't get that, they'll just spin wheels."

Privately, U.S. officials are enthusiastic about compromise proposals
issued last week by Art de Zeeuw, the Dutch chairman of the agricultural
negotiating group at GATT, the 97-member world body that oversees global
trade. But the initial EC response was cool, making the United States wary
about sounding too keen on the draft GATT proposals.

One senior Canadian official, noting the dramatic changes sweeping
across Europe, said that "if there's ever a time to do something (on
agriculture) in Europe, it's now."

On Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the GATT paper
offers "a good framework for negotiations." She said the proposals had
some "pluses and minuses" but would not elaborate to reporters.

In Houston, the summiteers have neither the time, interest nor skill to
resolve their differences over protectionist farm policies. But the GATT
paper offers the leaders some political cover to show progress on the
thorny issue without getting bogged down in details.

"It does (provide cover), if they want to use it," one U.S. trade
official said yesterday. Without some breakthrough on agriculture, the
summit leaders will have difficulty putting meat on the bones of the
existing draft communique.

The United States and the EC are the key adversaries in the debate over
agricultural trade reforms. But the battle is more than a protracted
harangue across the Atlantic Ocean.

Developing countries, dependent on exporting farm and other commodities
to the industrial world, look to the Uruguay Round to dismantle the
pervasive, expensive system of farm price supports and export subsidies
financed by taxpayers and consumers in the industrial world. GATT puts the
price tag at $250-billion (U.S.) a year.

Without a deal on agriculture, the developing countries will not
liberalize their markets to investors and others in the industrial world.

Canada and 13 other farm exporting nations who are members of the so-
called Cairns group meet today in Santiago, Chile, to discuss the GATT
proposals to cut farm payments, export subsidies and import barriers.
Canada will speak at the Houston summit for the Cairns group, which was
formed several years ago to promote freer farm trade.

Since the Uruguay Round 3 years ago, the United States has called for
dramatic reforms to eliminate all subsidies and price supports over time.
U.S. complaints about trade distorting farm policies are not confined to
the EC. Washington sees Canada's system of marketing boards, including
dairy, as a barrier to competition from south of the border. And the
United States has long-standing complaints about Japan's import
restrictions that protect domestic rice farmers.

Despite its purist views, the United States is a sinner too, with an
elaborate and expensive system of restrictive quotas, export subsidies and
production incentives.

Canada, which supports the ambitious U.S. goals on farm trade reform,
is also schizophrenic about farm support. It favors freer farm trade for
grain and beef because Canadian producers of those goods believe they can
compete internationally as long as other countries eliminate their export
subsidies.

It's a different story for the dairy and poultry sectors, which operate
under a system of supply management. The Canadian system tries to match
domestic supply and demand, using import restrictions to maintain the
balance.

Canada wants to retain its supply management system, despite its trade
restrictive features. In this, Canada has run afoul of the Cairns group,
which objects to Canada's attempt to shield its domestic program from
international reforms.

For its part, the 12-nation EC resists any meaningful assault on its
Common Agriculture Policy, which particularly benefits French and West
German farmers. U.S. officials say the EC farm program encourages
overproduction by setting high prices to boost domestic production. In
turn, the EC sells the surplus in third-country markets at a low price,
undercutting competitors from the United States, Canada and other farm
exporters.

One Canadian official summed up the dilemma for the summit leaders,
each with their own domestic political pressures on agriculture: "For
every leader, the politics of this are awful."

In the GATT talks so far, the EC offers a limited approach to farm
reform through reductions in the so-called "aggregate measure of support."
By this calculation, the EC could achieve an over-all reduction by cutting
support for internal production, exports or import barriers.

However, the United States contends that this formula is too vague,
since it permits the EC to raise support for internal production, for
example, while cutting export subsidies. U.S. officials point out that EC
price supports for some products are twice as high as the world price.
Thus, short of a 50 per cent reduction in these EC prices, the United
States and Canada, among others, believe the cuts would not be
significant.

This week, Mrs. Hills held to the United States' line that a meaningful
package on agriculture must include a formula for cutting internal price
supports, export subsidies and import barriers. "Agriculture is a key to
the (Uruguay) Round," she said, "it would be extremely helpful if all the
parties (at the summit) recognized that and urged trade ministers to move
with alacrity."

Time is running out for the Uruguay Round. In three weeks, the trade
negotiating committee of GATT meets to draft frameworks for all 15 subject
areas, including agriculture, covered by the multilateral talks that wrap
up in Brussels this December.

However, six weeks ago at a meeting of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development in Paris, a forerunner of the Houston summit,
the divisions between the United States and the EC ran so deep on the farm
issue that the final communique only stated the two opposing views.

Dale Hathaway, a former senior U.S. Department of Agriculture official
and now a Washington consultant, is skeptical that the Houston summit will
produce a breakthrough on agriculture.

"Either the U.S. drops its demands or the Europeans go back for a new
mandate (on agriculture)," he said. "Neither is going to happen
politically at this point."

He said he will be "surprised" if the summit does more than extoll the
virtues of a successful Uruguay Round, including agriculture. Even with
such a bland statement, the summit leaders will likely declare their
three-day session a success.

School Lunch Chief Charged In Theft of Food for Nightclub

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

SECTION: Section 1; Page 29, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 317 words


The school lunch director for public schools in Hempstead, L.I., was arrested
yesterday on charges of stealing food from the lunch program.

Officials said Samuel V. Eveleno, who was in charge of food donated by the
United States Deparment of Agriculture, used the food in a Huntington nightclub,
where he had the food concession.

The complaint, filed by the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, said 50 to 60 cases were taken by Mr. Eveleno since August 1987, when
he became operator of the Backstage Cafe in the East Side Comedy Club. In the
complaint, a special agent for the United States Department of Agriculture,
Stephen T. Grogan, said an employee of Mr. Eveleno had told him that the
defendant usually took the food to the cafe every other week.

The food included American, mozzarella and cheddar cheese; raisins; peanuts;
tomatoes; refried beans; tomato paste; honey; spaghetti; butter; french fried
and instant mashed potatoes; fish nuggets, and mixed vegetables, the complaint
said. It did not list the value of the food.

Mr. Grogan said the diversion was discovered when a Suffolk County health
inspector in a routine inspection of the cafe discovered 320 pounds of federally
donated food. Mr. Grogan said other Government food was observed on three later
visits.

Mr. Eveleno, 56 years old, of Greenlawn, L.I., was arraigned before Magistrate
Carol B. Amon and released on his own recognizance. Neither he nor his lawyer,
Stephen C. Worth would make a comment. If Mr. Eveleno is convicted, he would
face five years' in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000.

An assistant school superintendent, James Galloway, said that Mr. Eveleno did
''not work for the public school system'' and that he was employed by a
subcontractor, Preferred Meals, part of TW Services Inc. Mr. Galloway said the
lunch program served 2,500 of the 5,200 students in the district.

CBP Preclearance in Shannon, Ireland Welcomes New Agriculture Canine Enforcement
Team

LENGTH: 417  words

DATELINE: Washington


Customs and Border Protection, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

U.S. Customs and Border Protection recently welcomed a new agriculture canine
enforcement team to the Preclearance facility in Shannon, Ireland. "Kingston," a
two-year-old beagle, arrived in Ireland in early August and was reunited with
his handler, CBP Agriculture Specialist
"Kingston and I are excited to be the first line in defending American
agriculture from harmful pests and disease prior to them entering the U.S. as
the only agriculture canine team at a Preclearance facility," said CBPAS Hall.
"Being a part of a canine detection team is not only one of the greatest jobs
there is at CBP, but it is also one of the most important."

The more than 116 CBP agriculture canine teams at ports of entry, land borders
and mail facilities are the front line in the fight against the introduction of
harmful insects and disease into the United States. Every pest or disease
intercepted could cause million in damages to U.S. agriculture. CBP agriculture
specialists' vigilance helps protect America's farms, forests and natural
resources.

"We are very pleased to have CBP Agriculture Specialist Hall and her K-9 partner
Kingston on board here in Shannon Preclearance," said (Acting) Port Director
Gregory Starr. "The CBP agriculture mission is an integral part of our
processing and we are extremely fortunate to have this canine team asset at our
Preclearance location."

Prior to arriving in Ireland, the team completed a mandatory U.S. Department of
Agriculture training at the National Detector Dog Training Center (USDA NDDTC)
in Georgia. All the detector canines at USDA NDDTC are adopted from rescue
shelters in the U.S., like Kingston was, or gifted through private donations.
CBPAS Hall joined CBP in 2005 and became a canine handler in 2007.

CBP Preclearance operations allow for advance inspection of passengers and
special coordination with law enforcement upon arrival in the United States.
Through preclearance, the same immigration, customs, and agriculture inspections
of international air passengers performed on arrival in the United States are
instead completed before departure at foreign airports.  Currently, preclearance
operations exist at 15 foreign airports in six different countries, benefitting
air passengers, airports, and air carriers, in the United States and abroad.

A Battle Over Beetles Takes On Urgency

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

SECTION: Section A; Page 28; Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 646 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18


Tree experts around New York City and Chicago are girding for a warm-weather
offensive against a creature, little more than an inch long, that could destroy
as much woodland as some of the worst forest fires in history.

The creature is the Asian long-horned beetle, which kills trees by eating them
from the inside and which has no natural enemies in the United States. Once a
tree is infected, it is doomed. Thousands of trees have been felled and ground
into bits to try to check the beetles' advance.

Federal and state agriculture officials have spent several million dollars and
expect to spend millions more in fighting the beetle, which was first spotted in
the United States four years ago.

The United States Department of Agriculture has assigned some of its top experts
to the campaign. Now, the department and the Environmental Protection Agency are
weighing whether to use a nicotine-based pesticide, one they think would carry
minimal risks to people and other trees.

"This is potentially a very, very serious problem," Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said in a recent interview.

Officials say huge tracts of forest could be ruined. Vermont, which relies on
maple trees for its syrup business and its famed autumn foliage, has particular
reason to worry. Maples are among the many trees the beetle loves to dine on,
although none of the creatures have been spotted in the state.

Female beetles bore deep into trees to lay eggs. The larvae then eat their way
out, flying away and leaving their doomed hosts pocked with perfectly round
holes. Because adult beetles are active only in the summer and fall, officials
are mapping plans now.

Mr. Glickman and several others said that they were optimistic and that this
year would be the turning point. They think the nicotine-based pesticide will
work even though others have not. But they conceded that there was a long battle
ahead.

"We're going to eradicate it," said Vic Mastro, an entomologist with the
Department of Agriculture. "It's not going to be an easy or short process. But
we said that at the beginning."

In the beginning, there was Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The beetle's first known
outpost in this country was discovered there in 1996, after the beetle-colonists
traveled from China in a shipping container.

Before long, the beetles were found in other sections of Brooklyn, then in parts
of Queens and Manhattan. Soon, they were in Amityville, and then elsewhere on
Long Island. More than 4,000 trees were cut down in the New York region, some of
them magnificent giants that were saplings when Lincoln was president.

"We thought we had it off the mainland," said Joe Gittleman, the Agriculture
Department's leading beetle fighter in New York State.

So there was a sense of dread in 1998 when the beetles were found in the Chicago
area, perhaps because young beetles hitched a ride on a truck fender, or in logs
from infected trees. More than 1,000 trees have been cut down around Chicago.

The Forest Service and local agencies have been planting new trees, of species
less susceptible to the beetles, but it will be years before they are as tall as
the ones that were lost.

Officials say the Chinese have agreed to treat wooden shipping pallets, in an
effort to stop more beetles from coming to the United States. Quarantines have
been imposed on firewood from areas where infected trees have been found.

Ken Kruse, the Agriculture Department's beetle-campaign leader in Chicago, said
tree trimmers and landscapers had been very cooperative in identifying and
destroying infected trees. "But how do you get the last one?" he asked.

Still, although the battle is long and hard, it is also interesting for
scientists who were not previously familiar with the Asian long-horned beetle.
"It's something you could spend a career on," Mr. Mastro said. Not that he wants
to.

U.S. Receives Assurance From Japan on Beef Exports

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO and DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

SECTION: Section A; Column 5; National Desk; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 867 words

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 14


The United States Agriculture Department won assurance from the Japanese
government on Tuesday that a second potential case of mad cow disease found on
American soil would not affect negotiations to resume beef exports to Japan, the
top American export market.

But critics of the department's mad cow testing program said the case
underscored the need for more intensive testing to determine how prevalent the
fatal, brain-wasting disease was in the American herd.

The Agriculture Department said Friday that it had found bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in an animal that had tested negative last
November. It would be the second case of the disease to be found in the United
States, and the fifth in North America, since 2003.

On Monday Taiwan, which had resumed imports of American beef two months ago, and
South Korea, which had been negotiating to restart them, expressed concern about
the new case. Taiwanese officials said that if a final round of testing
confirmed the disease that it would cease importing American beef. The news
helped sink cattle future prices to their lowest level in 13 months.

But beef prices recovered slightly on Tuesday after Japanese officials said the
latest discovery would not derail plans to restart exports to Japan, which
imported $1.4 billion worth of American beef in 2003, or 36 percent of all
American exports.

''This incident will not have any impact on our process,'' Shin Yokoyama,
Japan's agriculture counselor to the United States, said in an interview about
the negotiations. Mr. Yokoyama said his government was not bothered by the
discovery because the animal was older than 20 months, the cutoff age for
accepting beef into Japan.

''If this cow is born in the United States and raised in the United States it
still doesn't matter,'' Mr. Yokoyama said. ''As long as it is old.'' Japan,
which has been testing all its cattle since September 2001, has found 20 cases,
the most recent on June 6.

American agriculture officials said more tests would be conducted on the small
amount of remaining brain tissue from the animal at a laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
and at the world's premier mad cow testing facility, in Weybridge, England. The
process could take up to two weeks.

Taiwan, Japan and South Korea were among 53 countries that banned American beef
after mad cow was discovered in December 2003 in a dairy cow in Washington
State. Through intense lobbying, the Bush administration has restored about
one-third of its beef exports.

American officials have emphasized that there is no risk to humans from the
animal that tested positive on Friday because it was destroyed and did not get
into the animal or human food supply. The cow found in Washington had been sold
as hamburger.

So far, officials have released little else about the latest potential case,
other than that the cow was at least eight years old and was most likely not
imported.

The cow's origin could prove critical to efforts to restore the American beef
trade. In trying to bless the American herd as mad cow-free, American officials
have emphasized that the Washington cow was born in Canada before a 1997 feed
ban. The United States banned live cattle from Canada after mad cow was
discovered in a Canadian cow in May 2003.

In the latest American case, the cow tested positive only after the Office of
Inspector General, an independent watchdog group within the Agriculture
Department, required the use of a second type of test on three suspect animals
first tested in November.

Critics of the Agriculture Department asked Tuesday why the department had
refused for more than six months to perform the tests, called Western
blot.Michael K. Hansen, a senior research associate at Consumers Union, produced
copies of letters he wrote in January to the department's chief veterinary
officer and in February to the new secretary of agriculture, Mike Johanns,
asking the department to use the Western blot test on the cow's brain. He said
the newest test, used in Europe and Japan, where more mad cow cases have
surfaced, is 1,000 times more sensitive than the test used by the Agriculture
Department, the immunohistochemistry test.

In a letter dated March 18, an agriculture official replied that the department
did not think a Western blot test ''would have enhanced the result of our
November 2004 testing,'' and did not think that confirmatory testing in England
was necessary.

In the past, the Agriculture Department has repeatedly called its
immunohistochemistry test the ''gold standard'' for detection. But tests in
Belgium and Japan have shown, Dr. Hansen said, that it missed some cases. Ed
Loyd, an Agriculture Department spokesman, said the department made use of both
tests but usually used the Western blot test only when samples began to degrade.
''This is an instance where we had a very good sample.''

Since the discovery of the first mad cow case in 2003 the department enhanced
its surveillance program, testing 375,000 cattle, up from fewer than 20,000, and
testing high-risk ''downer'' cattle that are struggling to walk. But discussions
are underway to end the testing program, Mr. Loyd said.

US GIVES TEXAS BIRD FLU ALL-CLEAR

SECTION: 1st Edition; NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 359 words


The United States of America considers itself free from highly pathogenic avian
influenza.

Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC, said
that the avian influenza virus strain (H5N2) detected in one non-commercial
flock and two live bird markets (LBMs) in Gonzalez County, Texas, had been
completely eradicated.

"Six months have passed since the detection and eradication of the virus strain,
and the completion of cleaning and disinfection of all the affected premises
(LBMs and backyard flock).

"Targeted and extensive surveillance has not detected any further evidence of
the virus," he said. "Also, as previously mentioned, with the successful
eradication of the virus, the State quarantine orders on affected premises were
released. The virus has been completely stamped out and in accordance with
Article 2.1.14.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, the United States of
America considers itself free from highly pathogenic avian influenza."

Meanwhile highly pathogenic avian influenza has been reported in Peninsular
Malaysia for the first time.

Dr Hawari Bin Hussein, Director General, Department of Veterinary Service,
Ministry of Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur, said that the disease had been detected
in one flock of village chickens consisting of 60 birds of mixed ages reared
free-range.

He said that the source of agent/origin of infection was under investigation.

Dr Bin Hussein pointed out that, within a one-kilometre radius of the affected
flock, there were a further 103 village chickens, 62 birds of mixed species and
eight ducks (173 birds). All these birds are clinically healthy and were also
reared free range.

Control measures are in force. Depopulation of poultry and birds within a
one-kilometre radius of the infected flock is ongoing, as well as quarantine and
clinical surveillance within a 10km radius of the infected flock.

Restrictions on the movement of birds and their products to other states are in
force along with clinical surveillance in the whole of Kelantan State.

EU faces battle on farm subsidies

BYLINE: BRIDGE NEWS

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 219 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The United States and members of South America's Mercosur trade bloc met Monday
to form a common strategy against the European Union's agricultural subsidies.

Both Mercosur and the United States are expected to pressure the EU to do more
to remove such subsidies at the next round of World Trade Organization talks,
which the United States will host. The talks are scheduled to begin Nov. 30 in
Seattle.

That gathering could yield a new round of world trade negotiations that is
expected to center on issues of agricultural trade, on which the United States
and Europe have split sharply.

Agriculture ministers from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as
associate Mercosur members Chile and Bolivia, met with U.S. Secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman here to reaffirm their will to work together.

Mr. Glickman told reporters that Washington hopes to push for lower subsidies of
agricultural exports as well as a discussion on health standards.

Paraguayan Agriculture Minister Luis Alberto Wagner said there will be meetings
to craft a common strategy ahead of the WTO gathering.

""There are more points of agreement than disagreement, and we will focus on the
few problems in order to resolve our differences,'' said Uruguayan Agriculture
Minister Ignacio Zorrilla de San Martin.

OECD members target farm subsidies  Agriculture ministers agree on reduction,
but disagree on timing and how to do it

Agriculture ministers from the world's richest countries agreed yesterday to
reduce export subsidies on farm products, but they were not able to agree on how
or when, according to Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief.

Mr. Vanclief met with his counterparts in Paris from the other 28 countries in
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday and
Thursday to set a common course for future agriculture trade policy.

Everyone agreed to address trade barriers in the agriculture industry and to
target price-distorting subsidies in the next round of agriculture talks at the
World Trade Organization, scheduled to start at the end of 1999, Mr. Vanclief
said.

"The sense was clearly that was the direction we want to go," he said in a
conference call from Paris. But the methods and pace of reducing trade barriers
were the subjects of much debate, he said.

"From the Canadian perspective, I know that we have made good strides among the
leaders quite frankly as far as liberalizing trade, and that shows very clearly
[in the final communiqué].

"But we must be cautious that we do not move further without the others, so that
our industry is treated fairly compared to those in the other members of the
OECD. . . . One cannot get out of step."

Consumers and taxpayers in the OECD spent $280-billion (U.S.) on agricultural
policies in 1997, or about 1.3 per cent of gross domestic product for the group,
the OECD communiqué said.

That the ministers were actually able to sign a communiqué was significant.
Agriculture has always been a troublesome issue in global trade talks because of
the high subsidies and tariffs in the industry; this meeting was no different.
The United States was vociferous in its attack on protectionism, while Japan,
with its many small farms, was far more reluctant to drop protectionist
measures. And France, which relies on farm subsidies to prop up incomes, clashed
with the European Union proposals to cut farm support.

While the ministers emphasized the need to foster free trade in agriculture,
they also recognized the need to use government policy to support rural culture
and other social policy goals.

And the ministers vowed to take food safety concerns into account, and allow
actions to protect the environment and sustainable development, despite concerns
from Canada and the United States that these measures could become trade
barriers.

"All that type of activity must be science-based and cannot be emotionally
based," Mr. Vanclief warned.

Mr. Vanclief is meeting today with agriculture ministers of the so-called Quint
group of key agriculture exporters -- Canada, the United States, the European
Union, Australia and Japan. They hope to nail down more details for the next WTO
round of agriculture talks in 1999. Canada is expected to be under attack for
its supply management policies and the Canadian Wheat Board.

RECORD U.S. WHEAT CROP FORECAST

BYLINE: By SETH S. KING, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 1, Column 6; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 611 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10


The Agriculture Department today predicted a record American wheat crop for the
second consecutive year, giving the United States greater flexibility in
negotiating additional grain sales to the Soviet Union.

The department's latest crop report, which followed yesterday's offer to resume
selling grain to the Russians, estimated that the 1981 winter wheat harvest
would be 2.01 billion bushels, or 54.8 million metric tons. This would be 6
percent larger than last year's crop but 3 percent less than the department
forecast in May.

Although the per-acre yield is expected to be about one bushel less than last
year, farmers have planted 10 percent more acreage in winter wheat than last
year, the department said in its report on conditions as of June 1.

The Agriculture Department also released its latest monthly forecast of how much
grain the world's farmers will grow in the 1981-82 crop year. It predicted total
world grain production of 1.64 billion metric tons, slightly less than was
estimated last month but still about 5 percent above the 1980-81 total.

Outlook for Soviet Harvest

The June 1 forecast of Soviet grain production was unchanged from the 210
million tons predicted a month before. This total would fall short of the Soviet
target by more than 26 million tons, indicating that the Russians again might
have to import large supplies of grain to maintain their livestock herds.

After two days of talks with the Russians in London, the United States said
yesterday that the Soviet Union would be allowed to start buying American grain
again if it wished to do so.

Winter wheat, the principal bread variety that accounts for threefourths of the
wheat grown in the United States, is planted in October or November and is ripe
by early summer of the following year. America's winter wheat harvest has
already started in the Southwest.

It is still too early for the Agriculture Department to estimate this year's
American production of spring wheat because the crop has just been planted.
Spring wheat, which includes varieties used in pasta and pastries, will be
harvested early next fall.

This month's report on pasture conditions in the upper Middle West, where spring
wheat is grown, showed a shortage of moisture in that area. This could mean
smaller spring wheat yields.

Bigger Plantings Reported

But the department's wheat situation report in mid-May noted sharply increased
plantings of spring wheat, indicating that this year's total wheat production in
the United States would probably reach 2.7 billion bushels. This would be nearly
15 percent above last year's record of 2.4 billion bushels.

As the new wheat crop year began last week, American wheat farmers had a
carry-over, or surplus, of about 950 million bushels, the largest since 1978. If
the present crop does reach 2.7 billion bushels, the total supply for the
1981-82 crop year will be one of the largest in history.

Even if the United States manages to export nearly two-thirds of its total
production, as it often does, the 1981 carryover will be very large, placing
wheat prices under downward pressure.

Such pressure would be eased if the Russians buy most of the three million tons,
or about 111 million bushels, of wheat from the 1980 crop that was offered for
sale to them at yesterday's grain talks in London. Prices that American farmers
get would be helped even more if the Russians should order, for delivery next
winter, an additional three million tons from the 1981 crop, also offered
yesterday.

Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said he and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy have tentative plans to meet in Toronto Monday to discuss various trade
disputes between the two countries. The officials are expected to discuss, among
other things, Canadian shipments of durum wheat and dairy products to the U.S.
The U.S. has turned up the heat in recent days, threatening to take unilateral
action againt Canadian wheat and dairy exports as well as other commodities if
no agreement is reached next week. ''All of the issues that we have been
discussing remain on the table,'' Goodale said. ''None of them have been
resolved and none of them have gone away.''

Canada-U.S. farm trade talks break off   Espy seeks reduction of Canada's dairy,
egg   and poultry protection, and concessions on wheat

BYLINE: MADELAINE DROHAN; GAM

  MARRAKESH
 Negotiations between Canada and the United States on a bilateral farm
dispute broke off yesterday with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy
taking a tough line on Canada's continued protection of its dairy, egg and
poultry producers.

Mr. Espy made it clear that for a resolution to be reached in the
talks, which resume today, Canada will have to reduce that protection.

"Supply management is just not a system that's consistent with the
doctrine of free trade," he said, emerging from a meeting with Canadian
Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale, International Trade Minister Roy
MacLaren and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.

Mr. Espy's comments could be bluster in order to force concessions on
wheat exports to the United States, which are also in dispute. Or it could
be that the United States wants to win on both counts.

This will dismay Canadian officials who believed the question of
protection for dairy, egg and poultry producers was settled as part of the
world trade deal reached by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade in December. Indeed, the Canadians believed they'd finessed the
United States by acceding to its demand that import quotas be replaced by
tariffs, and then setting the tariffs extraordinarily high. On butter, for
example, Canada will start with a tariff of $4.71 a kilogram, reducing it
over five years to $4.

Not surprisingly, a U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis of the
impact of the world trade deal indicates no gains for U.S. farmers in
these Canadian markets.

"Canada tariffied at prohibitive levels, extremely high levels," Mr.
Espy said. "That's very creative. Very innovative. But it's not trade
creating."

Mr. Goodale said he wasn't optimistic or pessimistic that the two sides
would reach a deal when they returned to the table today. And he rejected
the supposed April 22 deadline, saying it was something the United States
had pulled out of thin air.

He said it was only scheduling problems that prevented the two sides
from meeting again last night. The U.S. side was tied up with the visit of
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore and a bilateral meeting with the Japanese.

And while he would not elaborate on the issues still dividing the two
sides, Mr. Goodale indicated he would not reject out of hand a cap on
wheat exports to the United States. "I regard the idea of a cap as
something that is certainly not desirable, but I've also gone on to say
that as a practical matter, whether a cap at some point becomes acceptable
depends on a number of things." They include what the limit is, how long
it is in effect and what other changes would be made affecting wheat
exports.

While the United States is not threatening to reject the world trade
deal until these bilateral matters are settled, they could become part of
the debate in Congress, which has to ratify the GATT deal before it
becomes law in the United States.

The Canadian Parliament also has to pass legislation to implement the
deal. This is expected in September this year.

A long-simmering dispute between Canada and Australia over beef imports
to Canada also came to a boil yesterday with Australia launching action
under the GATT to force Canada to provide more access to its markets.

Although Canada has been preoccupied with bilateral talks with the
United States, the reason the trade ministers are in town is the official
ending of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. GATT officials
said the number of participants in the round has risen in recent days to
125 from 121 after several former colonies of GATT members opted to join.

THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE EXPORTERS' CLIP AND SAVE SERVICE AGRICULTURE IN U.S.
FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY

SECTION: EXPORTS, Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 867 words


BACKGROUND: U.S. agricultural exports make an important contribution to U.S.
foreign policy objectives. One priority of U.S. policy is to work toward a more
open, equitable trading environment, which should result in improved export
opportunities for U.S. agricultural products.

Another priority is greater cooperation in food aid, food security and
gricultural economic development in developing countries.

The United States participates in international organizations that address
global food issues.

U.S. AGRICULTURAL TRADE: Agricultural products accounted for about 12 percent of
U.S. exports and earned $ 35.3 billion in fiscal year 1988, compared with 19
percent and $ 44 billion in 1981, a peak year.

Although the United States is still the major exporter of coarse grains and
soybeans, and one of the largest suppliers of wheat, cotton, meat and
horticultural products, the U.S. position has been eroding because of increased
competition, primarily from the European Community and several developing
countries. Nevertheless, agriculture is one of the few sectors where the United
States consistently registers a trade surplus.

The United States is also an important market for agricultural products from
around the world. U.S. imports increased from $ 17 billion in fiscal year 1981
to $ 21 billion in fiscal year 1988. Coffee is the single largest import.

PROBLEMS IN AGRICULTURE: The volume of world trade in agriculture has been
declining in the 1980s. Government policies and support programs have cushioned
agricultural producers from the need to adjust to market changes caused by
improved technology and slower growth in demand.

The result has been chronic surpluses and huge government expenditures to
support agriculture. Unfortunately, in many cases the programs do not target the
neediest farmers. In 1981, the United States spent $ 4 billion on farm programs;
by 1986, the figure had jumped to $ 26 billion, before falling to $ 22.4 billion
in 1987.

World prices for most major crops rose in 1988 because of the drought and caused
U.S. spending on farm programs to drop sharply to $ 12.5 billion.

Without a change in agricultural policies, however, the problems caused by
oversupply and low prices are likely to re-emerge.

AGRICULTURAL TRADE POLICY: The Bush administration has placed a high priority on
resolving agricultural problems at the multilateral and bilateral levels. The
United States was instrumental in getting agriculture on the agenda for the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations that began in September 1986.

Insisting that comprehensive and expeditious negotiations are the best way to
tackle the global problem in agricultural trade, the administration is
encouraging other governments to join it in making agricultural reform a
priority.

Last April, the United States and its Uruguay Round trading partners
successfully concluded a framework agreement on agriculture that specifies the
objectives and timetable for the multilateral agriculture negotiations. The
United States also is working in the 24-nation Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development based in Paris to develop a consensus on the urgent
need for agricultural reform.

On the bilateral side, the main thrust of administration efforts is to maintain
and improve market access for U.S. products. For wheat and certain other
commodities, the United States selectively provides export subsidies through the
Export Enhancement Program to compete with subsidized agricultural exports of o
ther countries.

PROMOTION PROGRAMS: Trade promotion is an important means of boosting farm
exports. U.S. embassies overseas promote the following programs:

* Commodity Credit Corp. credits and credit guarantees have received broad
acceptance. In fiscal year 1988, U.S. agricultural sales were assisted by CCC
credits and guarantees totaling more than $ 4.5 billion. Mexico, Iraq, Brazil,
South Korea and Portugal together account for more than half this amount.

* PL-480 (Food for Peace) aid has proved to be a long-term market development
tool as well as a means of meeting economic development and other foreign policy
goals. Several countries, including Brazil, South Korea, Turkey, Spain and
Yugoslavia, have "graduated" from the PL-480 program to become large commercial
customers for products formerly provided on concessional credit.

* One of the most successful agricultural export promotion efforts is the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Cooperator Market Development Program. This brings
together more than 50 non-profit agricultural commodity associations with the
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service in market development activities throughout
the world. The program enables the U.S. government and private industry to pool
resources, so that each gets more mileage out of such activities.

Washington offers Soviets new subsidized wheat deal

BYLINE: (REUTER)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 460 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The United States on Friday offered the Soviet Union
another 2.35 million metric tons of subsidized wheat in an apparent bid to
entice Moscow to continue its agricultural buying binge.

The agriculture department said the wheat was offered to Moscow under its export
subsidy program, called export enhancement.

Since April, the Soviet Union has purchased over 5.7 million tons of American
wheat at cut-rate prices. The new offer means the United States has offered
Moscow 8.8 million tons of subsidized wheat this year, in three separate
installments, totaling more than 10 percent of the entire U.S. wheat crop.

Washington offered 4.0 million tons to Moscow on April 30 and 2.4 million on
Nov. 9 as well as the 2.35 million announced on Friday.

A senior agriculture department official said the new offer was responding to
Soviet grain import needs.

Another offer

"Since they had now bought 1.7 million tons of the 2.4 (offer on Nov. 9) we
thought we should respond with another offer," said Tom Kay, administrator of
the agriculture department's Foreign Agricultural Service.

He said the quantity 2.35 million tons was decided upon because "they (Soviets)
ran that figure by us."

Meanwhile, European Community (EC) traders said in Brussels that they sold
nearly 1.0 million tons of bread-making wheat to the Soviet Union at just over a
third of the price it pays its own farmers. The deal handed European traders the
latest round in a seven-year fight with the United States for Moscow's market.

In recent weeks, Moscow also has bought 1.6 million tons of wheat from the
United States under a previous subsidy offer, 1.6 million tons of corn, 1.3
million tons of soybean meal and 800,000 tons of soybeans, according to the
agriculture department. The corn, soybean meal and soybeans were purchased
without the aid of a U.S. government subsidy.

The wheat sales are subsidized by providing private export traders who sign
sales contracts with Moscow with a certificate that entitles them to receive
surplus U.S. commodities in government storage. The amount of commodities
provided to the traders are enough to bridge the gap between high U.S. wheat
prices and depressed world market prices.

The EC has a different export subsidy program that has similar effects.

Fierce competition between the United States and EC for the lucrative Soviet
market has kept world wheat prices at depressed levels this year despite reduced
production in some key countries such as India, farm analysts said.

Some Soviet farm analysts have also speculated that the buying spree by Moscow
may be timed just before the superpower summit in early December between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

Farm Price Index Declines by 1.8%

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: Section 1; Page 62; Column 3; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 146 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31


Lower prices for wheat, corn, oranges, cattle and milk pushed the farm price
index down by 1.8 percent in December, the United States Agriculture Department
said on Monday.

The index, a gauge of prices paid to farmers for their crops and livestock, had
a December reading of 108, down from 110 in November but unchanged from a year
ago.

Wheat dipped 12 cents, to an average of $4.02 a bushel, and was 86 cents below
the price in December 1995. The department said projected increases in world
wheat output caused prices at home to fall.

Corn prices were driven lower by the third-largest United States crop on record.
Corn was $2.56 a bushel, off 10 cents from November and 51 cents from December
1995.

Milk prices continued to decline after hitting a record high in September,
easing to $14.20 for one hundred pounds in December, down 80 cents from
November.

Washington: Progreso Port of Entry CBP Agriculture Specialists Intercept Rare
First in Nation Pest in Cut Flowers

LENGTH: 262  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 Agriculture specialists with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of
Field Operations (OFO) at the Progreso International Bridge import cargo lot
intercepted a rare "First in Nation" pest in a shipment of cut flowers.



 "The interception of this unique, first in nation pest is an outstanding
example of the diligence and dedication of our CBP agriculture specialists in
safeguarding the agriculture of the United States," said Port Director Nestor
Garza III, Progreso Port of Entry.



 The interception occurred on Feb. 17, at the Progreso International Bridge
import lot when a shipment of cut flowers was referred to agriculture for
inspection.  Upon inspection of the cut flowers, CBP agriculture specialists
intercepted the pest on Dracaena sp. leaves.  The pest was submitted for
identification to a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist. The initial
identification was later confirmed by a national specialist as Charidotis
vitreata (Perty), a pest not known to occur in the United States and intercepted
for the first time at a port of entry. This insect belongs to the Chrysomelidae
family, commonly known as leaf beetles.  Many leaf beetles are serious pests of
cultivated plants, and a few act as vectors of plant diseases.



 Given the quarantine status of Charidotis vitreata (Perty), the cut flowers
were destroyed as a precautionary measure.

OECD SESSION RAPS US MOVE ON FARM TRADE

BYLINE: BRUCE BARNARD; Journal of Commerce Staff (Keith Rockwell contributed to
this story.)

SECTION: FRONT, Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 922 words

DATELINE: PARIS


The United States came under fire here for attempting to bring farm trade
negotiations from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to a meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperatio n and Development.

The United States made a "serious" mistake by trying to negotiate here, Frans
Andriessen, the EC's trade commissioner, charged. "If you try to negotiate here,
you damage the whole process (of the GATT Uruguay Round)," he aid.

U.S. officials, however, said the community's hard line stance on agriculture
has isolated Brussels from the other members of the OECD. Ministers from New
Zealand, Canada, and Australia strongly criticized the community's position
during heated debate Wednesday.

"It's starting to become clearer and clearer that people are tired of this. We
are not the only ones," said one U.S. official.

Community plans for addressing the question of reducing farm subsidies remain
vague, the official said, while the United States and other grain producers seek
to develop a mechanism for cutting such support.

"They are still talking about overall, emcompassing aggregate issues, and we're
trying to solve the problem," the official continued.

The long-simmering dispute between the United States and the European Community
over agriculture injected further uncertainty into delicately poised
multilateral negotiations to liberalize world trade under GATT.

A Canadian official raised the problem of GATT's long-term future, according to
Knight-Ridder Financial News. Canada's trade minister, John Crosbie, urged that
GATT be supplanted soon by a broader global agreement, regardless of the outcome
of the Uruguay Round.

He said he hoped a statement of support for negotiations to begin a new
organization would result from the OECD meeting.

Mr. Crosbie claimed support from the United States, the EC and Japan, according
to the KRF report from Paris. But U.S. and EC diplomats have not voiced any
support to the idea of a new organization since that would concede failure of
the Uruguay round.

The United States wanted this week's ministerial meeting of the OECD to focus on
agricultural subsidies, an issue that has threatened to scuttle the current
Uruguay Round of GATT.

The EC, whose 12 member states account for half the OECD membership of 24
leading industrial countries, reacted angrily to Washington's bid to elevate a
normally relaxed OECD meeting to a hands-on negotiating forum.

Before the meeting began, Richard Crowder, the U.S. agriculture undersecretary,
said the United States and the EC might not be able to agree on a common
statement on agriculture at the close of the OECD meeting. "We could end up with
separate communiques," he said.

In that event, both sides would save face.

The EC was satisfied that the communique will commit OECD members to refrain
from unilateral settlements of trade disputes. The EC has long berated
Washington for seeking to resolve its trade disputes outside GATT and has kept
up a constant attack against the controversial Super 301 provision of the 1988
U.S. Trade Act.

The U.S. position was buoyed in that the communique will refer to the
differences in agriculture policy. Carla A. Hills, the U.S. Trade
Representative, said Wednesday that "The United States has stood by its position
(on agriculture)."

Reaction was heated.

Trading nations should clarify their positions only in the formal Uruguay Round
negotiations in Geneva in late July, Mr. Andriessen said. Moreover, several farm
exporting nations were not represented at the OECD meeting, he added.

Washington's hard-line approach, signaled last week by President Bush when he
warned that the United States would reject an unsatisfactory Uruguay Round
accord, was re-emphasized here by Mrs. Hills.

She said the OECD must focus its efforts on three issues that are threatening
the success of the Uruguay Round: agriculture, subsidies, and the developing
countries' integration into the GATT regime.

To achieve fundamental reform in agriculture, Mrs. Hills said, GATT must have in
place by July a framework for achieving substantial progressive reduction in
each of the areas of negotiation - market access, internal supports and export
subsidies.

"After July, the hard bargaining must begin over how far and how fast reduction
in each area are to be achieved," Mrs. Hills said. "The result should be
translated into finding country programs that yield quantifiable market
liberalization."

The Uruguay round of negotiations under GATT, a Geneva-based body that sets the
rules for some 90 percent of world trade, is scheduled to be completed in
December.

Helmut Haussmann, West Germany's economics minister, said the United States
should not ask the EC to abandon all its agricultural subsidies. He contended
that the community's farm policy serves important regional, social and
environmental purposes.

"The United States must retreat from its position," he said.

However, Mr. Haussmann commented that if Washington dropped its demand for the
complete abolition of subsidies, the EC would agree to a substantial cut in
supports so long as it retained the right to distribute the remaining handouts
as it chose.

The United States sought to build on that support by portraying the EC as the
major obstacle to resolving the agriculture dispute.

"In addition to getting governments off the farm, we want to sweep them out of
the world's steel mills, shipyards and factories," Mrs. Hills said.

Japan rejects U.S. plea   to liberalize rice policy

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 227 words

DATELINE: Tokyo JAPAN


Reuter News Agency
  TOKYO
 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's request for an end to a
Japanese ban on rice imports has been rejected, a Japanese Agriculture
Ministry official says.

"I would like Japan to understand the U.S. concerns on rice trade," the
official quoted Mr. Yeutter as telling Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto
yesterday.

Liberalization of rice imports would spell death for Japanese
agriculture, the official quoted Mr. Yamamoto as saying. He asked for
understanding of Japan's position, the official told reporters.

Tokyo has firmly resisted mounting pressure at home and overseas,
especially from Washington, to end a ban on commercial rice imports saying
it must have self-sufficiency in its national staple.

Mr. Yeutter was quoted as saying the United States wants freer two-way
trade in farm goods to help narrow their big trade imbalance.

Japan's trade surplus with the United States totalled about $49-billion
(U.S.) last year.

Mr. Yeutter was also quoted as urging an overhaul of Japan's food
control system, which inflates the prices of rice, wheat and barley to
several times international levels.

In the one-hour meeting, Mr. Yeutter also emphasized the importance of
a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade, scheduled for the end of
this year, the official said.

EEC, U.S.   to discuss   farm prices

BYLINE: DJ

DATELINE: Brussels BELGIUM


BRUSSELS  (DJ) - The European Economic Community and the United States
 will open a round of special farm trade talks in January, U.S. Agriculture
 Secretary John Block says.

Mr. Block, who was part of a U.S. ministerial delegation that met five
 EEC commissioners, said an agriculture war between Europe and the United
 States would not take place.

But he urged the EEC to narrow the gap between its farm prices and
 world market prices to eliminate export subsidies.

Mr. Block said the United States had not withdrawn its threat to dump
 dairy products on world markets as a retaliation against the subsidies.

He told a news conference "there will be no agriculture trade war." He  said:
"It was agreed that we sit down and look at what can be done."

HIGHLIGHT: genetically engineered


The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA), has approved a genetically engineered (GE)
strain of rice, called LLRICE601 .The investigation into the safety of this rice
began in July, when Bayer CropScience, Monheim am Rhein, Germany, notified the
USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, that they had found trace
amounts of it in commercial long-grain rice. Although the circumstances
surrounding how the genetically engineered rice ended up in the commercial
product is still under investigation, the government says LLRICE601 poses no
safety concerns and no recall or destruction of the long-grain rice is planned.

'U.S. letter complicates row'

SOURCE: Yomiuri

SECTION: Pg. 8

LENGTH: 376 words


Vice Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mamoru Ishihara said Monday a
recent proposal by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman over the possible
resumption of Japanese imports of U.S. beef had made the negotiation more
difficult to settle.

"I feel that because of Veneman's letter, we've lost the possibility of settling
(the Japan-U.S. talks over the issue)," he said at a press conference,
indicating the bilateral talks may be prolonged.

In the United States, small and midsize meatpacking companies demanded that the
U.S. Agriculture Department endorse results of their voluntary blanket tests on
cattle to detect bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.

Japan might have resumed imports of U.S. beef by the end of April if the
Agriculture Department had accredited the blanket tests.

Analysts said Ishihara's remark indicated deep disappointment with the letter in
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry.

The ministry believes imports of U.S. beef would have resumed if U.S.
meatpacking companies conducted voluntary blanket tests and the Agriculture
Department accredited the results.

In the ministry's view, Veneman's response meant that the request for voluntary
blanket tests--which a ministry official said was "the only practical measure
for early resumption of import"--was rejected.

Given the ministry's reaction to the U.S. proposal, the prospect of quickly
resuming imports of U.S. beef is not good, analysts said.

At Monday's press conference, Ishihara demonstrated some sympathy for the United
States' position. "Japan as well as the United States wants to settle this
problem as soon as possible," he said.

Nevertheless, the ministry has rejected an easy compromise, saying the problem
"affects the safety and peace of mind of the people concerning food."

Concerning the disagreement between the Foreign Ministry and the agriculture
ministry over how to respond to the letter, some ministry officials said the
discord had actually functioned to harmonize opinions inside the government.

As it is clear that the two countries will not reach a compromise over the test
issue, it has become less certain when the resumption of U.S. beef imports will
be possible, analysts said.

THE United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently announced that it
had added Britain to a list of regions considered free of Foot- and-Mouth
disease (FMD). The change in disease status covers England, Scotland, Wales, and
the Isle of Man.

USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced the decision
in a report that describes which British products and by-products are now
allowed in the United States and which are still prohibited.

The report said: "The U. S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is
amending its import regulations by adding Great Britain (England, Scotland,
Wales and the Isle of Man) to the list of regions considered to be free of Foot
-and-Mouth disease, which includes North America, Central America, Japan,
Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe.

" In addition, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is adding Great
Britain to the list of regions subject to certain import restrictions on meat
and animal products because of their proximity to or trading relationships with
rinderpest or FMD-af fected regions.

" This rule relieves certain FMD-related prohibitions and restrictions on the
importation of ruminants and swine and fresh (chilled or frozen) meat and other
products of ruminants and swine into the United States from Great Britain. APHIS
will continue to prohibit importation of live ruminants from Great Britain due
to the known presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in that country.

"Other products derived from ruminants, such as fetal bovine serum, bonemeal,
meat-and-bone meal, bloodmeal, offal, fats, and glands, are also prohibited from
entry, except under special conditions or under USDA permit for scientific or
research purposes.

" This final rule follows an interim rule that removed Great Britain and
Northern Ireland effective Feb. 21, 2001, from those lists due to detection of
FMD in those regions. Based on the results of an evaluation of the current FMD
situation in Great Britain, which took into account, among other things, that
Great Britain has met the standards of the Office International des Epizooties
for being considered to be free of FMD, APHIS has determined that Great Britain
can be added to the list of regions considered free of FMD"

Court Says Meat Inspections Are Tainted
Salmonella Can't Close Down a Plant



BYLINE:
BY DAVID RUBENSTEIN

SECTION: CIRCUIT-BY-CIRCUIT; Pg. 86

LENGTH: 1364 words

THE CURRENT U.S. Supreme Court, with its record of overruling federal law and
regulation, is an activist body with a conservative agenda, according to
critics. Justice Antonin Scalia defends the record by saying the Court is merely
reacting to legislators who have overreached and to federal agencies that have
been "pushing the administrative envelope."

A recent ruling by a federal district judge in Texas suggests that Justice
Scalia's view is a significant factor in the lower courts, too. In a ruling that
has appalled some consumer groups, a federal judge has determined that the USDA
exceeded its authority when it shut down a Texas meat-processing plant after
finding salmonella on samples of meat.

The defendant and meat-industry trade groups, while cheered by the ruling, found
a knotty public relations problem arose as the legal problem appeared to recede.
How do you explain to Joe Six Pack that a little salmonella is no big deal, or
that regulators are unfair because chicken processors can get away with more
salmonella than beef processors can?

"I think this case has been misinterpreted," says Philip C. Olsson, a senior
principal at Olsson, Frank & Weeda, Washington, D.C. Olsson acts as general
counsel of the National Meat Association, a trade group that supported plaintiff
Supreme Beef Processors Inc. in the lawsuit it filed against the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.

"A lot of people say this undercuts USDA authority to use microbiological
tests," Olsson says. "On the contrary, it clarifies that USDA has that
authority, where those tests are rationally related to the responsibility of
whoever it is regulating."

NEW RULES IN 1996

The controversy in the case-Supreme Beef Processors Inc. v. United States
Department of Agriculture-is over a salmonella test the USDA uses to determine
whether a meat processing plant is sanitary. The plaintiff argued that the
salmonella test is not valid under the Federal Meat Inspection Act.

Attorneys from both the Justice Department and the USDA participated in this
case. A DOJ spokesman said the department would not comment on the litigation,
except to corroborate reports that an appeal was under consideration. A call to
the USDA's Office of the General Counsel was not returned.

The attorney for plaintiff Supreme Beef Processors, John A. Gilliam, a
shareholder at Jenkens & Gilchrist in Dallas, explains his client's position.
"In 1994," he says, "the USDA, through its sponsors in Congress, attempted to
pass a law that would have given it congressional authority to use
microbiological testing as part of its regulatory procedures.

"It did not pass. So in 1996, without going back to Congress, the USDA
promulgated regulations that contain their salmonella performance standards."

The 1996 final rule outlined something called the HACCP, or "Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point" process. HACCP required meat processors to implement
controls at key process points and to submit to periodic sampling of the product
in order to ascertain whether the preventive controls were working.

The sampling was in the form of a salmonella test. That was a departure from the
old method of "sniff-and-poke" testing, where the inspector uses sight, smell
and touch to identify bad meat.

The USDA maintains that sniff-and-poke testing may have been good enough when
the main threat to the integrity of meat was diseased animals, but that it is
unlikely to uncover pathogenic bacteria that are today's big public health
threat from meat.

SALMONELLA AS INDICATOR

According to the USDA, salmonella is an "indicator" pathogen: Its presence is
evidence that other pathogens are present as well. But according to the meat
industry, there are fatal flaws in that logic.

First, according to the industry, salmonella is a questionable indicator,
because salmonella is common, difficult to eradicate and, although a pathogen,
not among the most dangerous. "Salmonella is a naturally occurring substance in
meat, as it is in other food products, including vegetables and eggs," according
to Gilliam. "Salmonella is not an adulterate like E. coli."

Moreover, the USDA's salmonella-based performance standards are arbitrary and
unfair to the beef industry, according to Gilliam. Poultry plants can have a
significantly higher number of positives and still pass. For ground pork, there
are no standards at all.

"So," he says, "meat that has salmonella in it is being inspected and approved
every day. It's a higher percentage in poultry, and a much higher percentage in
sausage, I would imagine."

Gilliam notes that when salmonella is found at a plant, it does not trigger a
recall. "The way you guard yourself as a consumer against salmonella is by
cooking," he says. "If you cook your meat, you don't have a problem, even if it
has salmonella in it."

But Gilliam's main contention-and the point that swayed the judge-is that the
presence of salmonella is not evidence of an unsanitary plant.

"We showed through testimony during the preliminary injunction hearing that it
was highly probable that the product had salmonella in it even before we got it.

"The salmonella performance standards," he says, "address only the end product.
And that's beyond the scope of the Act."

In its court filings, the USDA says that salmonella is far from harmless,
causing 1.4 million illnesses and 600 deaths a year. More central to the case,
the USDA argues that its testing of product for salmonella does address the
condition of the plant, because controlling "incoming raw product" is part of
what goes into running a sanitary plant. Without proper controls, the plant will
inevitably be contaminated with salmonella.

the JUDGE AGREES with plaintiff

Judge A. Joe Fish, U.S. District judge for the Northern District of Texas,
didn't buy it.

"While the Court agrees that such controls are important, the issue here is not
whether controls on meat entering a plant are important but whether the lack of
such controls can be part of the evaluation, under [the Federal Meat Inspection
Act]
601 (m)(4), of sanitary conditions in the plant."

Judge Fish concludes they can't, for several reasons.

He notes that beef at slaughtering plants has to be inspected and passed by the
USDA before it can be sold to a grinder.

"USDA testing at these other stages of meat processing would be unnecessary if
grinders were required to reject meat contaminated with salmonella coming into
their plants," he reasons.

In this case, according to the Judge Fish, "[B]ecause the USDA's performance
standards and salmonella tests do not necessarily evaluate the conditions of a
meat processor's establishment, they cannot serve as the basis for finding a
plant's meat adulterated under
601 (m)(4). Under that statute, a processor's meat is considered adulterated
only when the USDA finds the conditions of the processor's establishment to be
unsanitary.

"The USDA's salmonella tests, however, inspect a processor's end product to
determine whether its plant's conditions are sanitary. The flaw in such tests is
that the presence of salmonella is not solely-or even substantially-dependent
upon the sanitation in a grinder's establishment. Indeed, a plant could, in
theory, be completely sanitized from top to bottom, but if the meat in it tests
positive for salmonella, the USDA could withdraw its inspectors, effectively
closing a plant that is sanitary."

This case, Judge Fish notes, was a case of first impression not only in the 5th
Circuit, but nationwide.

He also notes that his opinion is not meant to reject "scientific" as opposed to
sniff-and-poke testing. He says he is not taking issue with scientific methods
in USDA inspections, he writes, but rather "the agency's science-based testing
of a processor's product to evaluate the conditions of its plant."

Judge Fish allows that scientific testing under the Federal Meat Inspection Act
could be used to inspect the product itself, as opposed to the plant, but not
under the specific sub-section of the FMIA that the USDA used in this case.

WASHINGTON (AP) Ä A Canadian trade negotiator held out hopes Tuesday that a
settlement could be reached with the United States in a dispute over trade in
wheat and other farm goods. ""I think the time has come to see whether we can't
find a mutually agreed upon way of putting this behind us and move on to other
things,'' said John Weekes, Canada's senior assistant deputy minister for
Canada-U.S. relations. Weekes spoke after a daylong meeting with officials from
the U.S. Agriculture Department and the U.S. trade representative.

Weekes was returning to Ottawa but said he would be in telephone contact with
U.S. officials Wednesday about future meetings. The two countries are trying to
resolve a dispute over the amount of Canadian wheat entering the United States.
The United States blames Canadian rail subsidies and unfair pricing by the
Canadian Wheat Board. The two countries also disagree on access of U.S. dairy
and poultry products to Canada, and Canada's exports of sugar and peanut
products to the United States. Despite the hopeful talks, Tuesday's meeting was
not intended to reach any breakthroughs. ""Today was basically reviewing what's
happened and considering various options for how we might approach the matter,''
he said. He called the meeting a ""continuation'' of the discussion that had
taken place March 21 between U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and Canadian
Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale. ""We did mainly stock-taking today,'' said
Charles J. O'Mara, the chief trade negotiator for the U.S. Agriculture
Department. ""We went through the full collection of issues and all the
alternatives that are available.''Neither side would discuss the status of
threats of trade action, such as U.S. threats of quotas on Canadian wheat if no
agreement is reached by April 22. Espy and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor will be meeting with their Canadian counterparts during a meeting of
ministers under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakech,
Morocco, next week. The newest GATT agreement will be signed there April 15.

Analysts wonder at size of 'phantom' cattle herd

BYLINE: Farm Market News

SECTION: SECTION 3, INVESTOR'S GUIDE; Pg. 28, FARM COMMODITIES

LENGTH: 533 words

DATELINE: Winnipeg,Man.


  The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a cattle inventory report this
past Wednesday that shocked livestock analysts, but should cause meat packers
and consumers to breathe a sigh of relief.

The report said the U.S. cattle inventory as of Jan. 1, 1989, was 99,484,000
head - nearly as large as last year's inventory and well above the figure that
traders had expected. Some traders described the report as ''unbelievable''.

Analysts felt that high 1988 livestock slaughter levels would force the USDA to
reduce its cattle inventory numbers. But the net slaughter in 1988 was estimated
at three million head - unchanged from 1987 - dropping the inventory from 102
million to 99 million.


''Total cattle kill relative to the starting inventory was too high for this,''
says Chuck Levitt, senior analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.

Analysts also believe the Midwest drought in the summer of 1988 should have
stopped any attempts to rebuild the cattle herd. And high feed-grain costs,
along with poor pasture conditions, should have deterred farmers from any
attempts to rebuild, they say.

Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc., predicts the report
will be particularly ''bearish for feeder cattle futures and third-quarter live
cattle futures.''

He says the report ''implies that we have a huge number of steers to put on feed
during the second half of the year, and this will change attitudes and depress
demand for replacement cattle.''

Prior to the report, most analysts estimated cattle prices at the packers, and
beef prices at the supermarket, would rise to record levels in the April-June
period this year as result of the smallest U.S. cattle herd since 1961.

But the USDA report has dampened the bullish feeling. Levitt says: ''It appears
there is a phantom herd out there. The number was larger than anyone could have
possible pieced together using statistical data.''

Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., predicts that packers and
consumers will benefit from this report because of the increased number of
cattle expected to come to market in late 1989 and early 1990.

Morgan says that consumer demand for beef, low cattle weight due to winter
weather, or the upcoming USDA cattle-on-feed report could re-ignite the bull
market.

Morgan notes the ''report implies the beginning of moderate herd expansion.'' He
also suggests that analysts were surprised because they were working off false
data from last year.

The USDA revised the July 1 total inventory up 600,000 head in this report.

The report caused many analysts to question the accuracy of USDA numbers. If
this report is not wrong, they say, then earlier reports were inaccurate. They
note that this was the second report in a month to alter production numbers
radically.

On Jan. 13, the USDA released a corn supply/demand report that said total U.S.
corn supplies were up by almost 600 million bushels. The USDA ''found'' more
corn in storage than its earlier reports stated, and increased the final 1988
corn production figure by 265 million bushels.

This amount of corn is equal to the entire Canadian barley crop of 1988.

The European Economic Community's executive commission invited the United States
today to defuse a trade dispute over the accession of Spain and Portugal to the
community through negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the world trade body.

A spokesman said a letter had been sent to the United States trade
representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, and the Agriculture Secretary-designate,
Richard E. Lyng, proposing the cooling-off move.

Mr. Yeutter has said the

United States would lose valuable farm product exports to the two countries
because they are now subject to the European Economic Community's Common
Agricultural Policy.

He has threatened retaliatory action unless the community finds a satisfactory
solution to the problem.

The spokesman said the letter, from External Relations Commissioner Willy de
Clercq, and Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen, proposed negotiations
with the United States alongside the multilateral talks that have already begun
with the community's major trading partners on the enlargement of the community.

However, commission sources said it appeared that the United States might not
accept the suggestion since it had been demanding immediate compensation for the
damage done to its trade by the accession of Spain and Portugal.

REAGAN CALLS FOR 'NO HOLDS BARRED' EXAMINATION OF HUNGER REPORTS

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2


President Reagan said today that he was perplexed at reports of people going
hungry in the United States despite Federal programs to help them and he
directed a group of experts to examine the reported increasing hunger.

''I want the task force to bring me a no-holds-barred study,'' Mr. Reagan said
in a memorandum creating the new group. ''If the food assistance programs are
being mismanaged, I want to know that. If certain aspects of our food assistance
programs require more funding, I want to know that, too.''

At the same time, the Administration confirmed that the Department of
Agriculture would resume and increase distribution of free cheese and other
commodities to the poor. The cheese distribution was cut back last month because
it adversely affected sales in the commercial market.

David Lane, deputy press secretary at the Agriculture Department, said many
details had to be worked out, but there would be increases soon in the
distribution of cheese, butter, nonfat dry milk, corn meal and honey. In
addition, he said these commodities were to be released in bulk to states for
separate processing and distribution.

Reports of Hunger Cited Mr. Lane said Agriculture Secretary John R. Block had
decided on ''a little bit more'' in distributing food because of recent reports
of rising hunger. As for industry complaints that distribution was causing sales
to drop, Mr. Lane said: ''At this point, we are ignoring that factor.''

The Administration's actions came in response to complaints from mayors and
nutrition groups that hunger is rising because of the recession and because of
the Administration's cutbacks in food stamps, child nutrition and other
programs.

Few of Mr. Reagan's domestic programs have caused as much debate in Congress as
the deep cuts in these areas. Federal spending on food stamps declined last year
for the first time since 1969, according to the General Accounting Office. The
cuts have come in the form of ending the eligibility of some people and delaying
increases in benefits for others.

Last week the President signed legislation that included $1.2 billion to finance
the existing reduced food stamp program for the remaining two months of this
fiscal year.

For the next fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1, the Administration is seeking to
merge school breakfast, summer lunch and child-care food programs into a block
grant and to reduce the total amount spent.

With the rise in complaints about hunger, Congress appears less likely to go
along. Today, the House of Representatives approved a resolution by a vote of
408 to 15 declaring that there should be no further cuts in any food program
benefits this year.

Hunger Strikers End Fast

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 2 (AP) - About 20 people who have fasted since July 4 in
an effort to get the Federal Government to release some of its surplus food
ended their fast today because Mr. Block said more food would be distributed.
''We accomplished what we set out to do,'' said Mitch Snyder of the
Washington-based Community for Creative Non-Violence.

U.S. wheat subsidies ruin export market board official says

BYLINE: (CP)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 455 words

DATELINE: REGINA, Saskatchewan


   REGINA (CP) - A commissioner with the Canadian Wheat Board has lashed out at
United States export subsidy programs for pinning down grain prices that he says
would otherwise be floating upward.

Bill Smith told delegates at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool annual meeting Friday
the U.S. is wasting billions of dollars to muscle its way back into markets it
priced itself out of in the early 1980s.

Despite the bullying of the United States, the Canadian Wheat Board, which
markets Canadian farmers' grain, won't back down, Smith said.

Seven years

"Our frustration is the only satisfaction the United States Department of
Agriculture is going to get from spending all this money," he said. "We are not
going to be driven out of any markets and our exports last year and so far this
year underline our determination."

U.S. President Reagan's export subsidy program, called the Export Enhancement
Program, has resulted in a "buy two, get one free" windfall for importers, Smith
said.

The program is galling because for the first time in seven years world
production is less than consumption. And since many producers around the world
have harvested a below-normal quality crop, stocks of high-quality milling wheat
are expected to be tight.

The price should move up, but when the U.S. increases its subsidy and sells some
of its stockpile, the Europeans follow suit and the price remains low.

"The (subsidy) program has been foolish from Day One, but it has reached the
point of being stupid," Smith said.

The subsidies were offered first to poor countries, but have expanded to almost
the entire world. Now even Saudi Arabia and Switzerland are benefiting.

Turning to board sales this year, Smith said exports are well above last year
which was the best on record.

The board is particularly happy with the price of oats. U.S. demand for
high-quality oats is greater than production and in the past the shortfall was
made up by Swedish and Finnish imports.

But a poor-quality American and Scandanavian crop has given high-quality oats a
substantial premium.

While a return to good-quality crops in the U.S. or Scandinavia could make
things more competitive next year, the Canadian product has at least gained a
foothold in the American market.

Rail system

However, Smith said the board is frustrated over the inability of the rail
system to supply Thunder Bay with enough grain to meet export contracts.

"All we can say is that we had hoped things would have come a little farther by
now," he said. "The board and the trade are pushing the system to the limit and
that is when the most problems will show up.

"I want to emphasize that we are not pushing any harder now than in the past."

US, Pakistan anti wheat diseases initiatives to improve rural economy

BYLINE:  Tariq Khattak

SECTION: Vol. XXIV No. 188

LENGTH: 519  words


U.S. Ambassador Richard Olson today reaffirmed the United States government's
long-term support to farming communities in Pakistan. "Since the 1950s, the
United States has been working to support agriculture in Pakistan, introducing
the Kinnow orange and helping to double Pakistan's wheat production. Today, we
continue our support because improving crop yields, protecting food sources from
disease, and boosting milk production will increase farmers' incomes, improve
nutrition, and ultimately strengthen Pakistan's prosperity."

Addressing a gathering of government officials, researchers, and farmers during
his visit to the National Agriculture Research Center (NARC), which was
established with the help of the U.S. government in the 1980s, Ambassador Olson
said, "The United States is committed to helping the small farmers of Pakistan
through projects that enhance agricultural productivity." The Ambassador lauded
the progress made by the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project (WPEP), a United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) program managed in collaboration with
national and provincial research partners that has successfully introduced the
UG 99-resistant wheat variety, "NARC 2011."

The introduction of this wheat variety helps protect Pakistan against UG 99, a
virulent wheat disease in the region that poses a threat to Pakistan's farming
community. "Wheat accounts for approximately 60 percent of the daily caloric
intake of the average Pakistani, so our joint efforts to combat this disease are
critical," said Ambassador Olson. "The Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project
team and Pakistani scientists at national and provincial research stations have
made great progress in the fight against wheat rusts, and I encourage you to
continue your work together."

In addition to support for the Wheat Productivity Enhancement Project, the
United States has provided new harvesting machines and funded improvements to
research stations around Pakistan to develop more disease-resistant wheat
varieties. The United States also provides specialized training opportunities to
Pakistani wheat scientists.

Dr. Muhammad Imtiaz, Country Liaison Officer for the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center, noted that without disease-resistant varieties of
wheat, such as the one being harvested at NARC, experts estimate that Pakistan's
annual wheat harvest could be reduced by as much as 50 percent if and when UG 99
arrives.

"Agriculture contributes 21 percent to the GDP of Pakistan and employs 45
percent of the labor force, making it one of the most significant economic
drivers of Pakistan," Dr. Imtiaz said. Pakistani farmers grew about 24 million
tons of wheat on eight million hectares last year, accounting for about 2.4
percent of the GDP.

"The United States and Pakistan have similar agricultural systems, and for that
reason we have been effective partners in agriculture for more than half a
century, working together to improve agricultural yields and to combat disease,"
said Ambassador Olson. "Since the 1950s, U.S. and Pakistani scientists have
collaborated to increase wheat production.

U.S. soybean sales to China rise by 40%

BYLINE: JOHN EVERLY

SECTION: Business; Pg. b2

LENGTH: 197 words


Brazil, the United States' chief competitor for world soybean markets, is
expected to export more than 26 million tons of soybeans this year, up from 21
million tons last year.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States expects to
export 24.5 million tons of soybeans, down 4 million tons from last year.

But Iowa State University economist Robert Wisner notes this year's sales have
been brisk, already at 91 percent of the department's 2003-2004 projections.

Fortunately for American growers, major soybean importer China seems to prefer
American soybeans. U.S. soybean sales to China are booming, up more than 40
percent from a year ago.

"The big question mark is Asian rust - will that come on strong?" Wisner said.

The disease has been found in Brazil and it could be a number of years before
researchers find rust-resistant soybean strains.

Brazil still threatens to eclipse the United States in soybean production.
Wisner points out Brazil still has a huge amount of land that could be developed
for crop production. Untapped acreage in Brazil is at least as large as the U.S.
corn, wheat, soybean and cotton acreage combined.

Raising Farm Subsidies, U.S. Widens International Rift

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; Foreign Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1092 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14


Less than one month after President Bush signed the new farm bill, agriculture
has leaped from the backwaters of diplomacy to near the top of the list of
international complaints against the United States.

Portrayed by its supporters as a necessary safety net for farmers and by its
detractors as an election-year welfare program to win Midwestern votes, the huge
increase in subsidies has become an overnight magnet for America-bashing.

Javier Solana, Europe's foreign policy chief, declared in Madrid this week that
the new American agriculture policy has created the "most profound" division
between Europe and the United States, worse than disputes over steel tariffs,
the Kyoto environmental treaty or the international criminal court.

In Washington, in an address to Congress, Prime Minister John Howard of
Australia said on Wednesday that the only problem between these closest of
friends was his country's "intense disappointment" over the $180 billion farm
bill.

In Rome, at a United Nations conference on hunger, developing countries pointed
this week to the huge new subsidies to American farmers as one of the biggest
obstacles to creating vital opportunities for their own farmers and enabling
them to climb out of poverty.

With Mr. Bush pressing other countries to knock down their trade barriers and
expand open markets, his approval of an 80 percent increase in farm subsidies --
with all the advantages that confers on American grain exports -- is viewed as a
move in the opposite direction.

Poor countries say the subsidies also work at cross purposes to the
administration's avowed desire to reduce poverty and to diminish foreign anger
against the United States.

In a private letter to Congressional leaders, a group of countries known as the
Cairns Group, which includes Australia, Thailand, Canada, Brazil and Argentina,
wrote this month that "the sheer size of the subsidy package will inevitably
hurt farmers around the world, particularly in developing countries."

"The United States should be sending a very different message," wrote Mark
Vaile, the group's chairman.

The heart of the dispute is that by underwriting its largest farmers, the United
States is flooding the world market with inexpensive corn, wheat, rice and
soybeans, which are sold at half what it costs to produce the grain. That leads
to artificially low world prices, which in turn undercut grain produced by
farmers in countries that do not give subsidies. The grain market becomes
distorted, domestic markets are ruined for producers overseas and their chances
of making inroads into foreign markets are reduced.

"Subsidies and other measures applied by the world's richest countries continue
to increase exponentially," said Navin Chandarpal, Guyana's minister of
agriculture, at the Rome conference. "We continue to be pressured into further
opening up our markets, without any regard being paid to the welfare of our
farming and rural communities as a whole."

Development experts agree and say the effects ripple throughout developing
economies. "American farm exports drive down prices paid to local farmers,
reduce rural family income around the world and push farmers off the land and
into overcrowded cities," said Mark Ritchie, president of the Institute for
Agriculture Trade Policy, a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis.

However, some developing countries with sufficient foreign reserves prefer to
import cheap American food as they build up other sectors of their economy.

Despite the complaints, the new American farm policy also conforms to the
current rules of the World Trade Organization. Indeed, the United States is not
alone as a wealthy country that gives generous welfare programs to farmers. The
15-nation European Union is notorious for giving lavish subsidies to its seven
million farmers.

In an address in Germany this month, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade
representative, defended the farm bill and suggested "respectfully that
America-bashing will not promote the E.U.'s enlightened self-interest.

"When Europeans criticize the recent U.S. farm bill, I wonder how many are even
aware that U.S. agricultural tariffs are less than half of the E.U.'s," he said.

Disputes between the world's major economies -- United States, Europe and Japan
-- over farm subsidies are nothing new. But the latest American increase,
European Union officials say, comes as they are trying to reduce their own
payments.

With plans to admit 10 new countries -- including Poland, where nearly one-third
of 40 million inhabitants identify themselves as full- or part-time farmers --
the European Union says it must slash expensive programs to support agricultural
production and give more money for conservation and rural development.

Critics of the new American policy say that, by giving in to the domestic farm
vote, the United States will have a difficult time persuading other countries to
open their markets to American agricultural products.

"The American farmers have shot themselves in the foot," said C. Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics. "The long term growth of
U.S. agriculture is clearly in foreign markets, particularly the rapidly growing
emerging markets. That requires liberalization and access to those markets. The
farm bill undercuts our ability to reach those markets."

During the debate on the farm bill, lawmakers in Congress painted a different
picture, arguing that American farmers needed subsidies to remain competitive in
the world.

America's main competitors on the global grain markets are not the European
Union countries but countries that pay few or no subsidies to farmers and indeed
may even tax food exports to earn more government revenue.

During the trade negotiations at Qatar six months ago, members of the World
Trade Organization agreed to remove barriers to farm trade.

Mr. Zoellick insists that the United States remains committed to the goals
worked out in Qatar. But both the Bush administration and the European Union --
whose dispute over farming is essentially one of their many trade battles over
state subsidies -- will be hard pressed to remove the barriers to foreign
agricultural products without upsetting their powerful farmers.

"We're all free traders and we're all hypocrites," said Peter L. Scher,
specialist on trade negotiations for agriculture in the Clinton administration.
"I blame the Europeans as well as the Americans. If we're going to develop these
poor countries, we've got to give these nations a chance to develop their own
agricultures."

County's ag record is lauded;
Lancaster farmland a model for success

BYLINE: Larry Alexander, Intelligencer Journal Staff

SECTION: B; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 484  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


Lancaster County is a national role model in farmland preservation and a leader
in agriculture.

That lofty praise was delivered to more than 150 county residents and civic
leaders by Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff on
Tuesday, during an address sponsored by Lancaster County Planning Commission.

Wolff spoke in the renovated 1855 barn at Country Barn Farm Market, 211 S.
Donnerville Road.

He said Lancaster County's billion-dollar-a-year ag industry is bigger than the
ag economy in some states.

"The agriculture economy in this county is just something that most other
secretaries of agriculture, at least in the eastern part of the United States,
find hard to believe," Wolff said.

Lancaster County is blessed with "some of the best topsoil in the world," Wolff
said. The problem is the "continuing battle to keep the topsoil in farming."

That battle is another place where the county shines.

"We recently came to realize that you have the largest farmland preservation
program in the United States," Wolff said. "We knew it was one of the largest
agricultural counties in the nation, but through the great work of the Lancaster
County Farmland Preservation Trust and our state farmland preservation program,
you have now become the county that has made the largest investment and has the
most farms preserved of any county in the United States."

Wolff, who lives in Columbia County but whose roots trace back to Quarryville,
said the county, with its "great farms" and "great lifestyle," is "precious to
each and every one of you, and is certainly worth protecting and preserving."

Wolff praised the Blue Ribbon Commission for Agriculture, sponsored by the
Lancaster County Commissioners, in developing a new strategic plan in regards to
agriculture, which he said was "very, very well done."

Wolff said the county is on the right track in balancing agriculture with the
growth of population and needs for further development.

He said in his home area of Columbia County, officials planned poorly when it
came to subdividing farmland, by requiring that one house be built per two
acres.

"Looking back, it was a poor decision," he said. "When you put one house on two
acres, you're taking two acres of agriculture land out of production."

By leaning toward high density housing and urban growth boundaries, Lancaster
County planners, Wolff said, "keep agriculture at the heart and center of
decisions that they make."

Wolff said farming and development coexist well in Lancaster County, compared to
other parts of the state.

"When you look at how much ag there is here in this county, and you look at how
many people live here, it's done very, very well," he said. "It's something you
should be very proud of and something I think will be critical in terms of
moving ahead in preserving what is truly the wonderful natural resources you've
been given here."

FG, USAID Sign Agreement to De-Risk Lending to Agric Sector

BYLINE: Idris Ahmed

LENGTH: 414 words


Federal government and the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) yesterday signed an agreement to de-risk banks lending to farmers in
Nigeria.

The Minister of Agriculture Dr. Akinwumi Adesina and governor of Central Bank of
Nigeria Sanusi Lamido Sanusi signed the Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of
Nigeria, while the USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah signed for US.

The agreement is under the federal government's Nigeria Incentive Based Risk
Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), which the Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and the Central Bank of Nigeria are championing to enable banks lend
to farmers.

The NIRSAL has N75 billion funding capital.

Yesterday's agreement involved $3 billion that banks are expected to invest in
agriculture overtime and the United States of America has agreed to guarantee
the first $100 million so that farmers can access bank loans without collateral.

"Our specific part of the $3 billion vision is to take the first $100 million
and we will guarantee that the agricultural sector will pay back to banks so
that they can have the courage and conviction to make that loan," Shah said.

He said: "We know that access is very limited and the United State is committed
to working with the central bank and ministry of agric to offer technical
assistance to banks so that hundreds of millions of dollars can be provided at a
lower interest rate to farmers."

The minister of Agriculture said that the facility will reduce the interest rate
that is paid by farmers.

Adesina said: "If for example, the interest rate is 15 percent, because of the
risk sharing facility that NIRSAL will do and because of the fact the ministry
of agriculture is fixing the agric value chain, it means that the interest rate
would go down from 15 percent to about 9 percent. It is a facility that would
reduce the risk of lending and the interest rate paid by farmers.

"We are going to help the farmers to organize themselves into cooperative groups
and the agro dealers that are going to benefit from this facility are going to
be registered. The reason why banks ask for collateral is because if they think
that you are a high risk borrower, they need something they can hold on to. In
this particular case we are linking farmers to companies that are buying from
them. We need new ways of lending that are not based on collateral."

The central bank governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi said banks are now convinced to
start lending to the agricultural sector.

US red meat exports to Asia predicted to rise

BYLINE: BY RICK KNEE

SECTION: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 507 words

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO


Continuing economic woes in Japan will not prevent U.S. sales of red meat from
expanding over the next few years in what is by far the largest U.S. export
market for these products.

Even amid Asia's currency woes, the market in Japan for red meat ""is very
promising,'' said Bruce Cobb, director of development and marketing services for
the U.S. Meat Export Federation, Denver. The group is predicting steady growth
to Japan, despite a lackluster economy and few signs that the government is
committed to large scale economic reform.

The federation expects exports of beef and pork to Japan to reach 500,000 and
180,000 metric tons, respectively, this year; 510,000 and 200,000 tons in 1999;
and 550,000 and 240,000 tons in 2000.

Red meat exports overall to Japan have had a meteoric rise over the last decade,
expanding from just over 200,000 tons in 1987 to 700,000 tons in 1996.  Exports
dipped to just over 600,000 tons in 1997, according to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, because of concern over possible E. coli bacteria contamination.

That experience illustrated the sensitivity of Japanese consumers to food safety
and triggered a major campaign to educate consumers about U.S. food safety
procedures. The campaign appears to be paying off. Japanese consumers also are
focusing more on product value and less on price, with branded products growing
in popularity, Mr. Cobb said.

The meat export group is trying to persuade members to increase exports of
boneless meats as a percentage of their total volume.

U.S. exporters face growing competition from beef producers in Australia and,
more recently, Argentina, and from pork producers in Denmark, Canada and South
Korea, Mr. Cobb said. Exports to South Korea are also expected to grow.
Projected volumes of beef and pork shipments to Korea are 101,000 and 20,000
tons this year, 113,000 and 27,000 tons in 1999, and 124,000 and 39,000 tons in
2000, the export federation said.

Red meat exports to Korea rose from zero in 1987 to 121,000 tons in 1995. They
plummeted to about 91,000 in 1996 and jumped back to about 105,000 in 1997,
according to the USDA. Food safety issues are prone to crop up in Korea the same
way they do in Japan, Mr. Cobb said.

Exporters should not be too discouraged by Korea's currency devaluation, Mr.
Cobb said. In fact, the Meat Export Federation believes the Korean market will
rebound more quickly than the Mexican market did after the peso's plunge a few
years ago, he said.

Moreover, Korea's beef and pork production has dropped steeply, which will allow
U.S. producers to boost their market share, he said.

Also boding well, Mr. Cobb said, are planned steps by the Korean government to
liberalize import policies. They include a drop in the duty for beef from the
current 42.4 percent to 40 percent by 2004; elimination in 2000 of a 20 percent
markup on import beef prices; a decrease in the duty for pork from the current
32.2 percent to 25 percent by 2004; and a liberalization of pork quotas last
July 1.

United States to import Brazilian limes_

SECTION: Agribusiness

LENGTH: 150 words

DATELINE: 08/12/98


Teresina - The United States Agriculture Department (USDA) is expected to
liberate a provisional authorization by the end of 1998 for the creation of
Brazil's first free zone for in natura lime exports to the US. The area chosen
is a region of 30,000 hectares in the municipal districts of Teresina, JosA de
Freitas and Uniao in the state of Piaui, which in 1997 exported 400 tons of
tahiti limes of the 1,500 tons produced in Brazil. The last details for the
creation of the free zone are being defined by Brazil's Agriculture Ministry in
conjuction with the US government, after a process which took two and a half
years in the monitoring of plagues and flies and statistical controls of insect
captures. The technical studies proved that the area chosen is the only one in
Brazil completely free of the Ceratitis fly and of other citric fruit diseases.

BILL HITS PESTICIDE EXPORTS

BYLINE: Bill Lambrecht Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 338 words


WASHINGTON - Proposed free trading with Mexico makes it essential to stop the
''Circle of Poison,'' say sponsors of legislation to clamp down on pesticide
exports.  ''Trade of food and agricultural products is very important, but trade
of safe food ought to be at the heart of our policy,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., at a news conference Tuesday to announce the filing of the bill.  The
legislation would slap new controls on foreign sales of pesticides that are
banned or unregistered in the United States. A similar bill died last year.
Sponsors of the bill call some pesticide exports the ''Circle of Poison''
because banned chemicals often wind up on fruit and vegetables imported into the
United States.  Agriculture Department records show that more than 10 percent of
imported peas have residue of chemicals that can't be used in the United States.
Other imports and the amount of residue include eggplant 9.4 percent,
blackberries 8.9 percent, pears 8.3 percent, and peppers 7.4 percent.
''Breaking the circle of poison means blocking U.S. companies from dumping
chemicals abroad that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found
unsafe,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee and a co-sponsor of the legislation.  Exports of butachlor (sold as
Machete) and acetochlor - products of Monsanto Co. of St. Louis that are not
registered in the United States - would be banned under the legislation. The
bill also would: Require consent from other countries before U.S. companies send
them pesticides that have restrictions in the United States. Allow individuals -
not just government agencies - to file lawsuits to enforce the provisions.  Dan
Holman, a spokesman for Monsanto, said, ''The so-called circle of poison bill
does nothing to help the Food and Drug Administration do its job.'' He argued
that the legislation would damage U.S. chemical companies because they would
lose out in world markets to foreign competitors who sell similar pesticides.

Low Hog Prices Hurt Agricultural Index

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

SECTION: Section C; Page 2; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 203 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31


The lowest hog prices since 1964 helped drag down the December index of prices
received by farmers for their goods, the United States Agriculture Department
said on Wednesday.

Over all, the All Farm Products Index showed that farm prices, reflecting a
seasonal mix of commodities, were down 2 percent from November and down 6.7
percent from December 1997.

Falling prices for cattle, broilers and soybeans also contributed to the
decline, though it was cushioned by a record-high price for milk and higher
prices for corn, tomatoes and eggs.

The hog herd was the biggest since December 1980. As a result, in mid-December
farmers received an average cash price of $14.70 for each hundred pounds, the
lowest since prices fell to $14.30 in November 1964. Prices were off $4 from a
month ago and off $26.90 from a year ago.

The monthly survey showed December cattle prices averaged $55.80 for each 100
pounds, down $2.30 from November and down $7.10 from a year earlier, amid huge
supplies and competition from record pork production.

In the cash markets, corn sold for $1.96 a bushel, up 3 cents from November but
down 56 cents from a year ago because of the second-largest crop ever and weak
export demand.

TAIWAN AT ODDS WITH US OVER BEEF BAN CLAIM

SECTION: 1st Edition; NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 312 words


The government of Taiwan is disputing a United States Department of Agriculture
statement that Taiwan has agreed to resume US beef imports soon, according to
the news agency, Reuters.

In addition, Agriculture Undersecretary for Farm and reportedly Foreign
Agricultural Services, J B Penn, had said in a conference call from Hong Kong
that it was a "pretty correct characterization" that no significant progress had
been made.

A Taiwanese official has also stated that its government had not determined
whether US beef is safe from BSE and would not be sending inspectors to the
United States on November 10 as the USDA had announced earlier this week.

Meanwhile, the Government of Canada has announced that Implementation of the
national 'Repositioning the Livestock Industry Strategy' is fully underway.

The $ 488 million (pounds 218 million) strategy was first announced in September
Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister, Andy Mitchell.

The strategy is aimed at assisting Canada's beef and cattle industry in
repositioning itself to ensure its long-term viability in light of the ongoing
BSE situation.

Quick implementation of many of the strategy's components is indicative of the
high level of co-operation taking place between governments and industry.

"The priority has been to have these programmes in place to allow producers to
benefit from them this fall," said Minister Mitchell.

"While it remains critical to have a reopened US border, the federal government
is committed to returning our beef industry to profitability and these
programmes are a critical part of that commitment."

Stan Eby, president of the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said: "The Canadian
Cattlemen's Association is pleased with the implementation of the repositioning
strategy and the flexibility shown by the Minister to make the programmes work."

Gypsy Moth Spraying: Other Views

SECTION: Section 12NJ; Page 18, Column 2; New Jersey Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 476 words


In response to Pete Dunne's ''In the Natural State'' column, ''In Trying to Kill
the Gypsy Moth, Are We Going Too Far?'':

According to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, the gypsy moth is
expected to cause defoliation of 300,000 acres in New Jersey despite an ongoing
spraying program to save our trees. In addition, the gypsy moth poses a health
hazard, as hundreds of schoolchildren in Hunterdon, Morris and Warren Counties
have reported welts and rashes after the tiny caterpillars are crushed on the
skin when mistaken for gnats. Yet Mr. Dunne says that the gypsy moth is not a
health hazard and that spraying programs should be terminated.

The current method of eliminating the gypsy moth is spraying with Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt). This nonchemical substance has been deemed by the New Jersey
Forest Service, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture and the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection to affect only the gypsy moth and to be
harmless to humans, animals and beneficial insects like honeybees or lady
beetles. This is strikingly dissimilar to the claim that Bt kills inchworms and
butterflies.

Another substance, Sevin, was used effectively to eradicate the gypsy moth in
New Jersey from 1970 to 1985. Although the New Jersey Department of Agriculture
has not used Sevin since 1985, it has been proved safe by the World Health
Organization, the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of
Occupational Health, the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United
States Department of Agriculture and the United States Army.

Sevin has been recently approved for use in controlling deer ticks, which carry
Lyme disease. It is also registered by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency and therefore proved safe for use on over 130 food crops
including tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, potatoes and squash.

We believe that the spraying programs in New Jersey are crucial to protecting
our trees and that spraying programs must use as many safe methods as possible
to eradicate the gypsy moth. At present, only 88,000 acres of recreational and
residential areas in New Jersey are sprayed, leaving more than 1.3 million acres
of open woodlands untreated. Our environment is being threatened.

We join with the thousands of New Jerseyans who hold an opposing viewpoint to
those who advocate protecting the destructive gypsy moth while putting nature's
beauty at risk. Let's insist on more state use of effective control mechanisms
to solve this crisis.

The Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey represents 105 member companies in
the chemical and allied products industry. The New Jersey chemical industry
employs nearly 120,000 workers and produces approximately $18 billion in
shipments.

THE NATION;
REagan Tries His Hand at Farm Politics

BYLINE: By Carlyle Douglas, Michael Wright and Caroline Rand Herron

SECTION: Section 4; Page 2, Column 1; Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 503 words


That more is less for the American farmer is not a matter of aesthetics but
fact. As the United States Department of Agriculture announced last week that
production of corn, wheat and some other major crops hit record highs in 1982,
some farm prices stood at their lowest levels in a decade and net farm income
was at its lowest in 50 years.

While farmers elsewhere in the country put up sometimes violent resistance to
loan-default sales, President Reagan was in Dallas telling members of the
American Farm Bureau Federation that ''help is on the way.'' He said that he
would sign a bill limiting Presidential power to curb foreign grain sales and
that his Administration would go ahead with its ''payment-in-kind'', or PIK,
program despite a lack of Congressional approval.

The measure didn't make it through the lame duck session, but Agriculture
officials believed that they already had ''adequate legislative authority'' to
implement most aspects of the program.  However, that position could be subject
to a challenge by the farmstate legislators who beat back the PIK bill.

The grain sale policy change - export contracts calling for delivery within 270
days of the announcement of an embargo would be allowed to go through - was
welcomed. But questions remained as to just how much help PIK would provide.

Under the program, grain and cotton farmers who receive cash subsidies for
reducing their normal acreage by 20 percent to 25 percent could get an
additional subsidy in the form of stored surplus crops by reducing their
plantings further, up to 50 percent. They would be given up to 95 percent of the
crop that would have been raised on the additional acres taken out of
production.

The farmers could do as they wished with the PIK payments. But the biggest
immediate benefit would be to the Agriculture Department, whose crop storage and
support costs would be reduced by more than $1 billion in fiscal 1984, according
to Agriculture Secretary John R. Block.

The second major aim of PIK, an increase in farm prices in 1984, would depend on
widespread participation in the program. An early estimate by the Pioneer Seed
Company of Des Moines, Iowa suggested that if three-quarters of eligible corn
farmers took the maximum additional 30 percent out of production, the harvest
would still be so big that only a slight reduction in the surplus would result.
Even that might be erased if cash-strapped farmers dumped their PIK corn on the
market. And the already depressed farm supply economy might be battered further
by the ripple effects of new decreases in planting -sales of seed, fertilizer,
and some equipment would surely fall off.

Among wheat farmers PIK's propects are even more clouded. Farmers in Kansas
reported last week that their winter wheat crop looked very good, so they
probably would lose money by participating in PIK. But wheatgrowers in Oklahoma,
hit by bad weather, might gladly plow under their ailing winter crop. The
Government has given them until March 11 to decide.

Grain summit meeting fails to reach solution

SECTION: ROB; Pg. B15

They had many cordial discussions during their three-day meeting in
 Whistler, B.C., and they toured some beautiful scenery. But the only
 concrete result was a promise to meet again.

The grain exporters refused to back down from their earlier stances,
 and two of them threatened to escalate a trade war that has driven
 thousands of farmers around the world to the verge of financial ruin.

The meeting was called by Mr. Mayer to bring some sense to world
 agriculture. The European Community and the United States are trying to
 cut each other out of Third World markets by spending billions of dollars
 on export subsidies.

The only result so far has been to lower the international price of
 food and cut the small exporters - Canada, Australia and Argentina - out
 of their traditional markets.

The EC is usually seen as the villain of world agriculture because it
 is spending an estimated $7.8-billion on wheat subsidies this year alone.
 The United States has responded with subsidies of its own, including wheat
 subsidies that total about $5.7-billion.

Canada spends an estimated $835- million on wheat, and the other
 exporters even less.

The meeting was attended by the five politicians who oversee 90 per
 cent of world grain exports. They are: Richard Lyng, U.S. Secretary of
 Agriculture; Frans Andriessen, Agriculture Commissioner for the EC; John
 Dawkins, Australia's Trade Minister; Lucio Reca, Argentina's Agriculture
 Secretary; and Mr. Mayer.

Instead of settling their differences, as Mr. Mayer hoped, the
 representatives from the United States and the EC assumed an air of
 injured innocence and blamed the opposite party.

"I have said consistently we don't want to have a trade war, but the
 United States is not going to make all the adjustments," Mr. Lyng said.
 "We pointed out that our aim is to regain markets we have lost."

In his rebuttal, Mr. Andriessen contended that the EC is just defending
 its traditional markets and its farmers from U.S. aggression.

"We are simply not prepared to expose our farmers to unlimited world
 market pressures, and to add one million unemployed," he said. "I think we
 can match their monies."

Canada also came under attack because it is growing a record volume of
 wheat this year. The United States said this was irresponsible because it
 would just add to the world grain surplus.

Canada is, however, a small player on the world agricultural scene. The
 states of Iowa, Illinois and California together grow more farm products
 than does Canada.

For Months, Agriculture Department Delayed Announcing Result of Mad Cow Test

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

SECTION: Section 1; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 1580 words


Although the Agriculture Department confirmed Friday that a cow that died last
year was infected with mad cow disease, a test the agency conducted seven months
ago indicated that the animal had the disease. The result was never publicly
disclosed.

The delay in confirming the United States' second case of mad cow disease seems
to underscore what critics of the agency have said for a long time: that there
are serious and systemic problems in the way the Agriculture Department tests
animals for mad cow.

Indeed, the lengthy delay occurred despite the intense national interest in the
disease and the fact that many countries have banned shipments of beef from the
United States because of what they consider to be lax testing policies.

Until Friday, it was not public knowledge that an ''experimental'' test had been
performed last November by an Agriculture Department laboratory on the brain of
a cow suspected of having mad cow disease, and that the test had come up
positive.

For seven months, all that was known was that a test on the same cow done at the
same laboratory at roughly the same time had come up negative. The negative
result was obtained using a test that the Agriculture Department refers to as
its ''gold standard.''

The explanation that the department gave late Friday, when the positive test
result came to light, was that there was no bad intention or cover-up, and that
the test in question was only experimental.

''The laboratory folks just never mentioned it to anyone higher up,'' said Ed
Loyd, an Agriculture Department spokesman. ''They didn't know if it was valid or
not, so they didn't report it.''

On hearing that Friday night, Dr. Michael K. Hansen, a senior research associate
at Consumers Union and frequent department critic, reacted skeptically.

''That seems hard to fathom,'' he said. ''If it's true, we have a serious
communication problem at the Department of Agriculture. How can we be confident
of anything they're saying?''

Mr. Loyd, reacting to a reporter's question about the Agriculture Department's
handling of the issue, said, ''In hindsight, reporting it would have been the
thing to do.''

Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns briefly mentioned the positive test result at
a news conference on Friday. The primary focus of the conference was to announce
that British scientists had confirmed the United States' second case of the
disease.

The sequence of events started in November, when an Agriculture Department
laboratory in Ames, Iowa, performed two tests on the animal in question. After
the ''gold standard'' test came up negative, the agency announced that the
animal had not had mad cow disease. But at the same time, the same lab also
conducted the experimental test, with different results.

Then two weeks ago, for reasons that are unclear, Phyllis K. Fong, the
Agriculture Department's inspector general, arranged for further tests on
specimens of the same cow. A test known as the Western blot, which is widely
used in England and Japan but not in the United States, came up positive.

Because this result conflicted with the ''gold standard'' result from November,
a specimen from the same animal was sent to a laboratory in Weybridge, England,
that is considered pre-eminent in its field. Several tests were conducted there,
and all of them came up positive; it was the results of those tests that Mr.
Johanns announced at the news conference on Friday afternoon.

The nation's mad cow testing system is now infuriating both ranchers and
consumers. Consumer lobbyists say the flawed results show once again that 15
years of testing has been dangerously inadequate. And now the beef lobby, which
has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the Agriculture Department, is
complaining that the testing system is dangerously unpredictable.

Jim McAdams, president of the 25,000-member National Cattlemen's Beef
Association, has complained that unexpected testing creates ''great anxiety
within our industry,'' and leads to ''significant losses.''

Thirty-six countries have shut their doors to American beef, virtually wiping
out a $3 billion export market, which Australia happily moved into.

On Saturday, Taiwan reimposed a ban on American beef that it had lifted just two
months ago, Reuters reported.

The new case of mad cow appeared to be in a native-born animal, though Mr.
Johanns was vague about that. Testing also suggested that the animal caught the
disease from a new food source, since the strain was different from that of the
Washington State cow that tested positive in 2003.

Mr. Johanns said that catching one positive in 388,000 recent tests proved the
system worked.

But critics said it did no such thing, because the system was designed strictly
for surveillance. One positive caught after a seven-month delay was, at best, a
stroke of luck, the critics said.

Other countries use food-safety standards: Japan tests every cow, Europe tests
about one in four.

The United States instead uses statistical models that it says will let a few
tests detect the infection even in one cow in a million. It now tests one in 90;
when the first mad cow case was found in 2003, it was testing one in 1,700.

With its statistical logic under regular attack, the United States has increased
the number of tests to 388,000 in the past year, from 40 in 1990. But until
recently, Mr. Johanns was discussing cutting back to 40,000 tests.

That system is ''bizarre, illogical and woefully inadequate,'' said John
Stauber, co-author of the book, ''Mad Cow U.S.A.,'' which was first published in
1997.

''The bottom line,'' he said, ''is that the U.S. government is afraid of putting
in real food-safety testing because it would certainly find additional cases.''

Mr. Loyd of the Agriculture Department replied that surveillance testing assumed
a few animals would be positive, and that his department had nearly doubled its
own goal of testing 220,000 cases in a year.

''There is no scientific basis,'' he said, for doing what Japan and many critics
want: testing all animals or all those more than 20 months old.

But even a scientist who helped design the department's testing now harbors
doubts about it.

In an interview before the second case was found, Dr. Linda A. Detwiler, who
retired in 2002 as the chief of the mad cow testing program and now teaches
veterinary medicine at the University of Maryland, said the department should be
using the Western blot test it was resisting.

''You need to put as many tools in your tool kit as possible,'' she said.

Mr. Loyd said Secretary Johanns now agreed. The beef industry now cites its
consumer-protecting ''firewalls.''

But it took many years to erect them: a ban on feeding ruminants to cattle, a
ban on using near-dead dairy cows as beef and a ban on using the brains and
spinal cords of older cattle in feed.

Other practices that many veterinarians dislike continue, such as feeding
poultry litter with spilled cattle meal in it back to cattle, giving calves
''milk replacer'' made from cattle blood and letting cows eat dried restaurant
''plate waste.''

Dr. Detwiler was adamant that those practices should end, and that the brains
and spines of all cattle should be destroyed, not made into feed even for pigs
or chickens.

''That's how you keep infectivity out of the food chain,'' she said. ''If a
farmer makes a mistake and gives pig feed to cattle by mistake, the feed is
safe.''

The beef lobby has opposed many changes, and statements from the industry and
the lobby often echo each other. When Mr. Johanns held a sort of pep rally for
beef in Minnesota recently, no consumer groups were on a panel that declared
American beef ''very, very safe,'' but lobbyists were.

The industry casts a long shadow over the department. Ann M. Veneman, a former
agriculture secretary, had as her spokeswoman Alisa Harrison, who, in 1996,
accused a doctors' group of being an animal rights group opposed to eating meat.
The doctors' group had endorsed the ban on feeding cattle or sheep to cattle.

Mr. Johanns, a former Nebraska governor who grew up on a dairy farm, inherited
two officials of the cattlemen's group, Charles Lambert and Dale Moore, as
deputies. His under secretary for farm and foreign agriculture services, J.B.
Penn, worked at a consulting firm serving the industry.

Last week, according to the Kyodo news service in Japan, a group of Japanese
lawmakers who visited Mr. Penn in Washington accused him of ''threatening'' them
with trade retaliation and saying that the United States' patience was growing
short and that they should simply accept American beef.

Mr. Loyd denied that, saying the meeting was ''cordial.''

Such connections to industry impede the department's duty to police it, said
Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the House
Appropriations Committee. (On Tuesday, the department announced $140 million in
grants to advertise American food overseas, including $12 million to the U.S.
Meat Export Federation.)

She wants a new, separate food safety agency, like the one Britain created in
1999.

But the department's harshest critic has emerged from within -- it is Ms. Fong,
the inspector general, who ordered the new round of tests.

Last spring, she issued a scathing analysis of the testing program, saying, for
example, that it could not do scientific sampling because it was voluntary,
tested too few healthy-looking cattle, and could not assure that sick but
walking cattle and cattle that died on farms were tested.

Foreigners continue to own just under 1 percent of United States agricultural
land, slightly more than the level of a year ago, the Department of Agriculture
said Thursday. The department's Economic Research Service said its 1987 year-end
review of reports under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act found
12.5 million acres of agricultural land in foreign hands, 202,000 acres more
than reported in 1986. Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land,
with the balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other
entities.

If you're thinking of being a pig .; Overeating experiments on pigs

BYLINE: JEREMY LAURANCE

SECTION: Issue 8576.

LENGTH: 318 words


CHRISTMAS gluttons, do not despair. Scientists in America and Britain may have
the answer to the miseries of new year dieting. Instead of studying humans to
find a solution to the problem of overeating they have turned their attention to
the great 'consumers' of the animal kingdom pigs.

Porkers, say the scientists, have an image problem. Most people think they
 chomp through tons of food. But they have actually been moderate eaters
  .until now.


 Scientists in the United States Agriculture Department set out to make pigs
more piggish, injecting them with a vaccine that gave them an insatiable hunger.
It works by counteracting the effects of a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK),
which induces a feeling of satiation when the stomach is full. In three months
the pigs hardly took their snouts out of the trough and put on 11lb more than
their less greedy friends.

Now scientists are asking if the experiment provides clues into how to reduce
eating. If you can make pigs gorge themselves, they reasoned, then it should be
possible to curb animal and human appetites.

One American researcher is now reported to be giving CCK to volunteer humans,
including those with eating disorders.

British researchers are also looking at the effects of CCK. At the Maudsley
Hospital in south London, Dr Tony Holland is studying patients with
Praader-Willi syndrome, which gives victims an insatiable appetite. One patient
went from 13 stone to 18 stone in a year. 'CCK is one of the things we are
measuring. Maybe Praader-Willi patients don't have it, ' he said.

But Professor John Garrow, an expert on obesity at St Bartholomew's Hospital,
London, said: 'CCK has some effect in man but it is much less dramatic because
we eat much less than pigs.'

For those who cannot wait for the ultimate diet pill, only a strong will stands
between them and gluttony on Christmas day.

TRACTOR SLUMP SEEN ENDING

BYLINE: By STEPHEN PHILLIPS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 1, Column 3; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1257 words

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 13


Charles B. Weeks and his wife, Lois, see nothing but ''great opportunity'' for
the tractor dealership they recently bought in Belvidere, Ill. ''There is a lot
of old and used equipment out there that has to be traded in,'' Mr. Weeks said.

It was an unexpectedly optimistic sounding from the farm equipment industry,
which is in its seventh year of slumping sales. But in the view of industry
officials and analysts, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Weeks, things should turn up in
1987. That is a result of a number of measures - many of them painful - that the
industry has taken in the last 18 months. Excess capacity, one of the industry's
biggest problems, has been slashed in half through mergers, bankruptcies and
restructuring. Bloated inventories, which led to years of sharp discounting,
have also been halved.

''The farm equipment market will bottom out in 1986,'' said Jerome K. Green,
president of Case IH, which is the second-largest farm equipment manufacturer,
after Deere & Company. ''And there are some good things going on that will make
1987 begin to turn up.''

Drop Seen in Farmers' Costs

Some of these things should improve farmers' lot, too. Falling petroleum prices
are expected to reduce farmers' fertilizer and fuel costs by $1.8 billion,
according to economists at the United States Department of Agriculture. Interest
rates have declined, too. And land prices - a key factor in determining farmers'
borrowing and buying power - have stopped falling.

The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, which earlier forecast that
farm income would fall in 1987, now says net income will increase 14 percent, to
$29.4 billion.

''Now it's just a matter of getting those farmers who are debt-free to stop
thinking the world is going to end,'' said John E. McGinty, an analyst with the
First Boston Corporation. ''Then sales will take off.'' The Farm and Industrial
Equipment Institute, an industry trade association, predicts that farm tractor
sales will edge up to 116,600 units in 1987, from their projected low of 114,350
this year.

Admittedly, the industry's struggle is not over. With demand for grain storage
bins outrunning capacity and with commodity prices still falling, many farmers
are hard-pressed to buy tractors and combines.

Revenues at Half of '79 Level

Industry sales for 1986 are expected to total $5.5 billion, their lowest point
since 1979's record of $11 billion. And Richard A. Loewy, a grain analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities, noted that the 1985 farm bill's scheduled decline
in price supports for grain, corn and wheat prices could pull prices down as
much as 22 percent in 1987.

But the industry has responded to the seven-year slump with layoffs and plant
closings that have sliced total employment to 53,000, from more than 100,000.
Product lines have been trimmed and some manufacturers have diversified. All
this has sharply reduced break-even levels.

The acquisition in 1985 by J. I. Case, a division of Tenneco Inc., of
International Harvester's nearly bankrupt agricultural equipment line was the
most significant step toward reducing overcapacity. The company, renamed Case IH
- whose market share grew to 30 percent from 20 percent through the acquisition
-promptly shut down Harvester's Farmall tractor plant in Moline, Ill., slashing
the industry's tractor capacity by 35 percent in one move. An effort to lower
Case IH's break-even point further over the next four years could mean three
more plant closings.

To cope with swollen dealer inventories, Case IH closed all 12 of its North
American plants for three months in 1985 and restricted production to less than
half of what its dealers sold. The resulting drop to a five-month stock from
nearly a full year supply saved about $70 million in interest costs, company
officials said. They plan to cut supplies to four-month levels by the end of
1986. 800 Fewer Dealers Since the merger, about 800 of the 2,600 North American
dealers who carried the Case or International Harvester lines have been dropped
or have voluntarily gone out of business. Some 5,000 workers have quit or been
laid off. Production levels are at 50 percent of capacity, up from 26 percent in
1985, and will be increased to 70 percent in 1987 - even without any upturn in
sales.

Case IH reported an operating profit of $18 million in the second quarter of
1986, ended in June, compared with an operating loss of $22 million a year
earlier. Even without an upturn in farm spending, Case IH should earn an
operating profit of $200 million in 1987, Mr. McGinty of First Boston predicted.

On the other hand, Deere, with more than half of the North American market, has
concentrated on improving plant efficiency. It has allocated $200 million this
year for plant modernization, up from $144 million in 1985. Throughout the
company, assembly operations can now be changed in minutes and many parts in its
product lines are interchangeable. Deere has thus reduced its break-even point
to less than 50 percent of capacity, from 75 percent, and plans to reduce it by
another 5 percent annually.

''We're looking at everything that does not add value, be it materials, labor or
overhead,'' said John K. Lawson, vice president of Deere's farm equipment and
consumer products manufacturing.

Diversification by Deere

Deere has also been diversifying, manufacturing equipment for a variety of
applications other than farming. It makes axles and chassis for Winnebago
Industries, the recreational vehicle maker. It even paints bumpers for Chrysler.
''We'll try to run anything we can through our plants,'' said L. Neel Hall,
Deere's senior vice president.

Last month Deere signed a joint venture with the General Motors Corporation to
manufacture and market diesel truck engines worldwide. Deere officials forecast
annual sales of about $1.5 billion.

But Deere has been slow to attack its farm equipment inventories, currently at
11-month levels. The company's reluctance to shut down facilities for an
extended period of time forced it to discount its estimated $1.5 billion worth
of inventories, analysts said.

Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber, predicted that Deere would lose
about $134 million on sales of $3.66 billion this year, compared with net income
of $30.5 million on sales of $4.06 billion in 1985. If Deere makes production
and personnel cuts, Mr. Lustgarten added, it could earn $30 million in 1987.

Other Consolidations

Elsewhere in the industry, there has also been consolidation and
diversification. The Sperry Corporation sold its New Holland division to the
Ford Motor Company's tractor operations. The Allis-Chalmers Corporation sold
most of its combine operations to Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz of West Germany.

Ford's farm division is manufacturing axles, drive trains and engines for more
than 100 foreign makers of industrial and earthmoving equipment. Ford has also
aggressively pursued what is considered the only growth market in agricultural
equipment - the under 40-horsepower tractor. That tractor, however is made in
Japan, leaving Ford and others the job of marketing it.

Most of the combine business of Massey-Ferguson Ltd., the Canadian company, has
been sold, and as part of a corporate restructuring, it has since changed its
name, to the Varity Corporation. The company has moved most of its production
facilities of its remaining product lines overseas and, like Ford, is marketing
low-horsepower tractors to take advantage of what is called the ''urban-suburban
market.''

Embassy to lodge US lamb protest

SECTION: NEWS; National; Pg. 7; NATIONAL BRIEFING

LENGTH: 144 words


Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton has asked New Zealand's embassy in
Washington to lodge a protest with the United States Department of Agriculture
at the $ 194 million farm aid package unveiled last weekend.

A spokesman for Mr Sutton, who is also Agriculture Minister, said yesterday he
issued the instruction on Tuesday after learning of the United States
Government's handouts for sheep farmers. The spokesman said Mr Sutton had also
asked the high commission in Canberra to work with Australian officials on a
joint response to the package. This follows US President Bill Clinton's decision
last year to bow to pressure from local farmers and slap tariffs on sheepmeat
imports from Australasia. The World Trade Organisation is considering a
complaint from New Zealand and Australia over the tariffs, which the United
States argues are legal.

SCIENCE WATCH;
The Productive Fungus

SECTION: Section C; Page 3, Column 5; Science Desk

LENGTH: 279 words


A fungus that lives symbiotically on the roots of wheat helps produce crop
yields that are twice as large as those produced by wheat that is uninfected by
the fungus, scientists at the United States Department of Agriculture Research
Service in Lincoln, Neb., have discovered. The fungi have a network of
microscopic filaments that penetrate plant roots and act as an extension of the
root system, enabling the roots to take up additional nutrients and moisture
from the soil.

James R. Ellis, a Department of Agriculture microbiologist, said that although
the fungus, known as vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae, had been known to soil
scientists, it had not been known that it could nourish wheat plants so they had
a better chance of surviving dry spells. The findings, the result of experiments
aimed at developing a drought-resistant wheat, were conducted under greenhouse
drought conditions in Lincoln.

In the greenhouse study, the researchers grew wheat in sterile soil four feet
deep so they could avoid growth conditions in which roots become restricted, and
so they could inoculate soil with the strains of the fungus they wanted to
study. Dr. Ellis said the findings showed that two common strains of the fungus
prevented drought-stressed wheat from having severely lowered yields. The fine
hairs of the fungi were found to penetrate places where the roots could not.

Reporting his findings to the American Society of Agronomy at its recent annual
meeting in Washington, Dr. Ellis noted that if the fungus could be transferred
to field-grown wheat it could save wheat and perhaps other grains that were lost
in this summer's extremely dry and hot weather.

RISE IN PORK PRODUCTION

BYLINE: David Mccoy

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 38

LENGTH: 208 words


TOTAL global pork production in 2001 is expected to increase by two per cent on
corresponding year-earlier levels, to just over 84 million tonnes, according to
the United States Department of Agriculture.

Gains in the United States, Canada, Brazil and China are likely to offset the
declines expected to occur in the European Union and Poland.

Total pork production in the United States is forecast to increase by two per
cent, or nearly 200,000 tonnes, on year-earlier levels, to almost 8.8 million
tonnes.

The biggest producer will continue to be China, where overall pork production is
forecast to increase by nearly four per cent, to 43.2 million tonnes.

Increases in production are also forecast for Canada, Mexico and Brazil.

Pork production in the EU, which accounted for approximately one-fifth of global
pork production in 2000, is forecast to decline by almost one per cent, to 17.3
million tonnes.

Within the EU, the USDA forecasts that the biggest declines will occur in Dutch
and United Kingdom production.

Polish pork production is forecast to decline by almost seven per cent on 2000
levels, to 1.5 million tonnes, while Japanese production is expected to be
marginally lower, at 1.26 million tonnes.

American Embassy leads trade mission to promote innovation in agriculture

SECTION: Vol. 40 No. 29

LENGTH: 306  words


US Embassy Economic Counselor Joel Robert Garverick will lead a delegation of
senior Pakistani government officials, businessmen, farmers and agriculture
experts to Atlanta, Georgia, from January 28 to February 4, to promote
U.S.-Pakistan bilateral commercial

ties and increase trade and investment in agriculture.

According to US embassy here, the delegation will attend the 2017 International
Production and Processing Expo (IPPE), the United States' largest annual trade
show for the poultry, meat, and feed industries, building on the theme,
'innovation in agriculture.'

Agriculture is Pakistan's leading industry, accounting for more than 20 per cent
of GDP and two-fifths of employment. Major products include cotton, wheat, rice,
sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, dairy, beef, mutton, poultry and eggs.

The United States is Pakistan's largest trading partner, exporting $447 million
in agricultural goods to Pakistan in 2015. These imports help support Pakistani
agricultural exports, which were $ 3.7 billion in fiscal year 15/16 (July-June).

Following the expo, the group will meet with U.S. agribusiness executives and
researchers, including experts at the Georgia Tech Agriculture Technology
Research Group and Innovation Lab, to explore innovations that could benefit
Pakistan, expand bilateral trade, and

create investment opportunities for U.S. companies.

The group will also visit a peach farm in Georgia, and conduct meetings with
Georgia's Farm Bureau, Cotton Commission, State Department of Agriculture, and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Research Service.

Representatives from all four provinces of Pakistan will take part in the trade
mission, as well as officials from the Ministry of Food Security and Research,
the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and the Mohammad Nawaz Sharif
University of Agriculture Multan.

Urban farming in China different;
Gardening

BYLINE: Pam Corle-Bennett

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 435 words


Last August I had the privilege to go to China with four of my Ohio State
University colleagues on an urban agriculture study tour. This was the first
time I had been to China.

As part of a United States Department of Agriculture partnership grant, our
group toured urban ag programs in Beijing, Zhengzhou, Nanjing and Shanghai in
August. In September a group of Chinese representatives from their Extension
service came to visit our OSU urban ag programs.

Most fascinating to me was the fact that urban agriculture in China is not the
same as it is in the United States.

Our urban agriculture focuses on growing food in urban areas such as community
gardens, urban farms and neighborhood gardens. Urban farming has increased in
popularity in recent years, and a lot of emphasis is on teaching people to
supplement their food with fresh produce.

OSU Extension has a signature program called Local Foods. Extension educators
and specialists around the state are working with people to create local food
programs.

I would consider urban agriculture in China similar to our agriculture
entertainment, or what's commonly called agritourism.

The focus is to help rejuvenate communities outside of the large cities by
creating an economic engine based on agriculture.

For instance, outside of Nanjing, we visited two communities that had thriving
urban agriculture. One emphasized growing tea and the other lavender.

Both of these communities had taken a crop and developed enterprises focused on
this crop. Tours of the fields, paths that you could walk, golf cart tours,
demonstrations, restaurants, shops and more all focused on the one agriculture
crop.

The goal was twofold; one was to reinvigorate the small rural communities, and
the other was to provide a respite or a relaxing atmosphere for those who live
in the city. They would drive two hours on a weekend, stay overnight in the
community, spend money and relax.

Another interesting farming practice that really blew me away was the production
of all kinds of crops in greenhouse or poly structures. These were unheated
greenhouse structures that are similar to our high-tunnel structures.

In China we saw grapes, apples, pears and bananas grown in these structures.
Again, the government was funding the use of these structures and the research.
China has a tremendous challenge in feeding the population, and they are looking
at all different kinds of ways to face this challenge.

TRAVERSE CITY -- Michigan produced a total of 5.22 million pounds of honey in
2015, a 9 percent decrease from 2014. Michigan ranked eighth in honey production
for both years. The average price of honey in Michigan also dropped 6 cents to
$2.43 per pound, with total value of production down 11 percent to $12.7
million.

February milk production

TRAVERSE CITY -- Michigan's dairy herds produced 855 million pounds of milk
during February, 11.6 percent more than last February, according to Marlo
Johnson, regional director of the Great Lakes office of the United States
Department of Agriculture's National Agriculture Statistics Service. The daily
rate per cow increased by 3.3 pounds in that time to a total of 71.2 pounds.

Agriculture is AMAZING

BYLINE: Weston County Gazette staff

LENGTH: 478  words


Take a moment to think about how far technology has brought us in America. We
can golf, go to movies, take a vacation, drive our kids to soccer games or watch
a football game with friends because we don't have to work day and night to grow
our own food thanks to agriculture!

If you stop and truly think about this it will fill you with wonder --
Agriculture is Amazing! It is astounding to think that today each United States
farmer produces food and fiber for 155 people in the United States and abroad.
Compare that to only 19 people in the year 1940 -- Agriculture is Amazing!

Advancements in agriculture have freed up people to do things other man grow
their own food. At an October 2010 forum in Torrington, Dr. Gary Sides, with
Pfizer Animal Health, said it best when he said: "There is no culture without
agriculture." Without technology

Having food that is readily available is all most of us have ever experienced in
our lifetime. The picture would be much different though if technology was
frozen in time.

"If technology was frozen in the year 1955, it would require an additional 450
million acres (the total land mass of Texas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and
Oklahoma) to produce the beef we are producing today," Sides commented.

"Globally, if we still achieved yields of 1960, an additional 15-20 milion
square miles of farmland would be needed to produce today's food supply," He
continued.

In 1961, the United States population was close to 184 million people. In 2006,
that number was greater than 300 million people. Sides related those numbers
back to 1960. "If agriculture technology today was the same as 1960, we would
either have to 1) expand acres by 63% or 2) decrease food consumption by 63% "He
explained.

21st century food challenge

It is predicted that the world population will increase to nine billion by 2050.
That means we will need a 50% increase in the food supply by 2030 and 100%
increase by 2050.

Sides commented there are simply two ways to meet global food demand. "One is to
take more land from nature (divert Yellowstone, the Black Hills or the Brazilian
rain forests into agricultural lands). The other choice is to produce more per
acre or per animal on lands currently in agricultural production," He said.
"Which alternative do you prefer?"

Sides points out that farming technology enables U.S. agriculture to produce 70%
more corn from each pound of fertilizer, use 50-80% less water, decrease soil
erosion by 43% in the last 20 years and produce 18% of the world's total food
supply on only 10% of the world's land mass. We have food

The old quote comes to mind: "When people have food, they have a lot of
problems. When people don't have food, they only have one problem." Fortunately,
thanks to agriculture and the impacts of technological advances, we don't have
to worry about not having food to eat--Agriculture is Amazing!

Officials mark arrival of Uruguayan citrus in U.S.

BYLINE: By Linda Loyd; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; P-com Biz; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 758 words


Agriculture officials from Uruguay and the United States gathered at the Packer
Avenue Marine Terminal in South Philadelphia on Monday to mark the first
shipment of Uruguayan citrus fruit to the United States.

On a nearby pier, a Hamburg Sud refrigerated cargo ship had unloaded five
containers of Valencia oranges, which had arrived Sunday and were being taken by
truck to local distribution centers.

About 15 percent to 20 percent of all cargoes arriving at ports and terminals on
the Delaware River, in Philadelphia, South Jersey, and Wilmington, is fresh
fruit - bananas, grapes, kiwis, apples, pears, and citrus from Chile and other
nations.

And now Uruguay.

"It's important because it's the first time that Uruguayan citrus has been
permitted in the United States," said Robert Blackburn, the Philadelphia Port
Authority's deputy executive director.

Uruguay exports other goods to the United States, including meat, leather, fish,
and dairy products, said Ricardo Baluga, deputy chief of the Embassy of Uruguay
to the United States.

"This first shipment of citrus marks nearly 19 years of hard work and
negotiations between the United States and Uruguay," Baluga said. "We have
reached new levels of safety and look forward to expanding our offerings."

The shipment that arrived Sunday was a trial run before the Uruguayan fruit
season begins in May and continues through September.

Next summer, three varieties of Uruguayan mandarins, as well as oranges and some
lemons, will come regularly into the Philadelphia port.

A protocol was recently finalized between Uruguayan agriculture officials and
U.S. regulators that requires pest monitoring and control practices, grove
sanitation, and packinghouse requirements to eliminate potential pests and
bacteria and ensure safe importation.

"We are eager to expand this exciting new pipeline of goods into the U.S.," said
Leo Holt, president of Holt Logistics Corp., whose family runs the terminal.
"Our strategic location, with extensive transportation infrastructure and access
to over 100 million people within a day's drive, makes our port ideal for any
exporter looking to tap into the U.S. market."

Over the years, California citrus growers have been a strong lobby seeking to
limit competition from foreign suppliers, particularly Argentina, which lost its
right to bring citrus into United States 10 years ago.

Uruguay's citrus-producing season does not overlap with the U.S. season, said
Bruce McEvoy of Seald Sweet International, fruit importers and exporters in Vero
Beach, Fla. The Uruguayan exports are important to the small country, which
"needs to diversify its agricultural base," McEvoy said.

Bruce Cahan, officer in charge of the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in Southeastern Pennsylvania, acknowledged the
years of "hard work" to bring the citrus here. "Our goal was to facilitate trade
and continue ensuring the health of U.S. agriculture. We are pleased to see the
results."

McEvoy told the crowd: "It's been a very long journey. Lots of patience was
needed along the way. Over the years, I can recall meeting with three of the
former presidents of Uruguay, with four ministers of agriculture, and with
ambassadors on both sides, U.S. and Uruguay."

Since 2000, imported citrus fruit has increased twentyfold, exceeding 200,000
metric tons this year, McEvoy said. "Summer citrus has emerged as a category,
and the buyers have converted. Joining Australia now, we have Chile, Peru, South
Africa, and today, the newest entry, Uruguay."

U.S. SEEKS TO CUT FARM EXPORT LOSS

BYLINE: By SETH S. KING, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 2, Column 2; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 739 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 19


Farm exports by the United States continue to decline, and so once again
American trade and agriculture officials will hold talks with their European
Economic Community counterparts this week to ask them to stop subsidizing grain
and meat sales.

At the same time, an American trade delegation will resume talks in Moscow on a
new long-term grain trade agreement with the Soviet Union.

And on Friday in Paris, Deputy Agriculture Secretary Richard E.  Lyng will
discuss the growing problems of agricultural trade with officials of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Among the 24 members of
the O.E.C.D. are Japan and the Common Market nations, the two largest customers
for United States farm exports, as well as Australia and Canada, two major grain
exporters.

$9 Billion Loss of Trade

Export subsidies by the Common Market countries and by Argentina and Brazil will
cause other nations to lose more than $9 billion in foreign sales this year, of
which the United States will lose $6 billion, the Agriculture Department said
last week.

In retaliation, the United States will allocate more than $4.8 billion this year
to subsidize sales of American grain and cotton to developing countries, to
guarantee export loans to these countries and, in a special instance, for Egypt
to buy American flour at below market rates instead of purchasing it from France
at a subsidized price.

The department said it expects United States' food and cotton sales abroad to
fall for the fourth year in a row in 1983, to 149 million metric tons, the
lowest level since 1979. Last year these sales totaled 158 million tons, and in
1980 they were 162 million tons.

American farmers must export two-thirds of their wheat, half their soybeans and
at least a third of their corn and feed grain crops, or else surpluses rise and
their prices fall.

Recent Record Crops

For the past two years, American farmers have grown record grain crops. This
year, the prospects are excellent for more bumper wheat, corn and soybean crops
despite the Reagan Administration's new programs that have reduced acreage for
these crops by about one third. Grain and cotton supplies in the United States
have moved up to their highest level since the early 1970's.

The increasing use of subsidies by this country's competitors is only one factor
contributing to the foreign trade problem, American trade officials said last
week.

They also attributed the decline to unusually large world supplies of grain. The
Agriculture Department reported this month that world wheat stocks were at
record levels. World supplies of corn were at their highest point in five years.
Although soybean crops in Brazil have been hurt by bad weather, world stocks
were expected to remain high.

Daniel G. Amstutz, recently appointed Under Secretary of Agriculture for
International Affairs, also said that high interest rates, by pushing up the
value of the dollar, are making American commodities more expensive in the world
market.

But most disturbing, he said, was the capture of American markets by Argentina,
Brazil and the Common Market countries, which have been subsidizing exports of
grain and poultry and underselling this country.

Before President Carter curtailed grain shipments to the Soviet Union in 1980,
the United States delivered 70 percent of Russia's grain purchases. This fell to
20 percent last year. Part of this loss was attributed to subsidized exports
from the Common Market and Argentina.

Soviet Discussions

The United States hopes to persuade the Russians to sign another five-year grain
purchase agreement and to increase their annual purchases of American corn and
wheat. Under an agreement that expires in September, they were obligated to buy
between six million and eight million metric tons of these grains annually.

American trade and agriculture officials did not expect any marked progress in
the talks with the Common Market this week in Washington.  But the American
representatives expect some flexibility among the Common Market officials
because of the rapidly rising costs of export subsidies. The Common Market
spends more than 70 percent of its agriculture budget for these subsidies,
American officials said.

U.S. crop estimates hit by rain, drought

BYLINE: Mary Lou Peter Reuter

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 471 words

DATELINE: Chicago, IL


Twin U.S. disasters - the Midwestern flood and a drought in the southeast - will
dent the fall harvest, but higher prices could provide a boon to many farmers
who manage to produce a crop, agriculture analysts said yesterday.

''I think everybody's flying by the seat of their pants,'' said grains analyst
Dale Durchholz of AgriVisor Services Inc. as he estimated the magnitude of crop
losses.

He expects U.S. farms to produce 1.8 billion to 1.85 billion bushels of soybeans
this year, with a maximum of 1.9 billion. The figure is down from the
Agriculture department's latest estimate of 1.975 billion bushels.

USDA will update its estimate Aug. 11.

''The biggest problem is that we don't have a rock-solid acreage figure,''
Durchholz said, adding that without good estimates for the number of acres
actually planted in the waterlogged Midwest, it is ''almost impossible'' to
estimate average yields.

On June 30, the Agriculture department estimated that 74.259 million acres were
planted to corn and 61.6 million acres were planted to soybeans.

But two weeks and several torrential rain storms later, Agriculture Secretary
Mike Espy said at least eight million acres of cropland had been flooded and
that there were ''20 million plus acres adversely affected by this situation.''

The ''situation'' has only worsened since.

Bedford, Mass.-based Weather Services Corp. said the western corn-belt has
received an average of 9.3 inches of rain or 241% of normal in the past 30 days.
In the eastern belt, rainfall averaged 8.4 inches or 225% of normal during the
period.

In stark contrast, states in the southeast have averaged just 3.5 inches of rain
in the past 30 days and many areas, particularly the Carolinas, have been much
drier.

ADM Investor Services analyst Steve Freed said making an assessment of the corn
and soybean crops in the U.S. now is almost impossible and that a truly accurate
picture may not unfold until the department's January report.

At this point Freed expects corn production at 7.6 million bushels with an
average yield of 114.5 bushels per acre. He expects soybean production of 1.88
million bushels with average yields of 32 bushels per acre.

Those numbers could change as the season progresses, Freed said.

The disparity in crop conditions through key growing regions and the uncertainty
regarding this year's production has rocked Chicago's grain futures market.

At the Chicago Board of Trade, November delivery soybeans soared to a year high
of US$7.57 1/2 a bushel on July 19 - a 25% rise from the US$6.08 1/2 level of a
month earlier.

Yesterday, November soybeans retreated sharply on a Midwest forecast for warmer
and drier weather, dropping US17.5 cents to US$7.09 1/2 a bushel. December corn
fell US3 cents to US$2.48 1/2 a bushel.

Vanclief may hike farming subsidies: Minister threatens to battle back against
U.S. support for agriculture: Exports threatened

SOURCE: Bloomberg News

BYLINE: Kevin Carmichael

SECTION: Financial Post: News; Pg. FP10

LENGTH: 390 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA

OTTAWA - Lyle Vanclief, Minister of Agriculture, said Canada may boost farm
subsidies to compete with new U.S. measures and bolster production in one of the
world's biggest grain exporters.

The six-year, US$51.7-billion farm bill would increase subsidies for big grain
and cotton growers by 80%.

That would drop commodity prices and hurt producers in other countries, critics
from Europe to South America say. George W. Bush, U.S. President, has said he
will sign the bill.

The European Union, Canada, Australia and Brazil say the legislation breaks a
commitment by the United States to cut subsidies, and have threatened a
challenge at the Geneva-based World Trade Organization. Canada is one of the
first to say it's considering boosting aid to keep pace with the United States.

"We pledged to continue to pursue means to challenge and counter [the U.S.
legislation's] effect on the marketing of Canadian agricultural products and
Canadian farmers," Mr. Vanclief said on a conference call with reporters after
meeting with provincial farm ministers in Ottawa.

Mr. Vanclief said he would take a proposal to cabinet, though he refused to say
when or how much he would ask for.

The Canadian Federation of Agriculture, which represents some 200,000 farmers,
has said the U.S. measures will cost the group's members $1.3-billion a year.

Canada is the world's third-largest wheat exporter after the United States and
Australia, and leads in shipments of canola and oats. Canadian producers drew on
$3.7-billion in government support payments to offset drought conditions and
poor commodity prices last year, a 32% increase from 2000 and just short of
1992's record of $3.8-billion, according to Statistics Canada.

Canadian farm aid was worth $58 per hectare in 2000, while the EU gave its
farmers $655 and the United States paid $116, according to the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Japan was highest at
$12,307 per hectare and Australia the lowest at $2, the 30-member OECD said.

Mr. Vanclief wouldn't say when he would decide on a WTO challenge. He said he
planned to call counterparts from the EU, Australia and developing countries to
discuss ways to challenge the U.S. bill.

"I think [the United States] has annoyed the whole world."

Washington: Country of origin label for meat cuts endangered

LENGTH: 657  words

DATELINE: Washington


Association of Western Pulp & Paper Workers has issued the following news
release:

Package labels on fresh cuts of meat that identify where animals were born,
raised and slaughtered face an uncertain future after successful trade
challenges from Canada and Mexico.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says the U.S. is running out of options for
the meat labels, which are required under a 2008 law. A label might say, for
example, that the animal was "born in Canada, raised and slaughtered in the
United States" or "born, raised and slaughtered in the United States."

The World Trade Organization has agreed more than once with Canada and Mexico
that the labels on steaks, ribs and other cuts of fresh meat give the U.S.
livestock industry an unfair advantage. In its most recent ruling Oct. 20, the
WTO said the labeling requirement forced meatpackers to segregate and keep
detailed records on imported livestock, giving them an incentive to favor U.S.
livestock.

The trade organization ruled in 2011 and upheld in 2012 that an earlier version
of the labels was discriminatory.

A spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the United States
has not decided whether it will appeal the latest WTO decision. If the October
ruling stands, Canada and Mexico could retaliate against the United States with
other trade sanctions if the labels aren't changed or scrapped.

Vilsack said he believes Congress either needs to change the law or Mexico and
Canada need to negotiate a settlement with the United States.

"There is no apparent regulatory solution available that could make this rule
compliant with the WTO's recent decision and also uphold the law Congress
passed," Vilsack said in a statement.

Canada and Mexico need to tell the U.S. "more clearly and more specifically,
what, if any, variation of this will work for them," the agriculture secretary
said last week at an event in Kansas City, Missouri.

The embattled labeling rules have support from consumer groups and some farm
groups. U.S. ranchers who raise cattle near the northern border and compete with
Canadian ranchers have pushed hardest for the labeling law, which Congress
originally wrote in 2002 and revised in 2008 after years of haggling with the
meat industry. Ranchers and meatpackers in the Southwest who do a lot of
business with Mexico have traditionally opposed it.

It's unclear what lawmakers will do. But the new Republican Congress is expected
to be friendly to the meat industry, which has called for repeal of the
country-of-origin labeling law, saying it is burdensome. Meatpackers have sued
the government to block it, so far unsuccessfully.

Farm-state lawmakers said earlier this year that they didn't have the votes for
repeal. But Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, the incoming chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, and Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., expected to head the Senate
agriculture panel, are both from cattle-heavy states and have championed the
meat industry.

After the ruling was issued, more than 100 meat, agriculture and food industry
groups concerned about sanctions down the road called on Congress to immediately
repeal parts of the rule.

"Given the negative impact on the U.S. manufacturing and agriculture economies,
we respectfully submit that it would be intolerable for the United States to
maintain, even briefly, a rule that has been deemed non-compliant by the WTO,"
the industry groups wrote.

Canada is also calling for congressional action.

"The onus is now on the United States to put forward a solution acceptable to
all parties that removes the unfair segregation and discrimination against
Canadian cattle and hogs," Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said in a
statement to The Associated Press. He said Canada "will take whatever steps may
be necessary, including retaliation, to achieve a fair resolution."

U.S.-EUROPEAN FARM TALKS

BYLINE: Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 3, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 669 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9


Five Cabinet officers will meet Friday in Brussels with ministers of the
European Economic Community for what the Agriculture Department says will be the
final attempt to persuade Common Market countries to stop subsidizing farm
exports.

If the talks fail to gain any concessions, as a senior department official
believes will happen, the Administration is threatening retaliation within the
next month.

''Our patience is wearing out,'' said Secretary John R. Block. ''We had hoped
for more from the Common Market at last month's GATT meetings in Geneva. But
their officials insisted that export subsidies were permissible under the GATT
rules.''

''If that is indeed the case, then surely they cannot object to the United
States proceeding accordingly,'' Mr. Block added. ''They may claim that this
will disrupt their markets. But that's not going to stop us. We will do what we
have to do so our farmers can compete in world markets.''

GATT is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, subscribed to by 88 nations.


Pressure on Both Sides

The United States contends that the government subsidies give the Europeans
unfair advantages in competing for world agriculture markets, some of which they
have captured from American exporters.

American exporters and farmers and Congressmen from farm states are demanding
immediate retaliation against the Common Market. But the Common Market ministers
say they are facing similar pressures from their farmers to make no concessions.

A special group has been set up within the Agriculture Department to develop new
regulations for subsidizing export sales, according to a senior department
official who asked not to be identified.

The official said the department planned to start ''dumping'' some of its vast
stores of surplus dairy products on world markets, although this is still not
final Administration policy. Dumping means selling products abroad for less than
they would fetch in domestic markets.

If that failed to force European nations to reduce their subsidies, the official
added, the Administration would start subsidizing exports of poultry and offer
subsidized loans to developing countries with which to buy American grain.

Members of Delegation

The American delegation will include Mr. Block, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
and Bill Brock, the special trade representative.

Friction between the United States and Europe has increased in recent disputes
over steel imports and the Soviet natural gas pipeline. But trade experts say
these problems will seem minor compared with the trade war developing over farm
exports.

For the past three years, both the volume and the value of America's share of
these exports have declined. And since 1978, the Common Market has gone from
being a net importer of wheat, sugar, meat and eggs to being a major exporter,
with the value of these exports rising by 164 percent.

$8 Billion in Subsidies

In the 1981-82 marketing year just ended, the 10 Common Market members spent
more than $8 billion subsidizing farm exports, according to the Agriculture
Department.

Part of the decline in America's market share was due to greatly increased grain
and meat production in other countries. But large shares of these markets, the
United States now charges, have been grabbed unfairly by Common Market
countries, led by France, and by Brazil and Argentina, all of whom - according
to the Agriculture Department - use some form of subsidy.

The United States tried last month, during the GATT talks in Geneva, to discuss
farm subsidies. But Common Market officials refused, declaring they would not
even consider changing either export policies or farm price supports.

ANALYSTS QUESTION CONTINUATION OF SUBSIDIZING GRAIN EXPORTS

BYLINE: HOWARD SIMON; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: FRONT, Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 791 words


The United States may have to decide soon the wisdom of continuing to offer
low-priced grains to foreign customers at the expense of depleting supplies at
home, analysts say.

According to these analysts, continuing to encouraging overseas grain sales
through export subsidies may be imprudent because of drought-related crop osses.

Farmers dipping into their reserves to replenish crops lost to this summer's
drought could determine the amount of subsidized export grain, says Steve Freed,
senior grain analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

The Export Enhancement Program, as it is known, subsidizes exporters who sell
grain to traditional U.S. customers. The program has been a boon to U.S.
agriculture exporters, who have sold millions of tons of grain to the Soviet
Union, China and various North African and Middle Eastern nations.

The Reagan administration is reluctant to cut the program because it has helped
U.S. agriculture stay competitive in the world market, analysts said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the subsidies, also noted
that the program has contributed to the narrowing of the trade deficit.

Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said recently that the United States has no
intention of cutting off grain exports. We will continue to be exporting this
year, Mr. Lyng said, although he acknowledged that the United States may not be
as aggressive as in the past, as a result of drought-reduced supplies.

However, the United States could see drastic reductions in grain surpluses next
year because of the Midwest drought, and we have to chip away at our reserves,
said Arthur Parrish, senior grain analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton.

We always see ourselves as having great surpluses, Mr. Parrish said, but that
could change if drought conditions persist into next year.

Mr. Parrish noted that grain reserves built up during the bumper crop years of
the mid-1980s will still tend to blunt a drastic drop in grain production this
year.

Still, analysts are in general agreement that there is little chance that grain
silos will be bulging after the fall harvest because grain and soybean crops
will be the smallest in years no matter how favorable the weather turns.

Tuesday's special report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on the grain and
soybean crop as of July may give a clearer picture of drought-damage and the
nation's grain supplies as of July 1.

Grain traders said the report will show reductions in all crops and project
severely diminished stocks of spring wheat and less severe losses in oats, corn
and soybeans by the fall harvest.

Recent pronouncements by the USDA project no serious shortages of most grains
and soybean stocks on Sept. 1.

Recent stock figures, released by the Agriculture Department in June showed that
government and farmer-led reserves, prior to this year's plantings, were at 1.27
billion bushels; corn at 4.54 billion bushels; and soybeans at 655 million
bushels.

Exacerbating the growing fear of reduced supplies, the United States is facing
stiff competition from the European Community's own subsidized export program.

Curbing a booming U.S. agricultural export trade is not easy, said Dean Witter's
Mr. Freed, especially when major U.S. competitors are stepping up their
agricultural exports.

European competitors, who have taken a more aggressive stance on exporting
grain, have come under attack by U.S. agricultural officials who have
characterized the activity as taking advantage of the U.S. drought.

The European Community has denied it is exploiting any wheat export
opportunities that might arise from the U.S. drought. (Story Page 6A.)

Nevertheless, the EC has stepped up its grain sales, exporters said, with recent
subsidized sales of 300,000 metric tons of flour going to Egypt and 50,000
metric tons to North Yemen.

The United States countered EC subsidized sales over the past year by offering
low-priced wheat and corn under the more than $ 2 billion government- funded
Export Enhancement Program.

In addition to the Soviet Union (buying about 14 million metric tons of grain in
the past 12 months) China has been been a customer for U.S. grain (nearly 6
million metric tons in the past year.) China has also been in a drought
situation.

U.S. wheat exports of 40.58 million metric tons for the 1987-88 marketing year,
ended May 31, zoomed by 65 percent of last year's total of 24.56 million was
helped by the export subsidy program.

Analysts said there are mitigating factors that could relieve some pressure on
U.S. export demand. The Soviet Union could lean less heavily on grain imports
because of increased domestic production, put at about 215 million to 218
million metric tons.

Vanclief slams U.S. farm aid policies;
Says rhetoric belies reality of subsidies

BYLINE: BARRIE McKENNA, Washington Bureau

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 347 words

DATELINE: Washington


The United States continues to boost aid to its own farmers even as it vows to
get rid of agricultural subsidies elsewhere in the world, Canadian Agriculture
Minister Lyle Vanclief complained yesterday.

As efforts continue to revive stalled global trade talks at the World Trade
Organization, the U.S. has quietly restored its own farm subsidies to the record
levels hit more than a decade ago, Mr. Vanclief said as he emerged from a
meeting with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman in Washington.

"When the United States continues to increase [its] support to producers and at
the same time say[s] to the world 'you shouldn't be doing that,' it raises a lot
of questions in people's minds," Mr. Vanclief told reporters. "Where's the
rhetoric and where's the reality?"

Canadian officials said the United States will transfer $25-billion (U.S.) to
farmers this year, based on spending already approved by Congress. Much of that
aid is destined for wheat farmers, who have been hit hard by depressed world
commodity prices.

U.S. wheat subsidies have now reached $50 per ton, compared with $15 a ton in
Canada, a top Canadian official noted.

But Mr. Vanclief said one of the most divisive issues in Canada-U.S. farm trade
- the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board - didn't come up during an annual
bilateral meeting between the countries' top farm officials.

Nonetheless, the U.S. has repeatedly vowed to target the CWB's practices in any
new round of trade talks - most recently in a submission late last month to the
WTO in Geneva.

Mr. Vanclief also warned the U.S. that proposed new health regulations in North
Dakota for imported cattle and hogs may violate WTO pacts and the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

"If we feel that whatever is done is not in accordance with the WTO and the
NAFTA, we'll take the challenge to the next step" he said.

Mr. Vanclief complained that the proposed North Dakota measures, now out for
comment, are aimed directly at hindering imports from Canada.

He is slated to meet with U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky today.

Goldman Unit Settles Case

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

SECTION: Section D;  Page 2;  Column 5;  Financial Desk

LENGTH: 193 words


A commodities subsidiary of Goldman, Sachs & Company agreed yesterday to pay $7
million to settle Government allegations involving a former employee's
submission of false information to obtain United States agricultural subsidies.

The subsidiary, J. Aron & Company, reached the settlement with the United States
Attorney's office in Manhattan without admitting wrongdoing or acknowledging
that it knew about the former employee's activities. The United States
Attorney's office declined to name the former employee.

A Goldman, Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the settlement.

According to the settlement, the former J. Aron worker provided false data to
get more subsidies than J. Aron was entitled to receive under a Department of
Agriculture program to encourage agricultural exports. The false information to
the Commodities Credit Corporation, which administers the United States Export
Enhancement Program, helped J. Aron win $5.6 million in subsidies between 1990
and 1991, the Federal prosecutors said.

J. Aron is a New York-based commodities broker for producers and distributors of
farm products, crude oil and other commodities.

Pakistan needs to increase agriculture production: US official

BYLINE: AMIN AHMED

SECTION: Vol. 70 No. 64

LENGTH: 409  words


Pakistan would need to increase agriculture production from its existing land
resources but with lesser water to feed its additional 20 million people by
2050, said Jocelyn G. Brown, a senior official of the US department of
agriculture, on Thursday.

Ms Brown, the department's deputy administrator of foreign agricultural service,
was speaking at inauguration of the National Bio-Control Laboratory at the
National Agriculture Research Centre.

She seemed to be convinced that the government and people of Pakistan fully
understood the challenges vis-a-vis feeding the growing population of the
country.

We need the highest level of commitment from our governments and partners to
further enhance agricultural production to feed the nine billion people in the
world by 2050, she said. Our two governments value the agriculture sector for
food security, added Ms Brown, who served as a Peace Corps volunteer at the
University of Agriculture in Peshawar from 1988 to 1990.

The US official said our joint effort to improve agriculture productivity has
taken on a new urgency. Changing climates in both the United States and Pakistan
are threatening the production of staple crops... Rain is hitting Pakistan
earlier and in the US weather is much more severe than before.

Over the last five years, she said, the Centre for Agriculture and Bio-Science
International had collaborated with Pakistani scientists to support projects in
the areas of animal disease, crop estimation, water management and capacity.

About the national bio-control laboratory, Ms Brown said the work undertaken
there would help farmers control harmful insect attacks on sugar and other
crops, reduce the use of dangerous chemicals, and ensure safer food supplies in
Pakistan and the world.

She said our governments and institutions can work together to introduce new
technologies and research. The United States and Pakistan share the goal of
supporting farmers across Pakistan and the globe to ensure that we have safe and
nutritious food in adequate amounts especially for those people who have little
income and who are most under-served people in the world.

About the capability of Pakistani scientists, she said: I think Pakistan can
bring knowledge to other parts of the world including the United States and
helpful to all agricultural systems.

Dr Babar Bajwa and Dr Nadeem Amjad also spoke on the occasion and thanked the US
government for its assistance for setting up the laboratory.

U.S. farmers dig in over GATT

BYLINE: Kelly McParland

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 429 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


The Clinton administration has a new problem to face with America's restive
farmers.

Already pressing the administration to get tough with Canada over an array of
Canadian agricultural exports, farmers have notified the White House they don't
want to get stuck with the bill for the newly minted world trade pact, either.

Following approval of the pact in Marrakech, reports indicated President Bill
Clinton planned big cuts in farm programs to offset the estimated US$13.9
billion the U.S. will lose in tariff revenue.

A group of 21 agriculture organizations wrote Clinton to protest, and recruited
a powerful group of legislative allies who warned this week that congressional
approval of the agreement will be ''seriously complicated'' if farm programs are
slashed.

''You can't afford to lose 17 votes'' for the pact, Senate agriculture committee
chairman Patrick Leahy told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, referring
to the number of senators supporting the farmers.

'HEAVY WINNERS'

Kantor promised that farmers ''will not pick up the tab'' for the agreement. But
he added that agriculture is a among the ''heavy winners'' in the pact and the
White House feels those who benefit should help carry the cost.

Administration officials say farmers will gain billions of dollars in new
exports to markets opened up in the pact.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates wheat exports will increase US$100
million a year by 2000 and US$600 million a year by 2005. Beef exports should
increase US$1.7 billion by 2005.

Opponents counter that agriculture budgets have been shrinking for years and
benefits will be reduced further because of subsidy reductions agreed to in the
pact.

''To many in my state it appears we've given up way too much in exchange for
much too little,'' said Montana Senator Max Baucus. ''We went to war without our
armor, and came back without our clothing.''

The farmers' opposition complicates Clinton's effort to win congressional
approval for the pact in time for it to take effect Jan. 1, as pledged.

The White House must produce a formula to replace the lost revenues before it
can send the deal to Congress. Republicans have opposed suggestions the
administration be granted a waiver on replacing the funds.

NO DECISIONS

Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said the administration has not made any
decisions on farmers' share of the bill.

He said about 5% of the lost tariffs will come from agriculture products, and
indicated farmers will be expected to foot at least that much.

Forecasts of world soybean crop grows

SECTION: Agribusiness

LENGTH: 195 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo and Washington, DC, 11/13/02

The American government foresees a 2.4% increase in world soybean production.
The projection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the
2002/03 crop is 188.8 million metric tonnes, in the report disclosed Tuesday.
Last year the harvest was 184.3 million tonnes.  The crop of the United States,
the world's biggest producer of the grain, should total 73.2 million tonnes,
1.35% more than foreseen in October forecasts. "The market expected an increase
of up to 74 million tonnes," said Renato Sayeg, of Tetras Corretora brokerage.
With this, futures prices of soybeans fell 1% in Chicago. For Brazil, the USDA
estimate is 49 million tonnes, 2% more than was forecast in October and 12.6%
greater than the 2001/02 crop. The Department also revised upward the Argentine
crop. The outlook is for the harvest to reach 32.5 million tonnes, volume 4.8%
greater than the October projection.  With the greater production, world soybean
stocks should reach the end of the crop year with 29.68 million metric tonnes,
volume 13.6% greater than that foreseen in October.  (Luciana Franco, Gazeta

World soybean crop increases

SECTION: Front Page

LENGTH: 195 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo and Washington, DC, 11/13/02

The American government foresees a 2.4% increase in world soybean production.
The projection of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the
2002/03 crop is 188.8 million metric tonnes, in the report disclosed Tuesday.
Last year the harvest was 184.3 million tonnes.  The crop of the United States,
the world's biggest producer of the grain, should total 73.2 million tonnes,
1.35% more than foreseen in October forecasts. "The market expected an increase
of up to 74 million tonnes," said Renato Sayeg, of Tetras Corretora brokerage.
With this, futures prices of soybeans fell 1% in Chicago. For Brazil, the USDA
estimate is 49 million tonnes, 2% more than was forecast in October and 12.6%
greater than the 2001/02 crop. The Department also revised upward the Argentine
crop. The outlook is for the harvest to reach 32.5 million tonnes, volume 4.8%
greater than the October projection.  With the greater production, world soybean
stocks should reach the end of the crop year with 29.68 million metric tonnes,
volume 13.6% greater than that foreseen in October.  (Luciana Franco, Gazeta

Brazilian agricultural advance already bothers USA

SECTION: Front Page

LENGTH: 225 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo, 06/18/2003

Country leads in production of sugar, orange juice and coffee. A Brazilian
ambassador with vast experience in the United States and Europe, and profound
knowledge of American negotiating tactics, read a report by the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) published in January and could not contain himself. "When the
charity is generous, the saint is suspicious," he said. The USDA document is
more optimistic about the prospects of Brazilian agriculture than the government
statistics show.  "The future of agriculture in Brazil has enormous potential
and the estimates that have been made about the scope of a possible agricultural
expansion are largely underestimated," accorcding to the report entitled
"Brazil: Future Agricultural Expansion Potential Underrated." The document gives
an idea of how the evolution and potential of Brazilian farming preoccupies the
United States.  Brazil is the world's leading producer and exporter of sugar,
first in production and export of orange juice and coffee; the second leading
producer of soybeans after the United States and taking the lead in exports;
second in world ranking of beef production; second in the production of chicken,
and the third leading producer of corn and fruits. Another statistic that shocks
the Americans: the productivity of cotton increased 121% between 1995 and 2002.

'Chicken War' Rhetoric Cools

BYLINE: Reuters, MT

SECTION: No. 907

LENGTH: 907 words


COMBINED REPORTS

A top Russian agriculture official expressed confidence Monday the dispute
between Russia and United States over the question of poultry imports can be
resolved short of an outright trade war.

Russian officials say American food inspection and certification procedures are
not up to Russian standards. They want to outlaw U.S. poultry imports starting
March 16 unless U.S. exporters prove their chicken is disease- and
additive-free.

The threat has provoked protests from U.S. officials. But Vyacheslav Avilov,
head of the Russian Agriculture Ministry's veterinary department, said Monday
that negotiations should ease the problem.

"We are absolutely sure that the Americans will fulfil all our requirements and
we will reach an agreement," Avilov said.

But while expressing his eagerness for negotiations, he declined to give a
timetable for talks. "That all depends on the American side," he said.

"This is an issue of both quality and certification," he added. "We need
guarantees that these birds are disease-free, quality products - that there is
no salmonella, no bad chemical additives, or the like. The U.S. must meet its
responsibilities for the problem to go away."

A U.S. Department of Agriculture official said Friday that Washington might
review agriculture trade ties with Russia if the ban goes through. Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said Russia was using "inaccurate science or incomplete
data" in evaluating sanitary norms.

U.S. chicken imports are big business in Russia, which imported over $ 500
million worth of chicken in 1995, 70 percent of which came from the United
States.

The U.S. birds are on the same market as Russian ones, which are scrawny, gray
and unappealing. Chickens from both countries are often sold from barely
-refrigerated containers or on the street in cardboard boxes.

Food handlers in grocery shops weigh chickens on unwashed scales before slapping
them unwrapped onto grimy counter tops. On Saturday, one shop in central Moscow
sold thawed U.S. poultry from a dirty cardboard box dripping with blood and fat.

A salesgirl, trying to separate a block of frozen chicken legs into individual
pieces, wrapped it in newspaper, heaved it onto the filthy floor and stamped on
it with her muddy boots.

The threat of a permanent poultry ban reflects more than sanitary concerns,
however.

Russia's 1995 grain harvest was the worst in 30 years and has fueled fears there
may not be enough to eat this year. Imports now make up 45 percent of the
domestic food market. Russian poultry farmers, angered by the cheap U.S.
imports, are demanding protection and government budget handouts.

Alexander Pesov, vice president of Soyuzkontrakt, Russia's biggest poultry
importer, said complaints about U.S. chicken quality were rife. He denied Russia
was trying to protect domestic producers.

"There were and are serious complaints about quality," Pesov said, adding that
water content was high.

He said the Russian market could put up with a ban on U.S. chickens for at least
a month, because domestic meat reserves and lower consumption during Russian
Orthodox Lent would drive demand down.  ()

Agriculture Dept. Chief Pledges Fight on Bias

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section A; Page 29, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 239 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11


Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng has demanded a report within 60 days on
the Agriculture Department compliance with civil rights laws, and has told
officials that their highest priority must be to fight discrimination.

Failure to correct civil rights problems ''will be viewed as a grievous weakness
in management which, in my view, no other accomplishments can offset,'' he said
Tuesday in a memorandum to assistant secretaries and heads of department
agencies.

Mr. Lyng noted that recent charges of discrimination aimed at the department
were being investigated and corrective action would be taken, if necessary. The
department has often faced charges of discrimination in delivering services to
farmers who were members of minority groups and in dealings with minority
employees.

At his news conference tonight, President Reagan said he felt strongly that
there should be no discrimination in the department.

''I don't want any hint or sign in our Administration that there is any kind of
discrimination of that kind,'' he said, ''I'm going to ride herd on this, but I
have great confidence in the Secretary of Agriculture.''

Mr. Lyng directed Deputy Secretary Peter Myers and John Franke, assistant
secretary for administration, to provide periodic assessments of civil rights
compliance and recommendations that would be communicated to officials for
immediate action. He said the first report is due in 60 days.

JAMES BOND SETS SCENE AS HOG FIGURES EMERGE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 5, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 788 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 22


A policeman, girdled with weapons, hovers by a door marked ''Lockup in
Progress.'' Barricaded behind the metal door is a warren of offices, many marked
''Restricted Area.'' The light and air are bad because all the windows are
darkened with special blackout shades and sealed with metal strips. A technician
wanders though the maze of corridors, electronically sweeping the rooms for
unfriendly bugs.

The United States Department of Agriculture is preparing to release its
quarterly report on the nation's hog and pig inventories. Some people might
question the need for such precautions as using eavesdrop-proof computers to
count American hogs and pigs (52 million this year), but the economists and
former farmers at the agency's Crop Reporting Board are very serious.
(''Civilization is built on the six grains,'' said Russell Forte, an agency
spokesman.)

This is big business, after all. A commodities speculator who got a preview of
the agency's confidential inventory data before they became public could
conceivably do some wise shopping in the financial marketplace.

Recalling the incident as though it happened yesterday, Wilbert H.  Walther,
chairman of the Crop Reporting Board, said that a security breach occurred in
1905. It seems that a high-ranking member of the board yanked his window shade
up and down to signal his brokers what was happening in cotton. He got caught.

Besides facing the omnipresent ''Spy versus Spy'' atmosphere in the agency,
employees are officially reminded of their responsibilities every few years when
they renew a secrecy pledge. The pledge pointedly mentions that violators face
fines and imprisonment.

Speaking of imprisonment, the 300 employees of the Statistical Reporting Service
are locked into their offices all during the daylong process in which farm data
from 50 states is, for the first time, collated into a single report and printed
on two small, presumably bug-resistant, presses in the ''secure area.''

''Occasionally we lock up an outsider by mistake,'' said Mr.  Walther, a former
farmer from Texas, who wears silver cowboy boots.  ''Last year, a Coca Cola
salesman was in a rest room when the lockup started, and we made him spend the
whole day with us even though he was double parked,'' the chairman added.

About three times a month, the agency pulls its shades to prepare statistical
reports on everything from apple inventories to wheat production. The reports
are of varying importance to traders, farmers and exporters. The agency's report
on eggs, chickens and turkeys - goods that are not traded on the commodities
market - do not stir as much emotion as reports on grain production, which
underpins the entire farm world.

The Government started reporting farming statistics in the 1920's, according to
the department's historian, Wayne D. Rasmussen. The idea of the reports, he
added, was to help farmers plan production by informing them about national
inventories and production.

Today, the country's hog farmers learned that their 581,000 peers were planning
to farrow (i.e., breed) 11 percent fewer sows than last year and that the number
of lightweight pigs was down 18 percent - two factors pointing to reduced supply
this fall and possibly higher prices. Pig and hog farmers, who are doing pretty
well because the cost of feed grain is down, are called pig and hog farmers
because there is no widely used definition of either term, the chairman said.

Another relatively routine report on grain inventories, showing much higher
supplies than last year, was also released today.  But no matter how
insignificant the document, once it emerges from a lockup, the statistics are
rolled out in best agency style.  Today, the members of the press, including
representatives from Commodity News Service and Pro Farmer, a news and advice
service for farmers, were given an armed escort into the Release Room. The seven
reporters were permitted to dial their home offices and then, with the lines of
communication left open, they were asked to retreat to the center of the Release
Room and stand on a specially shaded area of carpet.

A moment before 3 P.M., the time the commodities markets close, Mr. Walther
placed copies of the hog and pig report face down next to each telephone. When
the clock struck three, the reporters, showing various degrees of composure,
went to their telephones and immediately began telling their editors such facts
as that the average sow produced a 7.26-pig litter this spring.

U.S., Seeing Threat of Disease, Halts Trade in Argentine Beef

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

SECTION: Section A; Page 6; Column 4; Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 474 words

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Aug. 11


The United States and Argentina have temporarily halted trade in Argentine beef
because of concerns of a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease here.

In statements today, the two governments called the step precautionary and said
the disease did not pose a long-term threat to the growing trade in one of
Argentina's most popular exports. Nevertheless, the halt in shipments is more
bad news for President Fernando de la Rua in his lagging efforts to pry
Argentina out of a two-year recession.

Argentina's quota of beef sales to the United States is 20,000 tons a year and
it is lobbying hard to increase the quota. The United States refused fresh
Argentine beef until 1997, when the Agriculture Department lifted a ban linked
to recurrent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the early part of the
century.

Argentine beef has become a gastronomic fashion in much of the United States.
Fed on grass rather than corn and allowed to roam on the pampas, Argentine
cattle produce beef that is lean and tasty, if slightly chewy.

Nine days ago, Argentine officials found antibodies for foot-and-mouth disease
in 10 head of cattle smuggled from neighboring Paraguay. Foot-and-mouth, rarely
suffered by humans although they can be carriers, is a virus characterized by
fever, weight loss and mouth blisters. As a precaution, the Argentine government
ordered the slaughter of 3,000 head of cattle in northern Formosa, Corrientes
and Entre Rios Provinces and suspended most exports of fresh beef, not only to
the United States, but also to Canada, Venezuela, Central America and the
Caribbean.

The government said the cattle with the antibodies were not actually sick.

After Argentina took action, the United States Department of Agriculture put a
"temporary hold" on fresh, chilled or frozen Argentine beef. Cooked and canned
beef imports will still be allowed in.

Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said today that his government took
Washington's action in stride. "There is no inclination on the part of the
United States to prohibit the import of Argentine beef," Mr. Berhongaray said.
"This was a move that was anticipated."

In a brief statement today, the American Embassy praised Argentina for taking
prompt action. "As soon as this situation is resolved," the statement read,
"exports of fresh beef will be able to resume."

As the fourth largest beef exporter, Argentina expected to sell 350,000 tons of
beef products abroad this year. Three months ago, international monitors
declared Argentine beef free of foot-and-mouth disease, a finding that officials
had hoped would help them increase exports.

"Argentina made the decision to cease meat exports until the sanitary situation
is resolved," the Argentine Agriculture Department said in a statement that
predicted a resolution of the problem in a week.

AMERICA EASES BSE RESTRICTIONS ON CANADA

SECTION: FARMING LIFE; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 285 words


AGRICULTURE Secretary Ann M Veneman said that, after a thorough scientific
analysis, the United States Department of Agriculture would begin accepting
applications for import permits for certain ruminant derived products from
Canada.

"We have a long history of safeguards in place to prevent the introduction of
BSE in the United States, and the continued protection of the US food supply is
our top priority," Ms Veneman said.

"Our experts have thoroughly reviewed the scientific evidence and determined
that the risk to public health is extremely low."

On May 20, 2003, Secretary Veneman temporarily halted imports of live ruminants
and most ruminant products from Canada after a cow in Alberta was found to have
BSE.

Meanwhile, a cheap new test can distinguish cattle infected with or vaccinated
against Foot-and-Mouth Disease, according to the science journal, Nature
Science.

The fast, low-tech lab test is said to reliably sort the two groups (infected or
vaccinated).

"It could easily be made into a strip test - like a dipstick," said Foot-
and-Mouth expert David Paton, of the Institute for Animal Health in Pirbright,

Animals could then be checked quickly in the field.

Called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or Elisa, the test correctly
recognised blood samples from 50 infected and 1,000 vaccinated cows. It also
distinguished different strains of the Foot-and-Mouth virus.

But epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse, of the University of Edinburgh, questions if
the test is sensitive enough. "It's possible that you'd be using this test on
millions of animals," he says. "Even if it's 99.9 per cent effective, that means
you could misdiagnose a lot of them."

Washington: New USDA Commitments to Help Build Up Next Generation of Farmers and
Ranchers

LENGTH: 594  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency has
issued the following news release:





 USDA prioritized $5.6 billion over the next two years within USDA programs and
services that serve new and beginning farmers and ranchers. A new, tailored web
tool was designed to connect burgeoning farm entrepreneurs with programs and
resources available to help them get started.





 The new web tool is available at www.usda.gov/newfarmers. The site was designed
based on feedback from new and beginning farmers and ranchers around the
country, who cited unfamiliarity with programs and resources as a challenge to
starting and expanding their operations. The site features advice and guidance
on everything a new farm business owner needs to know, from writing a business
plan, to obtaining a loan to grow their business, to filing taxes as a new small
business owner. By answering a series of questions about their operation,
farmers can use the site's Discovery Tool to build a personalized set of
recommendations of USDA programs and services that may meet their needs.



 Using the new web tool and other outreach activities, and operating within its
existing resources, USDA has set a new goal of increasing beginning farmer and
rancher participation by an additional 6.6 percent across key USDA programs,
which were established or strengthened by the 2014 Farm Bill, for a total
investment value of approximately $5.6 billion. Programs were targeted for
expanded outreach and commitment based on their impact on expanding opportunity
for new and beginning farmers and ranchers, including starting or expanding an
operation, developing new markets, supporting more effective farming and
conservation practices, and having access to relevant training and education
opportunities. USDA will provide quarterly updates on its progress towards
meeting its goal. A full explanation of the investment targets, benchmarks and
outcomes is available at: BFR-Commitment-Factsheet.



 As the average age of the American farmer now exceeds 58 years, and data shows
that almost 10 percent of farmland in the continental United States will change
hands in the next five years, we have no time to lose in getting more new
farmers and ranchers established. Equally important is encouraging young people
to pursue careers in industries that support American agriculture. According to
an employment outlook report released by USDA's National Institute of Food and
Agriculture (NIFA) and Purdue University, one of the best fields for new college
graduates is agriculture. Nearly 60,000 high-skilled agriculture job openings
are expected annually in the United States for the next five years, yet only
35,000 graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher in agriculture related
fields are expected to be available to fill them. The report also shows that
women make up more than half of the food, agriculture, renewable natural
resources, and environment higher education graduates in the United States. USDA
recently released a series of fact sheets showcasing the impact of women in
agriculture nationwide.



 The announcement builds on USDA's ongoing work to engage its resources to
inspire a strong next generation of farmers and ranchers by improving access to
land and capital; building market opportunities; extending conservation
opportunities; offering appropriate risk management tools; and increasing
outreach and technical support.

Bill exempts wildlife officers from bear-killing ban

BYLINE: UNDER THE DOME,

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A-08

LENGTH: 363 words


Wildlife officials and certain other government agents would  be exempt from a
ban on killing black bears during spring and  summer under a compromise given
tentative approval Wednesday by  the Senate. House Bill 1221 also exempts any
person who kills a  black bear in defense of life or property.

The bill is a compromise on a plan that would have allowed  wildlife officials
to issue licenses for hunting problem bears in  the summer. Wildlife officers
said the bill was needed to prevent  people from ignoring hunting restrictions
and firing on bears from  their porches.

Under the compromise, agents from the Division of Wildlife or  the U.S.
Department of Agriculture would be exempted.Pledge  proposal dies

The Senate Judiciary Committee killed a bill Wednesday that  would have required
students and teachers at public schools to  start each school day by reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.

House Bill 1332, by Sen. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Fort Morgan, was  nearly identical
to a bill killed in a Senate committee earlier  this session. The vote was 4-1
to kill the measure, with just one  Republican senator present. Supporters said
some schools no longer  require the Pledge of Allegiance and said a daily
recitation would  show unity and patriotism.

Opponents cited a 1943 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said  requiring the pledge
could infringe on free-speech rights.

Changing face of billboards

The Senate gave preliminary approval Wednesday to a bill that  would allow
highway billboards that change faces. House Bill 1269,  co-sponsored by Sen. Ron
May, R-Colorado Springs, also would  enable the Colorado Department of
Transportation to relocate  billboards when a highway is widened rather than
paying the sign  owners and property owner thousands just to destroy the signs.

May said that 'trivision' billboard advertising would mean  more money for local
governments because it would triple the  number of ads on a billboard, each of
which would have to pay a  fee to the local government. The signs also change
faces so  slowly, May said, that they won't pose a hazard to motorists.

Brazilian soya steals market from USA

SECTION: Front Page

LENGTH: 159 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo, 12/14/01

The world's biggest soybean producer, the United States, is losing international
market share, especially to Brazil and Argentina. The Americans dominated more
than half the world market for the 1999/00 crop, with 57% of all exports. The
outlook, for the moment, is that they will account for 46% of export sales of
the 2001/02 crop, according to the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA). During this same period, increased agressiveness by the two South
American countries showed its effect. The Brazilian market share rose from 24%
to 30%, practically one-third of the world market, while Argentina is boosting
its participation from 9% to 15%.  In the past two crops, Brazil increased its
production almost 22%, to 41.5 million metric tonnes of grain, estimated by the
USDA. Argentina production rose an expressive 35% to the current estimated 28.75
million tonnes.  (Monica Scaramuzzo, Gazeta Mercantil - Translated by James

Feeding the Hungry;
How Well Are Government Programs Doing?

Carole Sugarman, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: HEALTH; PAGE Z24; EATING RIGHT

LENGTH: 1288 words


No one knows exactly how many Americans are hungry, but it's clear that the
recession has hit shopping baskets hard. Participation has increased in
practically every feeding program administered by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. The most dramatic example is food stamps, which now help one in 10
people buy groceries every month -- the largest participation level in the
program's history.

What's more, the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that in 1991 requests for
emergency food increased by 26 percent in the nation's major cities -- the
highest increase since 1985. And a survey conducted in 1990 by Catholic
Charities USA showed that six of every 10 people who went to Catholic Charities
agencies needed emergency food or shelter, up from two of every 10 people 10
years ago.

The country's largest provider of feeding programs is the USDA, which spends $
30 billion annually on 13 different feeding programs. More than 60 percent of
the department's budget funds these programs, many of which are "entitlement,"
meaning that all those who meet the eligibility requirements are guaranteed aid
under the law.

"Federal feeding programs are one of the great success stories," said Rob
Fersch, director of the Food Research Action Center (FRAC), a consumer advocacy
group. Nevertheless, improvements are needed to reach the people who qualify,
streamline red tape and expand food stamp benefit levels, Fersch said.

Not surprisingly, there are others who disagree about the handling of some of
the programs. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said that he is "often amazed at how successful our nutrition
programs are, in spite of the administration's opposition and mismanagement" of
them.

"I think the fact that so many people are participating in the programs speaks
for itself," said Phil Shanholtzer, spokesman for the USDA's Food and Nutrition
Service.

Here is the status of the well-known and lesser-known food programs run by the
USDA:

Food stamps. A survey of 1,000 registered voters conducted in January by Vincent
Breglio, pollster for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and former polling
director for the 1988 Bush presidential campaign, found approval for the program
jumped from 61 to 81 percent when respondents were told that half of food stamp
recipients are children and that more than 80 percent of food stamp benefits go
to families with children. The poll, commissioned by Kraft/General Foods, was
released in April in conjunction with the Medford Declaration, an outline for
ending hunger endorsed by 3,000 government officials, university presidents and
corporate, union, association and religious leaders.

As of this March, 25.7 million Americans were receiving food stamps, an increase
from 22.6 million in the previous year. Many newcomers are newly unemployed.

Before it adjourns for the fall, Congress will be considering The Children's
Initiative, a bill that includes $ 3.5 billion over five years to help families
with children get more adequate benefits from the food stamp program.

Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Almost
one out of every three babies born in the U.S. is served by WIC, whose purpose
is to improve the health of pregnant and postpartum women, infants and children
up to age 5 through supplemental foods, nutrition education and access to health
services. This is not an entitlement program, meaning that it covers only as
many people as there are funds appropriated. About 55 percent of eligible women,
infants and children are served. Participation was up 8 percent from 1990 to
1991; this year, President Bush requested a $ 200 million increase in the 1992
program, below the amount advocates wanted.

The benefits of WIC are obvious. One recent study, for example, showed that
women on WIC had lower Medicaid costs for themselves and their babies than women
who didn't participate, and each dollar spent in prenatal WIC benefits was found
to be more than offset by Medicaid savings during the first two months after
birth, according to the USDA.

National School Lunch Program. More than 24 million children in more than 92,000
schools participate. About half receive a free or reduced-price lunch, and the
numbers are growing. From 1990 to 1991, the number of reduced-price lunches
increased by about 12 percent, and the number of free lunches increased by 4
percent. At the same time, full-price lunches decreased by 4 percent.

In recent years, the school lunch program has been criticized for its poor
nutritional quality. USDA recently funded a food service management institute at
the University of Mississippi whose purpose is to educate cafeteria staffs about
dietary guidelines.

School Breakfast Program. Compared to the large number of children receiving
lunch, only 4.4 million children are served breakfast in 42,000 of the nation's
schools, but participation is increasing. FRAC believes that this program is one
of the most beneficial and underused federal nutrition programs.

Summer Food Service Program. During summer vacations, children in needy areas
receive meals served by camps, colleges or state and local government
facilities. In 1981, the Reagan administration proposed its elimination, but the
program was narrowed by prohibiting private nonprofit organizations such as
churches from serving meals, said Fersch of FRAC. In 1989, Congress reinstituted
the nonprofits on a limited basis.

Child and Adult Care Food Program. This is the fastest-growing of USDA's food
assistance programs, providing funding and foods to child care centers, family
day care homes and adult day care centers.

Commodity Supplemental Food Program. A grant program to state agencies, CSFP
provides food to a population similar to WIC participants, with the inclusion of
adults over 60. Since 1984, participation has more than doubled.

Nutrition Program for the Elderly. Approximately 1 million people were served
under this program in 1991; it provides cash and surplus foods to senior citizen
centers and meals-on-wheels programs.

Special Milk Program. Children who attend schools, summer camps or child care
institutions that do not have federally supported meal programs, and
pre-kindergartners or kindergartners who attend half-day sessions, receive milk
under this program, which has been greatly reduced since the expansion of the
school lunch and breakfast programs.

Nutrition Assistance Program (Puerto Rico and Northern Marianas). This block
grant program is similar to food stamps, but eligible consumers get cash and
coupons.

Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations and the Trust Territories.
Indians living on or near a reservation who meet certain guidelines receive
monthly food packages. The USDA says foods are selected to meet the health needs
of the Indian community, which has high rates of heart disease, diabetes,
obesity and alcoholism.

Nutrition Education and Training Program (NET). This is a grant program aimed at
teaching nutrition to children, parents, educators and school food service
personnel.

Commodity Distribution to Charitable Institutions. Churches, soups kitchens,
orphanages and food banks are among recipients, but food supplies have declined
recently.

The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). It was created by Ronald Reagan
in 1981 to reduce the amount of surplus farm commodities. Since the free cheese
giveaways of the early '80s, the levels of surplus "are way down," according to
Shanholzer.

Because of increased demands for lowfat dairy products, there's a lot of excess
butterfat on the market. These days, needy households are getting a lot of free
butter.

US sheep may be infected with BSE from British feed

BYLINE: Jonathan Leake Science Editor

SECTION: Home news

LENGTH: 302 words


VETS have found the first evidence that sheep could have become infected with
BSE. Three flocks in America were this weekend being taken to laboratories for
slaughter and examination after tests showed signs of the disease.

The flocks of Friesian milking sheep were imported from Europe to Vermont within
the past four years. Checks have shown that their parent flocks had eaten
British-bought feed that was likely to contain material from BSE infected cows.

Linda Detwiler, the United States Department of Agriculture vet responsible for
monitoring BSE and related diseases in America, said they would be taken to Plum
Island near New York, the country's most secure biological facility.

"Four sheep were confirmed positive on July 10 for a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) - the class of diseases that includes BSE. Tests for
scrapie, the TSE normally found in sheep, have proved negative so there is a
distinct possibility they have BSE," she said.

Scientists know that, under laboratory conditions, sheep can catch BSE from
eating infected bovine material. However, there has never been any clear
evidence of this happening on farms. Some experts believe, however, that sheep
with BSE would have been misdiagnosed as suffering from scrapie, which has
identical symptoms.

Four tests were used on the Vermont sheep. The first looked at the brains of
culled animals and found clear signs of the lesions seen in sheep with BSE like
diseases.

Samples were sent to other scientists. One said: "It could be a new form of
scrapie, or BSE."

The evidence in favour of BSE is strengthened by the animals' European parent
flocks having been certified free of scrapie.

Detwiler said it would take a year for further tests to confirm whether or not
the sheep have BSE.

"These funds were designed with the buy-and-hold investor in mind, and we want
to demonstrate that we also view these as long-term investments." stated John
Hyland, USCF's Chief Investment Officer. "We believe this will be an effective
longer-term strategy to continue to grow our assets."

United States Commodity Index fund tracks a broad basket of commodity futures
contracts. USCI is used by investors seeking exposure to the returns of a
portfolio of commodities futures contracts. United States Copper Index Fund is
used by investors who seek exposure to a portfolio of copper futures contracts.

U.S. revises meat labeling rules

BYLINE: Peter Whoriskey

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 618 words


New rules for U.S. meatpackers will require labeling that tells consumers where
the animal was born, raised and slaughtered.

Sounds simple.

But the regulations, posted Friday by the Department of Agriculture, are the
latest move in a trade dispute that has pitted U.S. consumer groups, which favor
the labels, against free-trade advocates, who say the regulations are biased
against cattle and pork from Canada and Mexico.

Nor are the regulations likely to be the last word in the international
controversy, which seems destined to wind up - again - before the World Trade
Organization, which has previously ruled that U.S. labeling regulations
discriminated against Canadian and Mexican livestock.

The dispute over meat labeling is one of a handful in recent years in which U.S.
efforts to regulate food and other products have been rejected by the WTO. The
WTO has ruled against U.S. "dolphin-safe" tuna labels and weighed in as well
against a ban on clove-flavored cigarettes.

"The big lesson for American consumers is that the WTO has invaded aspects of
our lives that have nothing to do with trade," said Lori Wallach, director of
Public Citizen's group on trade issues. "They have come to your dinner table.
Depending on what the WTO does, either consumers will be provided with important
information, or the U.S. may face trade sanctions."

The dispute over meat labeling promises to continue.

While U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says the new rules on meat labeling
will bring the United States "into compliance" with trade obligations, Canada
disagrees and Mexico has already complained about the regulations.

"Canada is extremely disappointed with the regulatory changes put forward by the
United States," according to a statement from the Canadian trade and agriculture
ministers, Ed Fast and Gerry Ritz. "These changes will increase discrimination
against Canadian cattle and hogs and increase damages to industry on both sides
of the border."

"Mexico regrets that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has chosen to propose
amendments to the regulations that would exacerbate the adverse impact [of the
labeling program] on bilateral trade," Mexican trade and agriculture ministers
Kenneth Smith Ramos and Carlos Vazquez Ochoa wrote.

The meat labeling dispute dates back to March 2009, when the United States
required that meat be labeled with its country of origin - without specifying,
as the new rules do, where the animal was born, raised and slaughtered.

Canada and Mexico objected to those rules, arguing that the hassles of tracking
each animal's nationality prompted slaughterhouses to prefer animals that had
been born and raised in the United States. This created a bias against foreign
livestock, they argued.

Canada and Mexico took their concerns to the World Trade Organization, which
ruled against the United States in June.

By making the labeling more specific, the United States appears to be addressing
the WTO's concern that the record keeping required under the previous rules was
too onerous given the meager amount of information it gave consumers. The new
rules, which cite more information, better justify the record keeping required,
at least according to the American view.

"The requirement will provide consumers with more specific information on which
to base their purchasing decisions without imposing any additional recordkeeping
requirements on industry," the USDA's announcement said.

The United States estimates that more than 2,800 livestock processing and
slaughtering companies, 38 chicken processing companies and about 4,300
retailers will be affected by the new rules. Officials estimated the cost of
implementing the rules at $33 million.

GAZETA: Lowest US soybean stock in 27 years

SECTION: Front Page

LENGTH: 123 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo, 11/13/2003

Reduced US soybean production and increased world demand have reduced American
stockpiles to the lowest levels since 1976. The stocks, of 3.4 million tons, are
not enough even for the consumption of one month in the United States. The data
was disclosed yesterday by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and refers to the world agriculture market.  The low stocks are the result of
two factors. The Americans, who were expecting a record harvest of 80 million
tons, will collect the smallest crop since 1996, only 66.73 million tons. But
the international appetite remains veracious. China should import record volumes
from this crop, some 22 million tons.  (Lucia Kassai, Gazeta Mercantil -

EC BEATS OUT US IN FARM EXPORTS

BYLINE: (AP)

SECTION: EXPORTS, Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 365 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The European Community with relative suddenness has replaced the United States
as the world's leading exporter of farm products, wiping out a 2-to-1 lead
enjoyed by U.S. farmers only a decade ago.

A new analysis by the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited monetary policy,
exchange rates and the expansion of the European trading bloc from 10 countries
o 12 as key factors in this shift.

"EC exports, buoyed initially by exchange rates that made EC products relatively
less expensive, started to rebound as the dollar neared its peak value during
1984 and 1985. As the dollar weakened and world prices fell, export subsidies
have permitted increased EC export sales at prices far below internal support
levels," the report said.

The report, "A Comparison of Agriculture in the United States and the European
Community," was prepared by the department's Economic Research Service.
Officials said it is designed to help policy-makers as they explore options for
protecting farm incomes on both sides of the Atlantic while cutting back on
price and income supports.

The report said the 12 EC nations exported $ 28.1 billion worth of farm
commodities last year, compared with $ 26.1 billion for the United States.

Other comparisons cited by the report a re:

* Average sizes of U.S. farms are 438 acres, compared with 42 acres in Europe.

* Dairy, livestock and grains account for the bulk of EC farm production,
although fruits, vegetables and oilseeds are becoming more important.

* Beef and veal production is more important to U.S. livestock producers, while
dairy is more important in Europe. Coarse grains such as corn make up a larger
share of U.S. production, while wheat is more important to the European farmer.

* Agricultural price supports in the EC are "paid for through high consumer
prices as well as government payments to store surpluses and subsidize exports
and processing." Producers are protected from international competitors by a
variable levy, a system of import taxes.

* In the United States, farmers get "deficiency" payments or subsidies to
support incomes, meaning that consumer prices are held down from what they
otherwise might be.

Soybean, corn futures slip lower

BYLINE: Farm Market News

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT & FINANCE; Pg. 20, FARM COMMODITIES

LENGTH: 366 words

DATELINE: Winnipeg, Man.


The advancing harvest and estimates that the U.S. Agriculture Department will
report higher than anticipated output pushed Chicago Board of Trade soybean and
corn futures lower yesterday.

Private estimates, including the 1.847-billion bushel production figure for U.S.
soybeans from Sparks Companies, have led to expectations the U.S. government
will raise its output as more and more growing areas are said to be reporting
unexpectedly high yields after a drier than normal summer.

In addition, news of rain benefitting the Brazilian soybean crop further
undermined CBOT soybean prices.

CBOT soybeans settled US3 3/4 cents to US6 1/4 cents a bushel lower. Featured
January was down US6 cents at US$5.87 1/4.

Friday's lower than anticipated feed grain allocation of U.S. export credits for
the Soviet Union helped push nearby CBOT corn futures lower. Deferred prices,
however, found light support from hope that there will be news later this week
about further credits of direct aid to the U.S.S.R. from the U.S.

CBOT corn closed US1 cents higher to US1 1/2 cents lower. Most active March
finished at US$2.60 1/4, down US1 1/2 cents.

Word from U.S. exporters that China has bid for one million tonnes of subsidized
U.S. wheat encouraged buying in the CBOT wheat pit. Futures ended US 3/4 cents
lower to US2 1/2 cents higher. Most sought after December closed at US$3.46 1/4
a bushel, up US2 1/4 cents.

Forecasts calling for continued dry conditions for the U.S. winter wheat crop
also helped rally CBOT wheat values.

Canola values at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange settled 60 cents to $1.40 a
tonne lower under the weight of declines in CBOT soybeans. Featured January
ended at $284.40, down $1.40.

The losses in canola, however, were limited by floor trader talk about the
possibility of another week of exceptionally high canola buying by the Japanese,
with exporters estimating amounts at 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes. This would be
10,000 tonnes above normal levels.

Flaxseed at the WCE settled 30 cents to $1.80 higher with featured December
ending at $204.20, up $1.80. Good demand from the commercial sector accounted
for the upward movement.

Acreage Curb May Ease

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 22, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 221 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11


The drought may force the Government to ease crop acreage controls next year to
help the United States rebuild its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng said today.

But the United States ''should be able to bounce back'' from this year's drought
losses in 1989, he said in prepared remarks.

Mr. Lyng said that a larger portion of the United States has suffered from some
degree of drought in May and June than at any point since records began in 1895.

Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United States was in the
''severe to extreme'' drought category, he said.

''Because of the large early-season area now experiencing drought in the United
States, 1988 appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the
drought-affected areas of the 1930's and 1950's,'' Mr. Lyng said.

Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply of food grains
and livestock feed grains so that the United States ''will be able to take care
of our domestic needs and our export demand,'' he said.

Mr. Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be somewhat less
than previously estimated because prices are much higher.

''But it is important to note that we will have no shortages, that we will still
be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers,'' he said.

For our food, animals, selves

BYLINE: Richard French

SECTION: COMMENTARY; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 597 words


COLUMN: AS I SEE IT

It is easy to take the safety of our food for granted. The United States has
long been touted as having the cheapest, safest food supply in the world, thanks
to an extensive system of interlocking safeguards and the close interaction of
producers, businesses, and federal and state partners.

Just recently, the work of this network has produced good news for consumers in
this country. According to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the World
Organization for Animal Health has reduced the United States' risk
classification for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, better known as mad cow
disease, to negligible. Vilsack credited the cooperation between industry and
government with the practical elimination of this hazard; "This is a significant
achievement for the United States, American beef producers and businesses, and
federal and state partners," he said, citing the interlocking safeguards "that
protect our public and animal health."

Now the U.S. Department of Agriculture is planning to strengthen the safeguards
that depend on that cooperation by building a nationwide network of laboratories
that work to secure our food safety and maintain the best animal health and
welfare in the world. After a decade of work, the National Animal Health
Laboratory Network is close to becoming reality. The result will be a long-term
investment in a vital part of our lives: our food. The concept is supported by
the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, which believes
a more robust laboratory network will protect America's livestock industries and
food supply from the threat of emerging and foreign diseases.

It is critically important for interested parties and consumers - and in this
matter, we are all interested parties and consumers - to provide comments both
in support of the USDA's concept paper, as well as to offer suggestions or
constructive criticism.

Clearly, animal diseases increasingly affect international trade, food safety,
and human health. The care and welfare of animals raised for food is an
international issue, and has become more so as our increasingly global
marketplace shares products and technologies. As the mad cow scares in Great
Britain and elsewhere have demonstrated, animal health monitoring is essential
for maintaining consumer confidence. Diseases that affect certain types of
livestock, but not humans, can cause catastrophic economic losses to U.S.
producers, and can cause shortages and drive up the prices of meats and other
animal products.

The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and affiliated
laboratories in the NAHLN form the first line of defense in monitoring and
preventing diseases from affecting the U.S. food supply, where they could have
an impact on the human population. As an example, APHIS regulates live animal
imports to ensure that livestock diseases - including bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine flu, and avian flu - are not
introduced to domestic animals or humans.

America's Endangered Honeybees

SECTION: Section A; Page 26; Column 1; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 582 words


The American wild honeybee virtually died out last winter and, in some states,
80 percent of commercial honeybee colonies died out as well. Gardeners
accustomed to the familiar buzz heard instead the sound of silence. With no bees
to bring pollen from plant to plant, gardeners raised fewer apples, cucumbers
and zucchini, and what did grow was puny. As cold weather bears down again, bees
are once again endangered. The American honeybee faces the worst threat in its
history, one with potential consequences for the one-third of the national diet
that relies, directly or indirectly, on honeybees for pollination.

The chief culprits are two mites that invaded the United States in the
mid-1980's. The tracheal mite, first seen here in 1984, lives in the insect's
breathing tubes. It kills a whole bee colony at once. The Varroa mite, which
came three years later, sucks the bees' blood and causes an early death. They
have spread to most states and are particularly deadly in places with long, cold
winters. Last winter more than half the commercial honeybees in New York and
Pennsylvania died.

The bee disaster has not yet produced a crop disaster. Diligent beekeeping can
help more commercially raised bees survive this winter. Beekeepers are learning
to kill the Varroa mites by hanging chemical strips in the hives twice a year.
The tracheal mite, which has weakened in the last few years, can be killed with
menthol crystals. Even in states that lost their honeybees, large agricultural
producers last summer rented colonies from less affected states. Michigan apple
growers, for example, trucked bees up from Florida. The mites have raised the
rental price of a bee colony, but pollination is a small part of a crop's cost
-- such a small part that fruit and vegetable shoppers have probably not noticed
any significant effect on consumer prices.

While the Varroa mite may follow the tracheal mite and become more benign, it
also could take a sinister route, developing resistance to the one mitocide that
beekeepers in the United States can use to kill it. This has already happened in
Italy. Researchers are working on new mitocides. But this is not the best
long-term solution. They must find insects that can replace the honeybee, which
does 80 percent of insect pollinating. Or they must develop new strains of bees
that the mites cannot kill. Even if the perfect bee appeared tomorrow, it would
take years to spread the strain throughout the United States.

Because it has not yet greatly hurt commercial agriculture, the threat to the
honeybee has not generated much publicity or needed research funds. About a
dozen researchers in the United States are working on the problem, in an
Agriculture Department-funded lab and at several universities. While Agriculture
Department officials say the researchers have the resources they need, the
researchers disagree. They say they cannot pay for needed trips to Italy or
Russia to examine resistant strains of honeybees. Researchers have also received
some grants of a few thousand dollars from beekeepers' groups, California's
Almond Board and state agriculture departments.

The money crunch betrays short-term thinking on the part of both the Agriculture
Department and commercial fruit and vegetable producers. Bee researchers say
$100,000 would make a lot of difference. This is not an excessive sum to save
the honeybees from declining further and possibly taking with them much of what
American farmers grow.

Blumenthal, DeLauro Urge United States Department Of Agriculture To Strengthen
Department's Ability To Reduce Public Health Risks Posed By Antibiotic-Resistant
Salmonella Pathogen

LENGTH: 889  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the House of Representative Rosa Delauro, U.S Government has issued
the following news release:

Today, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Rosa
DeLauro (D-Conn.) wrote to Secretary Tom Vilsack at the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) to urge him to help reduce the public health threat posed
by Salmonella by declaring the four most virulent strains of antibiotic
resistant (ABR) Salmonella as 'adulterants'. By doing so, the USDA would be
provided the needed authority to quickly respond to public health emergencies
and stop contaminated products from being sold to consumers which will help
combat outbreaks that have become increasingly more common, as highlighted in a
recent article by the The New Yorker.

The Honorable Tom Vilsack
Secretary of Agriculture
United States Department of Agriculture
1400 Independence Avenue, SW
Washington, DC 20250

Dear Secretary Vilsack:

As you know, Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness.
It is responsible for more hospitalizations and deaths than any other foodborne
pathogen.  Every year, Salmonella is estimated to cause 1.2 million illnesses in
the United States, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths.  According to
the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) own reports, 50% of ground
chicken  and 26% of cut-up chicken  sampled test positive for Salmonella. The
level of this dangerous pathogen in our food supply is unacceptably high and we
call on the USDA to act aggressively to reduce this major public health threat.

Specifically, we write in support of a Citizen Petition urging the USDA to issue
an interpretative rulemaking declaring the four most virulent strains of
antibiotic resistant (ABR) Salmonella--Hadar, Heidelberg, Newport, and
Typhimurium--to be adulterants when found in raw meat and poultry products,
pursuant to the Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act.
Compared to other strains, ABR Salmonella is associated with an increased risk
of longer and more severe illness and hospitalization. Consumer Reports recently
found that 40% of chicken tainted with Salmonella contained a
multidrug-resistant strain.

This petition was filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)
on October 1, 2014. It is both disappointing and troubling that nearly five
months have passed and CSPI has not yet received a response from the USDA. While
we understand that the USDA has a number of competing priorities, we believe
CSPI's request for an expedited response, in accordance with 9 CFR § 392.8, is
warranted because their requested actions would significantly enhance public
health. We urge you to honor this request.

The national Salmonella Heidelburg outbreak in Foster Farms retail chicken that
spanned from March 2013 to July 2014 underscores the USDA's current inability to
stop a threat to public health and highlights why a favorable response to CSPI's
petition is urgently requested. Even though public health officials were able to
determine the source of the outbreak relatively quickly, the tainted products
remained on retail shelves for an additional 10 months. Had the USDA declared
ABR Salmonella an adulterant, the agency could have taken immediate enforcement
actions to prevent the over 350 additional cases that ensued even after the
source of the outbreak became known.

We believe it is long overdue for the USDA to declare the most dangerous strains
of Salmonella an adulterant--the same way E. coli O157:H7 was declared an
adulterant in 1994. Declaring ABR Salmonella an adulterant is not only within
the USDA's authority, as clearly outlined in the petition, but also part of
their core responsibility to protect American consumers from foodborne public
health threats. As it stands, consumers cannot trust that when ABR Salmonella is
found on a meat or poultry product, the USDA will be able to take necessary
action to remove the product from stores if the retailer or processor does not
issue a voluntary recall. American consumers are counting on the USDA to prevent
unnecessary illnesses and deaths.

We would like an update regarding the status of CSPI's petition, including when
and how you intend to respond. As supporters of CSPI's petition, we urge you to
respond favorably. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. We
sincerely hope that the USDA treats this issue with the urgency it is warranted.

USDA BEEF MOVE

SECTION: FARMING LIFE; Pg. 69

LENGTH: 109 words


FOLLOWING a risk assessment exercise, the United States Department of
Agriculture is proposing to amend its regulations so as to facilitate the
resumption in fresh beef imports from Uruguay.

Under the proposed regulations, fresh beef imports from Uruguay will be allowed
if a number of conditions are met.

At present, the main conditions appear to be concerned with the identification
of the beef and ante- and post-mortem veterinary inspections.

Uruguay has a 20,000-tonne export quota to the United States that is duty free,
but, since April 2001, only processed beef was permitted to be exported from
Uruguay to the United States.

Brazil takes soya market share from USA

SECTION: Agribusiness

LENGTH: 159 words

DATELINE: Sao Paulo, 12/14/01

The world's biggest soybean producer, the United States, is losing international
market share, especially to Brazil and Argentina. The Americans dominated more
than half the world market for the 1999/00 crop, with 57% of all exports. The
outlook, for the moment, is that they will account for 46% of export sales of
the 2001/02 crop, according to the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA). During this same period, increased agressiveness by the two South
American countries showed its effect. The Brazilian market share rose from 24%
to 30%, practically one-third of the world market, while Argentina is boosting
its participation from 9% to 15%.  In the past two crops, Brazil increased its
production almost 22%, to 41.5 million metric tonnes of grain, estimated by the
USDA. Argentina production rose an expressive 35% to the current estimated 28.75
million tonnes.  (Monica Scaramuzzo, Gazeta Mercantil - Translated by James

Yeutter says U.S. to fight for its farmers

Reuters News Agency
  AMSTERDAM
 U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the United States would
fight to win markets for its farmers if no international deal is reached
to cut agriculture subsidies.

"We will sell aggressively in world markets and will do whatever else
is necessary to protect our interests outside the United States," Mr.
Yeutter told Dutch television on Saturday at the end of a visit to the
Netherlands.

"And I suspect that protectionist forces will emerge in the U.S. in
agriculture and in the industrial sector and that may have some
implications for European exports, as well," he added.

Mr. Yeutter is to meet European Community Farm Commissioner Ray
MacSharry in Brussels today to try to break their deadlock over cutting
farm subsidies, diplomats said.

The four-year-old round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, scheduled to end in three weeks, is being held up by
disagreement over how far and fast to cut farm subsidies.

On Friday, Mr. Yeutter put the chances of reaching a deal "at much,
much less than 50-50."

The United States wants a 75 per cent cut in farm support over the next
decade and says export subsidies should be slashed by 90 per cent.

But the European Community has offered only a 30 per cent reduction in
support over the 10 years from 1986. Mr. MacSharry has said, however, that
the EC offer is better than it looks.

Mr. Yeutter was part of a high-level U.S. delegation led by Secretary
of State James Baker, which met EC Commission President Jacques Delors and
other commissioners on Friday.

Mr. Baker said intense discussions between the United States and the EC
would continue at the highest level to prevent the GATT talks collapsing.

U.S. trade representative Carla Hills yesterday met her opposite
number, EC Commissioner Frans Andriessen, to review the state of
negotiations on issues other than agriculture.

Aid eases the sting of ban on bee imports from U.S.

BYLINE: CONNIE BRYSON; SPCL

LENGTH: 465 words


BY  CONNIE BRYSON
 Special to The Globe and Mail
  A two-year extension of Agriculture Canada 's ban on bees imported from
the United States presents a serious economic threat to many Alberta
beekeepers. The initial ban was for the three months ended Dec. 31, 1987.
It will now run until Dec. 31, 1989.

They received some help last week from the provincial Government,
however, which announced $2-million in disaster assistance. It works out
to a grant of $10 for each hive.

The ban was designed to protect Canadian bees from a parasite
discovered in the United States in September, but the extension comes at a
bad time for the province's $14.6-million honey industry.

Alberta is Canada's largest honey producer. Depending on the year, its
1,500 beekeepers produce 30 to 40 per cent of the country's honey.

The ban adds to the economic woes of beekeepers who rely on imported
bees. It forces them to buy more expensive bees from more distant
countries such as New Zealand instead of more reasonably priced bees from
the United States.

But, said Paul van Westendorp, apiculturist with Alberta's Department
of Agriculture, there is a good reason for the ban - to prevent the spread
of the varroa mite into Canada.

"This mite is a deadly parasite that feeds on bee 'blood,' " he said.
"At this time, there is no varroa mite test or control registered by
Agriculture Canada."

Provincial agriculture departments are petitioning Agriculture Canada
to allow them to use a synthetic chemical called fluvalinate for surveying
and monitoring varroa mites, Mr. van Westendorp said. He cautioned that it
will be years before fluvalinate is generally available, if indeed it
proves to be effective.

Nevertheless, he is optimistic that a varroa control will eventually be
found.

The ban does not affect provinces east of the Manitoba-Ontario
boundary, where U.S. bee imports have been banned since 1984 to guard
against another bee parasite, the tracheal mite. A different arrangement
whereby bees are certified "tracheal mite-free" was worked out for Western
Canada.

The new import ban caused a furor among Alberta beekeepers. The issue
was the price of bees. California bees cost about $20 for a one-pound
package (one package is needed for each hive), while a similar package
from New Zealand costs $48.

Alberta beekeepers are divided over whether the ban is good or bad. The
line of disagreement tends to be drawn between those who keep their bees
from year to year and those who use imported bees because they kill off
their hives every fall.

About 60 per cent of the hives in Alberta are killed off each winter.
It is a common practice in the northern Peace River region, which produces
more than half of the total Alberta honey crop. These beekeepers suffer
more from the high price of imported bees than from the effects of a mite
infestation.

Rain drives grain prices down but fails to relieve U.S. drought

BYLINE: Deborah Hargreaves and Nancy Dunne Financial Times of London

SECTION: SECTION 3, MARKETS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 480 words

DATELINE: London,England


  Scattered showers quenched parts of the thirsty U.S. farm belt yesterday but
showed little sign of breaking the worst drought to strike the nation in half a
century.

Grain prices plunged across the board for the second day in a row as Chicago
traders remained hypersensitive to any change in the weather.

The drought had triggered soaring commodity prices in the futures markets, where
grains until Tuesday approached record price levels.

But these prices had already anticipated widespread damage to U.S. crops, and
traders have been quick to react to any prospects of improvement in the U.S.
harvest.

DAMAGE 'UNDERESTIMATED'

The farm lobby, however, is complaining that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
has underestimated the drought damage so far.

''If it were to rain tomorrow, you would still have a 50% reduction in harvest
on wheat,'' said Devon Woodland of the National Farmers' Organization.

''You would have a 60% harvest in corn, and you would have a 70% harvest in
soyabeans.''

Even more dramatic, he said, is the 50% reduction in hay output available for
livestock farmers, who have been the first to suffer the affects of the
disaster.

''The grass has been consumed - it's gone - and we have seen the first-wave
liquidation of cattle, and the second wave will come when we know for a fact
that there is no more rain, and there is none in the forecast,'' he said.

In view of the November presidential elections, pleas by farmers for government
assistance are falling on receptive ears in Washington.

''If you're going to have a drought, it had better be in a year divisible by
four,'' said John Baise of the American Soyabean Association.

His organization has put forward a package of relief proposals including loans
and subsidies this year to drought-stricken soybean producers and export
subsidies next year.

U.S. government surpluses of soybeans are depleting rapidly and are expected to
disappear during July.

Even before the drought, the USDA had predicted that by September farmer-owned
stocks would drop to an historically low 155 million bushels.

The American Soyabean Association is worried about expanded oilseeds production
by Brazil and Argentina in 1988-89.

To maintain its grip on its markets, it is requesting changes in the U.S. farm
program which would allow for an expansion of U.S. soybean planting next year.

PROGRAM ON HOLD

The USDA has insisted that, despite the drought, there will sufficient supplies
of grain for export this year.

But the department has quietly put on hold a controversial subsidy program aimed
at boosting grain exports.

Farmers, however, are keen to see the scheme continued.

They point to the 78 million acres of land, idle this year under set-aside and
conservation programs, which could be brought back into production next year.

Agriculture changes stance

  DEPRESSED FOREIGN markets in U.S. farm products haven't done much to help the
administration engineer its desired overhaul of American agricultural policy.

Indeed, the Agriculture Department has now backed down from earlier demands that
Congress drastically scale back federal price supports. It offered a new
legislative proposal last week which, if anything, would increase U.S. subsidies
through its complex target price and deficiency payment system.

One farm-state senator, Democrat John Melcher, says one result will be
dramatically lower world grain prices if the measure is adopted.

''World grain prices would almost be cut in half by the third or fourth year
(after adoption),'' Melcher said last week. ''Canada, Australia, the EC, and
other grain producing countries are going to be faced with the reduction in
world grain prices and they are undoubtedly going to let us know about it.''

Melcher, a veterinarian from the southeastern Montana community of Forsyth, says
the administration's new bill, along with one being worked on by the Senate
Agriculture Committee, should probably be set aside for a year and existing
legislation simply extended.

Richard Crowder, an Under Secretary of Agriculture and a leading American
official in international trade negotiations, announced his resignation today.

Mr. Crowder, Under Secretary for International Affairs and Commodities Programs,
was a central figure in the GATT talks to revise world trade and the talks to
form a free-trade zone among Mexico, the United States and Canada.

Farm trade has been a sticking point in both sets of negotiations, particularly
in the talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The GATT
talks have been stymied by differences between the United States and the
European Community over agriculture policies.

Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said today that he accepted Mr. Crowder's
resignation "with regret" and that a search is under way for his successor.

Mr. Crowder, who held the post since April 1989, said he was resigning to spend
more time with his family in Minneapolis.

Mr. Crowder's resignation leaves the Agriculture Department with vacancies in
four high-level international affairs positions that most experts said would be
difficult to fill before the November elections.

TEXT:
 [*423]

   I. Introduction


   For the last ten years, I have had the opportunity to be directly involved in
efforts to promote "sustainable agriculture" in the United States. Since 1987, I
have served on the Advisory Board for the Leopold Center for Sustainable
Agriculture located at Iowa State University, one of the leading land grant
agricultural research institutions in the United States. During that time, the
Leopold Center has awarded over $ 15 million in funds to support research,
education, and promotion of sustainable agriculture. I have also served on two
committees for the Board of Agriculture of the National Academy of Sciences
addressing issues of sustainability. In 1992, the Committee on Long Range Soil
and Water Conservation Policy published Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for
American Agriculture.  n1 The ideas proposed in that book, such as using a
watershed approach to address water quality issues and the promotion of field
buffer strips to  [*424]  reduce water pollution, have in recent years been
accepted as central features of American agricultural environmental policy.
Early in 1998, the Committee on Prospects and Opportunities for Sustainable
Management of America's Nonfederal Forests published Forested Landscapes in
Perspective.  n2 Over the last several years, I have written several law review
and journal articles addressing aspects of sustainable agriculture.  n3


   I write this Essay from that experience, with the goal of sharing reflections
on the important role which law and policy will play in promoting the
development of truly sustainable agricultural systems. Sustainable agriculture
is one of the most important developments in American agriculture in the last
half century. It has the potential to be a unifying concept that can provide the
basis for addressing both the environmental and the social needs of agriculture
in countries throughout the world. For that reason, I commend the organizers of
this Congress  n4 on selecting the issue of sustainable development as a theme
for consideration. It will be impossible for any nation or the world to progress
far on the path toward sustainable development if it does not examine
agriculture. Sustainability must start from the ground up and agriculture is the
place to begin. If food production systems and our relation to the natural
resources we use to raise food are not grounded on the principles of
sustainability, our future is in doubt.


   II. Defining the Principles of Sustainable Agriculture


   The first and perhaps most important step in promoting sustainable
agriculture is to develop a common, understandable definition of the term. By
[*425]  doing so, the goals and objectives sought to be furthered by research
and education efforts, as well as by law and policy, will become clearer. In the
United States' experience, the process of defining sustainable agriculture was a
long and sometimes acrimonious process. This was due in part to the fact that
many people and institutions in agriculture originally viewed promotion of
"sustainability" as a threat to their positions or markets. These fears over
what sustainability might mean have largely disappeared and have been replaced
by an increased acceptance of sustainability as a basis to measure both farming
practices and agricultural policies.


   Sustainable agriculture is defined in various ways, but in its simplest form,
it means developing agricultural practices which protect the environment while
preserving the economic profitability of farmers.  n5 The basis of the concept
is that no agricultural system can be successful in either the short or long
term unless it is designed to sustain the resources necessary for its operation.
n6 These resources include both physical resources, of soil, air, and water, and
also human and social resources of farm families, rural communities, and the
economic structure necessary for an agrarian system to function. By focusing on
how decisions affect the "sustainability" of agriculture, policies can be made
which incorporate a concern for the environment. More importantly, by combining
a concern for the environment with attention to the economics of farming,
sustainable agriculture offers a way to harness producers' natural concerns for
the profitability of their operations.


   One statutory definition of "sustainable agriculture" can be found in Iowa
Code

    266.39, which authorizes the Leopold Center, and that section defines the
term as: "the appropriate use of crop and livestock systems and agricultural
inputs supporting those activities which maintain economic and social viability
while preserving the high productivity and quality of Iowa's land."  n7


   For the last ten years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
has funded research specifically aimed at these issues under the Sustainable
Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program. United States federal law
defines sustainable agriculture as follows:


   [A]n integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a
site- specific application that will, over the long-term-


   (A) satisfy human food and fiber needs;


   (B) enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which
the agriculture economy depends;

     [*426]

   (C) make the most efficient use of nonrenewable resources and on-farm
resources and integrate, where appropriate, natural biological cycles and
controls;


   (D) sustain the economic viability of farm operations; and


   (E) enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole . . . .
n8


   III. To What Degree Is American Agriculture Meeting the Goal of
Sustainability?


   Opinions are mixed on whether American agriculture is making progress on
being more sustainable. Many commentators will tell you that we can do much
more, which is true. But many parts of American agriculture are doing a much
better job today than ten years ago. A combination of the federal soil
conservation laws, public concern for environmental protection, and research and
education on sustainable agriculture has led to many improvements. Farmers are
adopting soil conservation practices and are considering alternatives for
improving soil fertility and controlling pests. In that regard, the impact of
public policies such as conservation compliance and efforts to fund sustainable
agricultural research, such as the Leopold Center, have had an important impact.


   In my home state of Iowa, the results from sustainable agriculture research
on issues, such as how to reduce water pollution from the overuse of nitrogen
fertilizer, are clear. For example, the average rates of nitrogen fertilizer
used per acre in Iowa have dropped significantly in recent years without
lowering crop yields. One effect is that Iowa farmers are saving millions of
dollars in reduced fertilizer costs while also reducing the potential for excess
nitrates to enter water supplies. Another effect is that if the environmental
problems that bring attention to agriculture subside, such as public concerns
for water pollution, then there should be less need to enact regulatory
approaches that may increase the costs and restrict the freedom of choice
available to farmers.


   By merging economics and environmental stewardship, sustainable agriculture
holds great potential for the United States and other nations. First, it may
offer a way to reduce tensions between the environmental community and the farm
sector, and it can help preserve consumer confidence in the quality of our food.
In addition, it may provide a basis for justifying continued and even increased
public funding of agricultural programs, such as expanded efforts to control
water pollution and conserve soil. If farmers adopt practices to protect the
environment, the negative environmental effects creating public pressure to
regulate agriculture may decline. Law and policy will play an important role in
helping any nation develop and promote sustainable agricultural systems.
Identifying the legal tools and programs that will give life to sustainable
practices is one important  [*427]  challenge. Equally important are efforts to
identify the legal and institutional barriers, such as farm tenancy practices or
agricultural lending attitudes, that might promote practices which negatively
impact the environment and hamper the development of sustainable systems.


   IV. Lessons to Be Drawn from the U.S. Experience with Sustainable Agriculture


   Perhaps the most important insights that can be drawn from the American
experience are the following ideas on how to most effectively develop and
promote sustainable agriculture principles. First, it is important to develop
commonly understood and accepted definitions of what is meant by "sustainable"
agriculture. The role of definitions is essential, not just in helping clarify
the goals to be promoted and in gaining support for the efforts, but also in
trying to develop mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of any programs
adopted.


   Second, we must recognize that the communities affected by "sustainable"
agriculture are much broader than just the farming sector. Many groups and
institutions have an interest in and influence over agricultural policy. The
research and education sector, farm groups, input suppliers, farm lenders, and
landowners are among the important groups impacted by the type of agricultural
policies in place. They are also important players in the successful promotion
of any policy. These groups can either be allies in promoting sustainability or
barriers to its adoption. The ability to gain their involvement is partially a
function of whether they perceive that a shift to sustainable practices might
threaten them. One important development within agriculture that magnifies the
role played by these groups is the increased reliance by farmers and landowners
on paid consultants to perform certain farming practices. For example, it is
increasingly common for farmers to hire agricultural business, perhaps their own
cooperatives, to apply pesticides and fertilizers. Crop consultants are commonly
hired to conduct field surveys to determine when pest problems require
treatment. The increased use of outside expertise, not necessarily from public
agencies such as the USDA's Cooperative Extension Service,  n9 is a factor that
will determine how well any alternative farming practices identified by
sustainable research are adopted.


   Third, we must appreciate the fundamental role of education and research in
providing the basis for sustainable agriculture. The concept of sustainability
is an attractive ideal, but it will remain only an ideal unless actual practices
and policies are developed to help implement sustainability in the fields.
Farmers will not change how they produce crops in order to protect the
environment unless they have knowledge and information about how the new
practices will work and the  [*428]  effect these practices will have on their
productivity and profitability. The ability to marry the twin concerns of
respect for the environment and recognition of the need for profitability if any
economic system to survive is one of the essential features of sustainable
agriculture. That is why funding for research and education is fundamental to
the efforts to adopt sustainable farming practices. A good example is the need
to improve the testing and application of livestock wastes so that producers can
take credit for the nutrients when making later fertilizer applications.


   Fourth, it is important to identify the legal and institutional biases that
influence agricultural practices. One basic theme of sustainable agriculture is
to promote adoption of farming practices which have fewer adverse impacts on the
natural environment. Developing alternative practices that can be adopted is an
important step in this process, as is developing better awareness and acceptance
of the negative impacts common farming practices may cause. However, it is
important to recognize that the availability of an alternative and the awareness
of the current problems will not always lead to a change in how farming is
carried out. There are a variety of other influences that help determine how and
why agriculture functions. These influences include: the impact of land tenure
practices, such as short-term leases that lock producers into exploitive land
practices; the lending practices of agricultural financiers that may hinder the
adoption of alternative methods of production or crop diversification; the
attitudes of farmland owners who may desire a short-term maximization of returns
rather than longer term stewardship of the land; and governmental programs that
may encourage production of certain crops rather than more balanced systems. One
of the key challenges in developing a more sustainable agriculture is for
agricultural lawyers and policymakers to identify and work to reduce the impact
these legal and institutional barriers may present.


   Fifth, we must include within promotion of sustainable agriculture
consideration for social and human needs. While most work in sustainable
agriculture has been agronomic, it is important to recognize the important link
between the economic and social structure of agriculture and developing
sustainable agricultural systems. For any agricultural production system to be
sustainable, it cannot just deal with soil and water or price and income. The
system must also consider the farmers, their families, and the rural communities
that make up the cultural structure of an agrarian system. If an agricultural
system is to thrive, people must be in the equation because they are the actors
to whom the knowledge and advice of the research community is directed. It is
the farmers and their families who care about preserving the quality of the land
they farm and who want to build an economically viable operation through which
to accumulate wealth and acquire the financial resources necessary to live. It
is the people in an agricultural system who act as the transfer agents for
knowledge and wisdom across generations. For these reasons, most definitions of
"sustainable agriculture"  [*429]  include references to either people or the
social structure of agriculture. The Iowa definition of "sustainable agriculture
" refers to "social viability" and "appropriate use"; both clear mandates to
include a structural component in discussions of sustainability.  n10 However,
for many reasons, university and public research efforts find it difficult to
address these cultural components. Perhaps the most significant obstacle to
including questions of structure and social policy in sustainable agriculture
research is that it is impossible to address the issue without encountering
difficult "political" issues that are controversial in the agricultural
community.


   Sixth, it is important to accept the need for evolution and flexibility in
public programs promoting sustainable agriculture. One of the central lessons of
recent years in the United States is a recognition that as the public acceptance
of the importance of promoting sustainable agriculture grows, the publicly
funded programs designed to do so will evolve. Much of the effort in the United
States to limit the impact of agriculture on the environment involves paying
farmers to promote soil conservation and limit water pollution. Programs such as
the popular Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which uses ten-year contracts to
retire erodible land from production,  n11 and the Wetland Reserve Program
(WRP), which buys permanent conservation easements from farmers who restore
wetlands on formerly drained fields,  n12 are good examples of how sustainable
agriculture is being promoted at the farm level. While these programs may not be
specifically promoted as "sustainable agriculture," the direct effect of the
efforts clearly is to improve farming practices and protect environmental
resources. Over the last ten years, the CRP has evolved to become more focused
on environmental protection. The WRP was first developed in 1990 as a way to
achieve more permanent restoration of valuable wetlands. It represents the first
nationwide effort by the federal government to use conservation easements, which
involve the public purchase of property rights on farmlands, to promote
conservation. Both programs are proving to be popular with farmers and
successful at protecting water quality.


   Seventh, we must also recognize the role of natural systems as the foundation
for promoting sustainable agriculture. When reduced to its essence, sustainable
agriculture may simply mean developing farming systems that are more in harmony
with nature than the conventional practices they replace. The idea of
recognizing and working with natural systems was a fundamental principle in the
writings of Aldo Leopold, whose book A Sand County Almanac and essay The Land
Ethic have greatly influenced public officials responsible for promoting
sustainable agriculture in the United States. The wisdom of using natural
systems as a way to improve  [*430]  agriculture is being increasingly
recognized and integrated into American conservation and agricultural policies.
A prime example is the value of using a watershed approach to address water
quality. While political jurisdictions may draw lines on the map, these often do
not fitthe manner in which water moves and is used. Using natural watersheds to
create the legal jurisdictions necessary to effectively address water quality
protection issues can help promote sustainability. Similar efforts are seen in
the value of restoring wetlands, the need to preserve unique and prime
farmlands, the treatment of groundwater and surface water supplies as
interconnected, and using field buffer strips to improve water quality.


   Eighth, using the food system concept is one way to make "sustainable
agriculture" important to consumers. Today, we see increasing references to the
term "food system" in discussion of the operation of America's agricultural
sector. The term is somewhat similar to "sustainable agriculture" in that it is
new and perhaps not widely understood and appreciated. Ten years ago, it was a
term rarely heard and, like sustainable agriculture, it does not have a fixed
definition, but instead reflects the values participants bring to the discussion
as well as the context of its use. The main objective of employing a food
systems approach to consider agricultural issues is to recognize that
agricultural production is only one part of a larger process, which encompasses
an array of economic activities and policy considerations. By viewing farming
and agriculture as only parts of a multi-faceted food system, broader public
questions and the connections between "farming" and these other issues can be
made clearer. Questions relating to opportunities for local food production,
food access for the poor and hunger assistance, farmland protection, the public
understanding of agriculture, and promotion of alternative markets are all
included within a broadened "food system" focus. Employing a "food systems"
model can build on the linkages that exist in the local economy and political
system. It can also help local officials ask questions that might otherwise go
unasked, such as what are the opportunities for increasing local production of
food, should public institutions purchase more food locally, and how do land use
policies affect the long-term protection of farming? Employing the food system
as a method of inquiry is a natural evolution of our attention to sustainable
agriculture.


   V. Conclusion: How the Law Can Be Used to Promote Sustainable Agriculture


   Let me conclude by summarizing several of the important opportunities that
exist for agricultural lawyers and policymakers to promote sustainable
agriculture. First, the concept of sustainability is not a separate item in
agricultural policy debates over issues such as price, income support, and
international trade. Instead, sustainability should be the organizing theme upon
which policies are based and the standard against which their performance is
measured. Second, efforts to promote  [*431]  sustainable agriculture will be
largely dependent on information and research. If farmers can be shown
alternative methods that protect the environment, as well as the economic
viability of their operations, they will adopt them. It is vital that a
significant increase in funding be provided for research on sustainable
practices. Third, as part of the attention to sustainability, it is essential to
incorporate the social and human issues relating to the structure of agriculture
. The current drive toward industrialization of American agriculture, especially
in livestock production, may threaten much of the present structure of
agriculture that will be necessary to achieve sustainability. Of all the
contradictions in American attitudes and policies toward agriculture, the most
threatening may be the divergence between the traditional structure of
agriculture, which is best suited by attitude and ability to protect the
environment, and the structure we are putting in place through
industrialization. The issue is whether the agriculture we are building can
yield the harvest we desire.


   Finally, an important force shaping American agricultural policy and the
policies of all nations is the international dimension. The recent GATT accord
on agriculture and the development of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
brought about significant changes in federal farm programs in the United States.
While there are differences of opinion as to its impact, the GATT agricultural
agreement clearly provides the authority and opportunity for countries to
develop and fund conservation and environmental programs for agriculture.  n13
Whether the WTO will operate so as to support the promotion of sustainable
agriculture or give dominance to promoting the economic values of increased
trade at the expense of the environment is still to be determined. The recent
decision against American efforts to protect endangered species of sea turtles
during shrimp harvesting raises serious doubts about the sensitivity of the WTO
process to environmental concerns. In the United States, existing farm programs
are now the primary force for the "delivery" of soil and water quality
protections. We face a critical challenge in determining how these goals will be
achieved in the future if the current programs are dismantled, as scheduled for
2002.


   There is no reason to expect public demands for environmental stewardship
will disappear just because federal farm programs disappear. If farm programs do
not exist, the public demand for environmental protection may most likely find
expression in regulatory approaches to protect soil and water. If we miss this
opportunity to take the money now used for price and income supports and convert
it into internationally acceptable environmental and conservation programs,
American agriculture will have missed the opportunity to make a rightful claim
for public support to protect the environment. We, as a nation, will also have
missed an important opportunity to promote sustainable agriculture.

Farm Policy's Problem Is Subsidies for Few

SECTION: Section 1; Page 22, Column 4; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 754 words


To the Editor:

In ''Get Fat Farmers Off Welfare'' (editorial, June 19), you characterize the
inequity and inefficiency of farm subsidies. ''A Summit Challenge: Farm
Subsidies'' (editorial, July 10) puts the issue in its proper trade context,
emphasizing the intransigence of the European Community in the Uruguay Round and
the need for comparable policy reforms in the United States.

Randolph Nodland of the National Family Farm Coalition writes (letter, July 10)
that higher, not lower price supports, plus supply control, would solve our
agricultural problems. A. L. McLeod's letter (same date) admonishes the United
States for pursuing a Gorbachev-style policy of ''controlled markets'' in
agriculture and advocates free markets for American farmers similar to those we
are advocating in Eastern Europe. These letters, representing two poles of the
debate over agricultural policy, provide much food for thought.

As self-described liberals, we do not swallow arguments ''whole-hog from the
libertarian Cato Institute's materials,'' as Mr. Nodland accuses you of doing.
One of us, Willard Cochrane, while serving as economic adviser to Secretary of
Agriculture Orville Freeman in the Kennedy Administration, designed and tried to
carry out a supply control policy such as the National Family Farm Coalition
advocates. In the end, farmers voted down the supply control approach in a 1963
referendum.

We now believe that high price supports and supply control are an untenable
policy for United States agriculture, because of the global trading environment
on which American farmers increasingly depend. To jack up domestic prices by
artificially shorting the market, the United States would need to impose border
controls to prevent cheap grain imports and would forsake its major market
position as a net exporter. This would fly in the face of our obligations under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to open world markets.

Mr. Nodland also contends that United States agricultural benefits flow
primarily to the small- to-medium-size ''family farmer,'' and that their
regressivity is ''the product of statistical manipulation.'' In a recent study,
J. D. Shaffer of Michigan State University and G. W. Whittaker of the Economic
Research Service of the Department of Agriculture found that in 1987, 60,000
farmers, representing only the top 3.6 percent of all American producers,
received 42 percent of total direct payments, averaging $75,500. The average net
worth of these farms was $745,000. The top 18 percent received 90 percent of
direct payments. And this represents only direct payments. The study concluded
that ''the direct payments significantly underestimate the total income
transfers from the Treasury and consumers to farm operators and those who own
farm land.'' We also reject the claim that these subsidies do not help cover
costs of production for most farmers. The real problem is that the subsidies
raise the costs of production because they are capitalized into land values,
restricting entry into farming by younger operators. If costs of production are
not covered by current prices, plus Government subsidies, it would be
impossible, as Mr. Nodland states, for farmers to respond to low prices by
expanding output without going out of business.

However, we also view calls for ''free market agriculture'' as naive. Government
will continue to intervene in agriculture. The question is, What kind of
intervention do we need? Not supply control and higher price and income
supports, or free market agriculture.

The task of political leaders, both farm and nonfarm, in the 1990's must be to
fashion a policy compromise in which commercial farmers are protected against
sharp and unpredictable income declines, consumers are guaranteed a safe and
bountiful supply of food, poverty in rural America is dealt with effectively and
the environment is protected. And these objectives must be achieved without
imposing trade-distorting measures at our borders. This cannot be accomplished
by continuing farm policies in which the largest share of farm income subsidies
goes to a relative few big successful farmers. This policy can only lead to
still fewer, bigger and richer farmers, and rising land values.

Breaking down the USDA budget

BYLINE: By Woods Houghton County Agriculture Agent

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 517 words


It is interesting how many political groups do not know all that the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) does. The USDA has a budget of
approximately $133 billion and various special interest groups think this is all
for farm subsidies. USDA has a lot of different missions.

What is included in the Nutritition Assistance which is 67 percent of the USDA
budget outlays. This includes programs such as food stamps, WIC, school lunch
and breakfast programs, which serve 45 million meals each day for children of
low income families.

Many people do not realize that the United States Forest Service is an agency of
USDA.

Farm and commodity program is 17 percent of the total outlay for USDA. This
includes conservation insenatives, as well commodity programs to help stabalize
the market. The last 9 percent is others. This includes Rural Development Funds
(the old farm home administration programs), These are program to help rural
communities develop, it funds such item as wastewater treatment plants,
community drink water treatment and supply, community recreation centers, rural
utilities and a host of other items including many home loans.

Others also include the Agriculture Research Service, which includes not only
direct ARS research centers but also land grant colleges such as NMSU experiment
station and agriculture research. This also includes the federal portion of the
Cooperative Extension Services, county agent, these are also know as Smith
Leaver funds. This other also includes food safety programs such as meat
inspectors, customs inspectors for agriculture products, Animal Plant and Health
Ispection Service for livestock and other animals coming into the United States.

If you really want to know where it is all spent go to
http://www.obpa.usda.gov/budsum/FY10budsum.pdf

About $9,289 million out of the $32 billion actually goes as direct payments to
farms. This includes disaster payments, conservation cost share and what special
interests groups are calling farm subsidies. These direct payments go to nearly
1.9 million farms, or an average of $4,889 per farm. The 2010 budget included
phase out of direct payments for large farms. The European Union pays out in
similar direct farm payments 181.7 billion Euros or $249 billion or
approximately $10,000 per farm. Agriculture becomes more and more a world
market. United State agriculture producers need a level playing field to
compete. The US agriculture exports increased from 2009 to 2010 16 percent and
totaled $90 trillion according to USDA, US Chamber of Commerce reports. That is
a good return on investment. As we go through this budget cycle and many groups
are pointing to the USDA budget, it is important to know what that budget really
is and how it is used.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10


The Agriculture Department said today that 1988 winter wheat production is
estimated at 1.62 billion bushels, up 4 percent from last year's harvest of 1.56
billion bushels. Officials said the average yield, based on indications as of
May 1, was estimated at 40.7 bushels an acre, compared with last year's 39.8
bushels. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer.
It makes up about three-fourths of total United States wheat production.

No hint when ban on beef will lift, U.S. says

BYLINE: PAUL KORING and GRAEME SMITH

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 710 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON and WINNIPEG


Canadian beef is safe, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said yesterday,
but she gave no hint of when - if ever - the U.S. ban on imports might be lifted
on Canadian beef and cattle.

"I'm not in a position to give you any time frame," Ms. Veneman said after
meeting with her Japanese counterpart Yoshiyuki Kamei. "There are a lot of
complicating factors."

She did, however, say that Canadian beef is not harmful.

"There's no reason to believe that there is any food safety risk with Canadian
beef."

Japan has threatened to ban U.S. beef imports on Sept. 1 unless Washington
certifies that its exports are completely free of Canadian beef. Japan is the
largest importer of U.S. beef, and Washington is keenly aware of the importance
of not putting that market at risk.

Mr. Kamei, who is Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister in Japan, will
arrive tomorrow in Ottawa to meet with Canadian officials.

Ms. Veneman praised Canada for the way it has handled the mad-cow crisis,
sparked in May by the discovery of a single case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy in Alberta, and said beef from Canada is safe.

But she gave no glimmer of hope that any lifting of the U.S. ban is imminent.

In fact, Washington has never lifted a ban on imports from any country that has
suffered an outbreak of BSE.

However, the Agricultural Secretary said she realizes there are "economic
consequences in both" Canada and the United States resulting from the crisis.

Most of those consequences are felt north of the 49th parallel. While the closed
border is costing Canadian producers an estimated $20-million daily, Canadian
beef exports represented less than 4 per cent of the U.S. market, and the
industry in the United States is largely unaffected.

A steady stream of Canadian politicians has failed to sway the Bush
administration into lifting the U.S. ban, and threats of retaliation against
U.S. beef sound hollow.

"We need to get this thing done in days, not weeks," said Rick Casson, an
Alliance MP from Lethbridge, Alta., who met yesterday with several congressmen.

"We know the desperation that's beginning to seep into that industry. And we
want to relay that message - make sure that everybody down here realizes how
desperate it is."

In Winnipeg, federal and provincial agriculture ministers met yesterday and
threatened to overhaul Canada's meat-safety system with or without co-operation
from the United States, in a move that some ministers described as a pressure
tactic to open the U.S. border.

Ministers quickly agreed to a new policy calling for the removal from the food
chain of brains, spinal cords and other cattle parts linked to BSE.

Agriculture officials on both sides of the border had been hoping to make such
improvements together, Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said. But the
U.S. decision to continue to ban Canadian beef, in place ever since the May 20
discovery of the infected animal, means Canada must be prepared to act alone,
Mr. Vanclief said.

"We certainly would like to move in that regard in conjunction with the United
States," he said. "However, we had the cow in North America and this is a human
health issue and we will be moving on that in the very near future."

Ontario Health Minister Helen Johns said she hopes the United States will get
the message.

"I think they'll see that if we change our situation too much, it will cause
problems for them," Ms. Johns said.

Food-safety regulations for Canadian and U.S. beef are now almost identical,
said Ted Haney, president of the Canadian Beef Export Federation. If Canada
makes its regulations more strict than those south of the border, he said, it
could give Canadian producers an advantage over U.S. beef in places such as Asia
and Mexico. Many corporate meat buyers are also expressing a preference for more
stringent safety assurances.

The declaration that Canada could act alone isn't merely bluster, Mr. Haney
said, because Canada will be forced to expand its offshore exports if the U.S.
border remains closed.

"Rather than a trade threat, it's more of a statement of fact," Mr. Haney said,
acknowledging such action could set a new tone in the dispute: "Until now we've
been asking, explaining, representing. This is the next step."

Acrimony grows between EC, U.S.   Farm reform threatens GATT talks

BYLINE: EDWARD GREENSPON; GAM

LENGTH: 534 words

DATELINE: London ENGLAND


BY EDWARD GREENSPON European Bureau LONDON
The United States and European Community appeared to be drifting even
further apart on farm reform yesterday as officials from 97 countries
began preliminary talks in Geneva leading up to a major negotiating round
next week.

One GATT official said it is possible agriculture won't even be
discussed next week, given the intractability of the two sides. The main
antagonists in a protracted farm trade war are waging "quite a battle" in
the runup to next week's meeting, he said.

The mood in Geneva, he said, has turned "pretty gloomy."

The United States apparently accused the EC in private meetings of
backtracking on undertakings given at the recent summit of the major
industrialized nations in Houston. The EC, in turn, was saying the United
States is trying to push it beyond the wording agreed to in the final
communique.

The latest dispute means that the required consensus might not be
achieved to table a paper on agriculture prepared by Aart de Zeeuw, the
Dutch chairman of the agriculture group.

Mr. de Zeeuw's framework for bargaining is supposed to form the basis
for further talks, culminating in the scheduled end of negotiations in
December. But time is running out and the serious horse-trading must start
soon, GATT officials warn.

As of last night, the EC apparently was resisting a demand in the de
Zeeuw document that GATT members disclose by Oct. 1 the specific subsidy
programs they have in place and the value of each of these. The EC appears
to be willing to discuss cuts in levels of aggregate support for farming,
but not, as Mr. de Zeeuw set out, cuts for each of three specific areas -
domestic assistance, import barriers and export subsidies.

The United States wants the information on EC programs broken down into
more detailed form and insists that cuts cover all three areas,
particularly export subsidies.

The thinking behind the demand is that once the costs and variety of
these programs are exposed, it will be easier to establish how contrary
they are to the spirit of international trade relations.

Other GATT members, including Japan, South Korea and Switzerland, were
also resisting the idea in preliminary talks of having to produce lists of
their subsidy programs.

The atmosphere surrounding the Uruguay Round talks has been
deteriorating all week.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter warned that the talks -
which cover 14 areas other than agriculture - will fail in their entirety
if the EC doesn't quickly soften its farm protectionism stand. After a
meeting in Brussels, EC trade ministers responded by reaffirming their
position.

Agriculture is the key item in the talks, but the procedural wrangles
so far have precluded much substantive negotiating.

Canada, which generally favors a major reduction in farm support, has
its own concerns with the de Zeeuw report. It doesn't want to have to give
up supply management schemes, particularly those providing import
protections for Quebec dairy farmers.

Canadian officials have pored over the document carefully and concluded
that it allows "in a rather cryptic way" for the continuation of such
schemes.

"We're all prepared, with reservations here and there, to work with
that report," a Canadian official said.

Counting pigs produces more than bacon bits

BIDDEFORD --- The U.S. Census Bureau does a fine job of counting heads, right?

Well, the agency apparently does such a good job that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is taking a page out of its book.

Starting Nov. 30, the New England division of the agriculture department is
going to be counting pigs.

That's right, the annual USDA Hog & Pig Survey is upon us once again. And when
the USDA does begins the annual two-week survey, you just know Christmas is just
around the corner.

The survey, by the way, counted 2,600 pig farms in New England last year. That
made for a total of 31,300 pigs.

You just know these pig surveys are a way for the folks over at the ag
department to bring home the bacon, right? OK, so you know a ham when you see
one.

Actually, the feds say there is a good reason for this survey. The results "are
used by farmers, grower associations, extension specialists, suppliers, lenders
and lawmakers to have the facts about agriculture when reviewing farm practices
and policies."

Now you know.

USS Maine sub stamp

to highlight show

SACO -- Visitors to this year's York County stamp show will get an extra treat
this year.

The U.S. Postal Service will offer a special cancellation commemorating
Saturday's annual show. The cancellation will be available from 9 a.m. to noon
at the Elks Club on Route 1.

The stamp cancellation was designed by the show's sponsors, the York County
Stamp Club in Sanford. It features the USS Maine submarine at Saco Station.

For those unable to attend the show, the special cancellation will be available
through the Saco Post Office in person or by mail through Dec. 6.

Requests by mail must be sent to USS Maine, Saco Station, 225 Main St., Saco, ME
04072-9996 and should include a self-addressed, stamped envelope.

Wooden jails

just don't make it

ALFRED --- York County Jail might have failed an inspection because of crowding,
but at least its brick walls comply with state law.

At a recent meeting of the Jail Advisory Committee, it was revealed that
although the Legislature has put few limits on jail construction, there is a law
barring any jail from being made out of wood.

The committee was researching the rules as part of its proposal to build a
replacement for the existing county jail in Alfred. According to committee
spokesman Fred Bechard, the law requires that a new county jail would have to be
built in Alfred unless a countywide vote orders it moved to another town.

No one on the committee knows exactly why wood is banned. Some guessed it is
meant to protect inmates from fire, others said it was to make escape harder.

The law, it seemed, was one of those obscure statutes that must have looked like
a good idea at the time it was passed, and has lived on in dusty law books only
to pop up years later and mystify.

The regulation seemed to be at odds with another old Maine law that was removed
from the books by the Legislature last year. It required all Maine sheriffs to
have their jails whitewashed each year, a necessity in an age of wooden jails.

British aid is held up in US fiasco

MoD furious after ban on EU meat keeps ration packs sitting on runways after
urgent delivery by the RAF, Ben Hoyle reports

The United States held up British emergency rations worth £4 million for five
days because of fears about the safety of European meat.

As the refugee crisis that followed the floods in Louisiana grew during the
week, more than 400,000 military ration packs sat at two airfields in America.

Washington had requested them last weekend, but the meals fell foul of a United
States Department of Agriculture ban on the import of certain products from the
European Union.

But last night, five days after the first batches of aid arrived from Britain
and after negotiations with the British Government, the agency waived the ban,
paving the way for the food to be distributed to those who need it.

A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: "The United States Department of Agriculture
has cleared ration packs for onward distribution. Meals from all EU member
states have been cleared."

However, British defence staff are furious that the delay prevented the rations
from reaching the refugees for whom they were intended until this weekend.

One member of the Ministry of Defence's Defence Logistics Organisation, which
helped to organise the airlift, said: "Can you imagine how this is going down at
our end? People were working their butts off on Sunday and Monday to make this
happen. This aid wasn't volunteered. The US asked for it.

"We moved heaven and earth to get this stuff out there. You don't send half a
million ration packs if you don't think they're going to be used."

The MoD estimates that the cost of supplying the meals was about £6 million.

A spokeswoman said: "The packs themselves cost £3 million to £4 million and the
airlift cost around $ 4 million (£2.2 million).

"We responded as quickly as possible to a request from the US authorities
following Hurricane Katrina -including specifically a request for emergency
ration packs. Some of these packs have arrived on US soil and the handling of
this is now a matter for the US authorities. It's a matter for them if and how
they distribute these packs."

The first batch of ration packs left RAF Brize Norton in two aircraft on Monday
morning. About half a million meals were assembled for transportation, of which
400,000 are at two airfields, one at Little Rock, Arkansas, the other in Texas.

Shipment of the remaining 100,000 packs had been suspended.

The packs sitting on the tarmac in Texas and Arakansas are standard issue
British military rations, designed to feed one soldier on operations for 24
hours.

Each one has 3,500 calories and can sustain a civilian in less-physically
demanding circumstances for two days. The packs include a boil-in-the-bag
breakfast, a main meal, a dessert, savoury snacks, biscuits, sweets, coffee and
tea and tissues.

Breakfast options are typically sausage or bacon served with beans. Lunch might
be a beef stew and dumplings, a chicken curry or a lamb hotpot. Desserts include
rice pudding and chocolate roll with chocolate sauce.

Vegetarian versions have also been sent.

Inside the cardboard pack there is a mini-stove and matches to heat up meals and
drinks, but they can be eaten cold if necessary.

Perhaps confusingly for their intended recipients, one of the chocolate bars
supplied in the packs is a Yorkie bar that bears the slogan "Not for civvies."

Farmers in danger: official

BYLINE: CP

Canadian Press
  REGINA
  Free trade would hurt farmers in both Canada and the United States, says
a Minnesota agriculture official.

State agriculture commissioner Jim Nichols said the Canada-U.S. trade
agreement would benefit only large grain companies, food processors, oil
companies, bankers and California fruit and vegetable growers.

He said Canadian cattle producers would be swamped by U.S. beef fed on
cheap corn while U.S. pork producers would have to contend with Canadian
imports that are cheaper because of the cheaper Canadian dollar.

And because the United States would be assured access to Canadian oil
and gas, attempts to make surplus grain into ethanol would be halted, he
said.

'(Prime Minister Brian) Mulroney sold you guys out cheap,' Mr.  Nichols told a
group of about 35 people attending a farm conference.

He also criticized the U.S. Government's agriculture subsidies. Mr.
Nichols is co-author of a bill before the U.S. Congress that he hopes will
replace the 1985 Farm Bill and provide production controls, fair interest
rates and debt restructuring.

He said the cheap-food policy hurts farmers and distorts Third World
economies but does not help consumers. The only ones benefitting are major
importers, such as the Soviet Union, he said.

Baucus says Canada 'robbing' U.S. farmers

BYLINE: Kelly McParland

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 288 words

DATELINE: Washington, DC


A Clinton administration study of Canadian wheat trading practices has concluded
that Canadian subsidies cost Washington US$600 million over four years in
additional farm program costs, a leading critic of the Canadian system said.

Sen. Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said he obtained the figure from an as-yet
unreleased report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture into support payments
for Canadian grain shipments.

In a statement to the U.S. Senate, Baucus accused Canada of using the agreement
to compete unfairly with U.S. grain producers.

''In the last several years, Canada has been working through some of the
loopholes to rob farmers, both here in the U.S. and in Mexico,'' he said.

He provided few details of the USDA report, compiled by a working group assigned
to look into complaints about Canadian practices.

A spokesman for Baucus was unable to expand on the charges. He said the figures
came from members of the panel preparing the report.

In addition to the added cost, Baucus said, ''subsidized Canadian shipments of
wheat are distorting the U.S. wheat market'' and may be finding their way into
U.S. farm export programs, where they are re-exported at taxpayer expense.

He urged the administration to employ a section of the U.S. farm law that
restricts imports of commodities if they interfere with the U.S. farm program.

He said Canadian imports should be required to show end-use certificates to
ensure they are not used in U.S. export programs.

Baucus has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Canadian grain transport
practices, which are accepted under the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, but
have attracted continued criticism from U.S. farm states.

Washington: Agriculture Specialist detect a new pest at San Juan Air Cargo
Facilities

LENGTH: 380 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists discovered a new
pest found for the first time in the nation.





 On January 4, 2016, while inspecting a shipment of cut flowers from Ecuador at
the Luis Munoz Marin Air Cargo facilities in Puerto Rico, a CBP Agriculture
Specialist intercepted an uncommon pest.  The insect was identified on March 21,
2016 by US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as Prairiana sp. (Cicadellidae),
considered an actionable pest and "First Time in Nation" interception.The insect
was found on Hydrangea sp., a species of flowering plants.  This insect is an
actionable pest and it is the first time it has been found at a United States
ports of entry.



 CBP Agriculture Specialists issued an Emergency Action Notification and the
shipment was destroyed at a CBP/USDA approved facility.



 "CBP Agriculture specialists have an important mission in safeguarding the
nation's agriculture", said Sonja Cruz-Fidalgo, San Juan Supervisory Operations
Manager - Agriculture.  "This first in port interception demonstrates the
vigilance of the agriculture specialists in Puerto Rico and their dedication to
detect and prevent foreign invasive plants and plant pests from entering through
our ports of entry."



 CBP Agriculture specialists work closely with Animal Plant Health Inspection
Services - Plant Protection & Quarantine to protect our nation's agriculture
resources against the introduction of foreign plant pests and animal diseases.
Detecting pests, evaluating their risk and implementing actions to prevent their
propagation are necessary steps taken by the federal government to protect local
agriculture.



 CBP Agriculture specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences and agricultural inspection.  Their duties include
inspecting tens of thousands of international air passengers and air and sea
cargo that arrive into the United States each day. Approximately 4,664 pest
interceptions were submitted to USDA at ports of entry in the San Juan Office of
Field Operations during Fiscal Year 2015.

U.S. group opposes proposed easing of import ban on Japan beef

LENGTH: 342 words



WASHINGTON -- A U.S. livestock industry group Friday opposed the government's
plan to ease a four-year import ban on Japanese beef because of mad cow disease
and urged Japan to lift its ban on American beef simultaneously with the
proposed step.

"NCBA will not support finalization of this proposed rule until Japan has
completed its process and accepts beef from the United States," the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association said in a statement.

"The United States has repeatedly called on Japan to open the border to U.S.
beef, and NCBA calls for this action simultaneously to allowing imports of
Japanese beef into the United States," it said.

The United States banned Japanese beef imports in September 2001 following the
discovery of the first case of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, in Japan.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday proposed easing the ban under
certain conditions, including completely removing specified risk materials, such
as spinal cords and brains, from carcasses. The USDA will receive public
comments on the proposal until Sept. 19.

Japan imposed an import ban American beef in December 2003 when the United
States discovered its first BSE case.

Last October, Japan and the United States agreed in principle that Japan would
resume imports of American beef from animals aged up to 20 months.

But it is taking time for Japan to ease the ban due to domestic procedures,
including a go-ahead from an expert panel, and this is irritating the United
States.

Japan conducts blanket testing for mad cow disease on all animals aged 20 months
or older, while the United States only tests a small percentage of animals.

US QUOTA REDUCTIONS WILL SHRINK CARIBBEAN SUGAR EXPORT EARNINGS

BYLINE: CANUTE JAMES; Journal of Commerce Special

SECTION: COMMODITIES, Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 521 words

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica


The earnings of Caribbean countries from sugar exported to the United States
will fall by nearly $ 70 million in the upcoming export year, as a result of
quota cuts instituted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

But some representatives of the Caribbean sugar industry say that the reduced
export earnings will be in line with prior years, and thus will not ose a
serious setback.

According to regional sources, the Caribbean's earnings from shipments under
quota to the United States in the 1991-92 quota year will be $ 69.3 million less
than the previous quota year.

"But the reduction is not alarming and is not a disaster for the exporters,"
said Frank Downie, executive chairman of the Sugar Industry Authority of
Jamaica, noting that the new quotas are similar to those that were granted for
the 1989-90 quota year.

Eight countries in the region that are beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin
Initiative and the Generalized System of Preferences are allowed to ship pre-
determined quantities of sugar to the United States duty-free.

The Caribbean exporters to the Unites States are the Dominican Republic, Belize,
Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts-Nevis, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Their
cumulative quota has been reduced to 310,495 metric tons, down 161,215 tons from
the 1990-91 quota year.

Last year's original quotas for the region were revised upward because of
production shortfalls by domestic U.S. producers when the industry was affected
by frost.

"The exporters received about $ 430 per ton for sugar supplied to the United
States in the past quota year," Mr. Downie said. "The price moved with the
forces of supply and demand in the United States."

The Dominican Republic, the Caribbean's second largest sugar producer after Cuba
(which does not have a U.S. quota) remains the region's main supplier. The
country is being allowed to ship 232,555 tons, despite a 35 percent reduction in
its allocation.

Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have also had their
quotas cut by 35 percent, while two of the smaller producers, Haiti and St.
Kitts-Nevis, have been cut by 9.6 percent.

Guyana will be able to ship 15,856 tons, while Belize and Jamaica have each been
allocated 14,535 tons. The quotas for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago are 9,249
tons each, and Haiti and St. Kitts-Nevis each have a quota for 7,258 tons.

The cutback in quotas for the region is being implemented despite an appeal from
Caribbean producers. In June Seymour Mullings, Jamaica's agriculture minister,
said the United States and the European Community were being asked not to cut
access despite shortfalls by some producers.

"We view this decline in production as being temporary, given the measures which
have been undertaken by a number of sugar-exporting countries," said Mr.
Mullings, who is a former chairman of the committee of agriculture ministers of
the Caribbean Community.

"Consequently, we are asking the United States and the European Community not to
initiate any action towards the reduction of quotas from Caribbean
sugar-exporting countries," he added.

Prices Paid To Farmers Unchanged

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 2, Column 4; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 308 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31


Prices farmers got for raw products in March, on the average, were unchanged
from a revised February index and also a year ago, the Agriculture Department
said today.

The report said higher prices for lettuce, cotton, cattle and tomatoes were
offset by lower prices for milk, hogs, strawberries, eggs and sweet corn, which
held the preliminary March reading at the revised February average.

Food grains and livestock feed grains, and oilseeds showed little change during
the month, the report said. Corn and wheat were down one cent a bushel each,
while soybean prices were unchanged.

''The all-beef cattle price has continued to increase since January,'' the
report said. ''Calves were at the highest price level since November 1980. Hog
prices dropped after showing small gains in February.''

No new figures were reported to show what happened to prices paid by farmers to
meet expenses. The most recent average computed in January showed farm expenses
running six-tenths of 1 percent higher than last October but 1.2 percent below a
year earlier.

The ''prices paid'' index is revised only once every three months because of a
cutback in funds. Meanwhile, the January figures were carried forward into
March, with the next revision scheduled in April.

Crop prices over all rose 2 percent from February but were down 9 percent from a
year ago, reflecting lower price supports and huge stockpiles of key
commodities, including corn and wheat, that have built up in recent years.

In a related report, the United States Department of Agriculture said the March
1 inventory of corn was estimated at 8.25 billion bushels, up 25 percent from
6.59 billion bushels a year earlier. Wheat stocks were put at 2.25 billion
bushels, down fractionally from March 1, 1986, and the soybean inventory, at
1.38 billion bushels, was up about 1 percent.

U.S. Has Distorted View;
Of Its Best Customer

BYLINE: Tsutomu Okamoto; Yomiuri Shimbun Economic Writer

SECTION: Pg. 7

LENGTH: 391 words


Let me to pose this question: Which country imports a larger amount of
agricultural products annually from the United States--Japan or the Soviet
Union?

But before answering, consider this. To date, Japan does not import any rice
from the United States.

One year ago and coinciding with the first day of the Houston summit of the
Group of Seven nations, an influential U.S. environmental group ran a full-page
advertisement in many U.S. newspapers to protesting Japanese whaling.

The main attraction of the ad was a drawing showing a grinning Japanese customs
officer allowing whales through customs, while in the background mountains of
soybeans, corn and other farm products from the United States have been refused
entry.

The message was clear: Japan is an unfair trading partner that continues to kill
whales but refuses to import U.S. agricultural products.

Now, let us answer the question that I posed at the beginning. The answer is
Japan.

Japan imported a total of $8.2 billion worth of U.S. farm products in 1989,
compared with the Soviet Union's $3.6 billion that year.

In fact, Japan annually imports more agricultural products from the United
States than the amount imported by the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Germany,
Spain and Britain combined.

In other words, Japan is United States' best customer with its imports alone
totaling about 20.4 percent of all U.S. farm exports.

All of the above statistics were released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Although most Americans are probably not aware of these statistics, it is
readily apparent that the environmentalists' ad is erroneous.

Unfortunately, a large majority of Americans will probably take the ad at face
value and agree that Japan's trade practices are indeed unfair.

Meanwhile, those Japanese who are aware of these statistics no doubt feel
frustrated and wonder why groups in the United States constantly vilify Japan,
when in fact, Japan is the United States' best customer.

One of the best expressions of this frustration can be found in Shintaro
Ishihara's book "The Japan That Can Say No."

No one can deny economic friction currently exists between Japan and the United
States. But it is a great pity that such friction has been aggravated by such a
simple yet constant misunderstanding between the two countries.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19


The United States Department of Agriculture said today that its latest estimate
puts Brazil's 1982-83 coffee crop at 16 million bags, a sharp decline as a
result of the July frost. The preliminary United States estimate of the
Brazilian crop following the frost had predicted the crop to be between 15
million and 18 million bags, the department said.

 FCC Mall Room

 As representatives of states with significant agricultural activity, we share
the goal of

 ensuring that access to high-quality communications networks in rural America
remains a top

 priority for the Commission.

 More than ever before, U.S. farmers and ranchers are demanding reliable,
high-speed

 mobile broadband services. Mobility is essential for new precision agriculture
technologies to

 deiiver productivity gains and environmental sustainability. These technologies
are tran~forming

 U.S. agriculture as American farmers and ranchers seek to feed, fuel, and
clothe an ever- · ·

 increasing global population using limited land, water, and other re~ources. ·
· .. . ·

 We applaud the Commission's recent decision to allow rate-of-return carriers to
access

 support for "standalone" broadband facilities. This step will help encourage
carriers to. deploy

 modem broadband-capable wireline networks in rural areas. Importantly, this is
necessary as

 consumers increasingly rely on wireless services and are "cutting the cord'' to
shift awa)' from

 wireline voice, and soaring mobile broadband relies on sufficient backhaul,
often provided by

 these wireline networks. Going forward, sufficient support must also be
available to preserve

 and expand mobile voice and broadband.

 Significant work remains to ensure that broadband services are availabie in
rural America

 and reasonably comparable to services enjoyed in urban areas. Simply stated,
broadband,

 particularly high-speed mobile broadband, is not readily available in many
rural areas or could

 be at risk absent the right policies and support through the Universal Service
Fund (USF). While

 progress has been made in the deployment of broadband, significant portions of
rural areas have

 been left behind. According to the FCC, 87 percent of rural Americans (52.2
million) lack ·

 access to mobile broadband with minimum advertised speeds of 10 Mbps/1 Mbps,
compared to

 45 percent of those. living in urban areas.

 Without the certainty that essential mobil~ broadband infrastructure will be
deployed and

 maintained, investments in agricultural productivity will be delayed or
bypassed altogether, and

 the potential efficiencies and benefits to rural communities will be lost. The
extension of high­

 speed mobile and backhaul facilities to a,gricultur~l croplands and ranch lands
must keep. p~ce

 ... , . .

 587

 with the ongoing deployment of technology in the field. Increasing numbers of
modems in the

 field means a growing demand for connectivity in the areas in which they
operate.

 The expansion of rural broadband should be a top priority of federal and state

 policymakers, as expanded deployment in rural areas will address important
economic,

 educational, health care, and public safety goals. Ongoing USF reform can
provide a mechanism

 for enabling mobile broadband access in rural communities where "people live,
work, and

 travel" that is truly comparable to broadband services provided in urban and
suburban areas. To

 accomplish this goal, USF should support mobile broadband at a minimum of
today's level to

 close the coverage gap while preserving existing service.

 In this regard, we ask you to give special attention as you work to establish
Phase II of

 the USF's Mobility Ftmd (MF). Given the importance of mobile services today,
the MF shouh:l

 be retained and updated to ensure that funding will promote new mobile
broadband deployment

 in unserved rural and agricultural areas and preserve and upgrade mobile
broadband where it is

 currently available. Importantly, the FCC must rely on realistic measurements
of network

 experience on the ground to determine areas to support.

 Croplands and ranch lands have lagged behind in adequate mobile coverage, even
as

 demand for coverage has grown. To address this coverage gap, we urge you to
consider a metric

 of broadband access in croplands (and farm buildings), or some other geographic
measurement,

 in addition to road miles, to identify these areas of greatest need. "Cropland"
coverage can be

 assessed using United States Department of Agriculture data for crop
operations, the United

 States Geological Survey's Land Use classification, or other databases.

 Agriculture is a significant generator of economic activity in our states. We
greatly

 appreciate your efforts to ensure that the latest mobile broadband services are
provided to all

 Americans, including those in agriculture whose livelihoods depend on it.

 Sincerely,

 United States Senator

Japan, EC cool toward farm plan

BYLINE: STEPHANIE NEBEHAY; REUT

LENGTH: 563 words

DATELINE: Geneva SWITZERLAND


BY  STEPHANIE NEBEHAY
 Reuter
  GENEVA
  Japan and the European Community say that U.S. proposals aimed at ending
all farm subsidies by the year 2000 went too far toward eliminating
government influence in world agricultural trade.

The United States presented its bold plan, which also called for an end
to import barriers, to a two-day meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade that ended yesterday.

'They were brave to jump in the water first,' Guy LeGras, EC director  general
of agriculture told a news briefing. 'But I question the realism  of their
proposal.'     Many agricultural nations, including Canada, Argentina and
Australia,  warmly endorsed the U.S. initiative at the session.

Under the Administration plan, the United States will offer to
dismantle all U.S. agricultural subsidy programs over 10 years that have
an effect on commodity markets. Only two exceptions will be allowed,
programs for farmers whose aid is separate from any impact on production
or trade, and genuine food aid programs to help the poor in developing
countries.

But, while delegates from Japan and the 12-nation EC agreed that huge
surpluses and low prices had led to a farm produce crisis, they too called
the U.S. plan unrealistic.

'To strip agricultural production of any intervention does not seem
economically reasonable, and may be dangerous,' Mr. LeGras said.

Yuji Ikeda, a senior member of Japan's trade delegation, said: 'To try
to regulate agriculture only by market force is not our idea. The American
proposal seems to be based on an extreme factor - just the market force.'
   Mr. Ikeda added: 'In the long run, we think a market force in
agriculture is important, but at the same time we think the specific
characteristics of agriculture must be recognized.'
   Unlike industrial production, agriculture depends on special conditions
such as climate and other variable factors that has to be taken into
account, he said.

Farm subsidies are a hot political issue in the EC, which last year
spent $23-billion (U.S.) on farm supports and has accumulated massive food
surpluses.

But the so-called Cairns Group of major farm nations, including
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary,
Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay,
have endorsed the U.S. plan.

'The U.S. proposal is a concrete starting point for our negotiations.  . . . But
we believe developing countries need special treatment,' said  Leopoldo
Tettamanti, Argentine ambassador to GATT.

'Argentina is losing about $5-billion a year because of the decline in
agriculture prices. That is the same amount it costs us to service our  debt,'
he said.

Daniel Amstutz, U.S. deputy agriculture secretary, told a news briefing
that the United States spends about $26-billion on direct subsidies to
agriculture.

'Simply stated, our proposal puts everything on the table,' he said.

Mr. Amstutz, who leaves office Aug. 1, said the U.S. proposal is in the
interest of poorer nations. 'Developing countries need an outlet for
production, a market from which they can gain foreign exchange.

'A more prosperous Third World will be a market for efficient  agriculture,' Mr.
Amstutz added. 'So the customers are there, but we  OECD (Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development) countries  are preventing those markets
from developing as fast as they can.'

NEW JERSEY JOURNAL;
MENTHOL AID FOR BEES

BYLINE: By Leo H. Carney

SECTION: Section 11NJ; Page 3, Column 3; New Jersey Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 277 words


The state's Department of Agriculture says that menthol, the ingredient found in
cough drops and some spray inhalers, cures bees' sore throats, too.

Bee farmers became alarmed last year when tracheal mites were found in some
hives in Burlington County. The mites cause a fast-spreading, often-fatal
disease, which had been identified in 28 states but never in New Jersey before
last year.

Carol Shipp, a spokeswoman for the department, said that menthol was used
experimentally in Mexico by the United States Department of Agriculture but that
it had never been proven effective in the United States until tested by the
state agriculture agency's Divisions of Plant Industry and Regulatory Control.
Taking the Federal agency's lead, Ms. Shipp said, the state agency proved that
menthol crystals, placed inside a hive at its apex, were effective in
eliminating the mites and in greatly reducing mortality. There are about 6,000
bee colonies in the state, according to the agency.

''We are the first state to have proven that menthol can be effectively used to
cure tracheal mites,'' Ms. Shipp said, adding that the success is expected to
have ''widespread impact far beyond New Jersey's borders as other states begin
to use menthol.''

The state agriculture agency sampled about 2,000 bee colonies each year, looking
for mites and other maladies, including those that can be spread from imported
species of bees.

Bees are important for more than their honey; they are used to pollinate crops.
Last year, according to the Agriculture Department, some 6,000 new colonies of
bees were imported from Georgia and Louisiana to help with blueberry
pollination.

PARASITIC MITES IMPERIL HONEYBEES IN 5 STATES

BYLINE: By BAYARD WEBSTER

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 832 words


A parasitic mite that preys on honeybees has invaded beehives in five states,
including New York, forcing the authorities to destroy millions of bees, a
spokesman for the Federal Department of Agriculture has disclosed.

Many of the affected areas have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the
infestation, Donald E. Nielson, a spokesman for the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, which is overseeing attempts to control the
infestation, said in an interview.

Although bee experts say the microscopic mite is unlikely to wipe out the
multibillion-dollar bee industry in the United States, the infestation, if it
spreads, would cause serious economic losses to beekeepers who depend on sales
of honey and to the thousands of farmers who depend on honeybees to pollinate
their crops.

The mite infestations, confirmed by laboratory tests in recent weeks, have been
found in apiaries in New York, Florida, Texas, Louisiana and South Dakota. More
than 150 million honeybees involved in commercial honey production and crop
pollination have been purposely destroyed in infested areas.

The mite, Acarapis woodi, is a member of the family of arachnids that includes
spiders, ticks and scorpions. It preys on honeybees by piercing the trachea, or
windpipe, and laying eggs there. When the young mites hatch, they suck the bee's
body fluids, weakening the bee and reducing its honey- making and pollination
capabilities.

The mite is believed to have crossed the Rio Grande into the United States from
Mexico.

There is no known way to control the spread of the pest, according to
entomologists, because no insecticide that would kill or repel the mite without
harming the bees or adding toxic substances to the honey has been approved by
any United States Government regulatory agency. And in those countries where
miticides are used, they have not been able to eradicate infestations.

The harm to bees from the mites varies with the intensity of the infestation,
the general health of the hive and the severity of the climate. Bee specialists
said mite infestations in Northern states would seriously weaken the bees there
and impair their ability to survive the winter.

Beekeepers fear that the spread of the mites could occur rapidly in the United
States because of the mobility of the bee industry, which involves 200,000
beekeepers who maintain more than four million honeybee colonies. To provide
crop pollinating services, beekeepers regularly move colonies from state to
state. Such shipments are largely responsible for the spread of bee mites around
the world.

The total economic effect of the infestation is impossible to predict, said Mr.
Nielson, the Agriculture Department spokesman.

But Dr. Roger A. Morse, a Cornell University entomologist who has studied the
honeybee mites and their effect in South America, estimated that the newly
discovered infestation in the United States might cause about a 5 percent loss
in honey production in the affected areas, along with a similar loss of
efficiency in the pollination of crops.

Alert at Mexico Border

The mite was first found by inspectors in the Agriculture Department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service in a 50-mile-wide strip in the Rio Grande
Valley along the Mexican border. They had been alerted to the possibility of
mite invasion when the mites had spread to within 150 miles of the United States
border.

They first found that hives in Texas near Pecos, Houston-Baytown, Turkey, Corpus
Christi and Three Rivers were infected. Further investigation revealed that a
Texas apiarist had shipped infected bees to other areas and that the infestation
had spread.

To prevent further expansion in that area, the Agriculture Department ordered
that infected hives and bee colonies within a mile of mite-plagued hives be
destroyed by applications of calcium cyanide. The quarantine also prohibits
importation of bees from Mexico or other infected areas into any state and bans
bee shipments out of the area. The quarantine does not include the transport of
honey or pollen, which are not affected by the mites.

Infected Bees Under Study

To accelerate research into the biology of the mite and how it might be
controlled, local beekeeping associations and Department of Agriculture
specialists have collected hives filled with infected bees and are keeping them
in an isolated area as a kind of outdoor laboratory.

Although scientists and Agriculture Department representatives were reluctant to
predict the eventual outcome of the mite infestation, Dr. Morse of Cornell said,
''It's bound to become widespread and we're going to have to live with it.''

He added that he hoped the Agriculture Department would focus its research on
the biology of the mite and how its effects could be mitigated or controlled. He
said the mite invasion made it necessary to begin an intensive bee-breeding
program to develop a resistant honeybee strain.

American Embassy leads trade mission to promote innovation in agriculture

LENGTH: 311 words

DATELINE: New York



 ISLAMABAD: US Embassy Economic Counselor Joel Robert Garverick will lead a
delegation of senior Pakistani government officials, businessmen, farmers and
agriculture experts to Atlanta, Georgia, from January 28 to February 4, to
promote U.S.-Pakistan bilateral commercial
 ties and increase trade and investment in agriculture.


 According to US embassy here, the delegation will attend the 2017 International
Production and Processing Expo (IPPE), the United States' largest annual trade
show for the poultry, meat, and feed industries, building on the theme,
"innovation in agriculture."
 Agriculture is Pakistan's leading industry, accounting for more
 than 20 per cent of GDP and two-fifths of employment. Major products
 include cotton, wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, dairy, beef,
mutton, poultry and eggs.
 The United States is Pakistan's largest trading partner, exporting
 $447 million in agricultural goods to Pakistan in 2015. These imports
 help support Pakistani agricultural exports, which were $ 3.7 billion in fiscal
year 15/16 (July-June).
 Following the expo, the group will meet with U.S. agribusiness executives and
researchers, including experts at the Georgia Tech Agriculture Technology
Research Group and Innovation Lab, to explore innovations that could benefit
Pakistan, expand bilateral trade, and
 create investment opportunities for U.S. companies.
 The group will also visit a peach farm in Georgia, and conduct
 meetings with Georgia's Farm Bureau, Cotton Commission, State
 Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
 Research Service.
 Representatives from all four provinces of Pakistan will take part in the trade
mission, as well as officials from the Ministry of Food Security and Research,
the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and the Muhammad Nawaz Sharif
University of Agriculture Multan.

Grain Sales To China Rise

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 2, Column 4; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 200 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 26


The Agriculture Department today announced the largest grain purchase by China
in nearly a year. Department officials said private American exporters reported
selling China 200,000 metric tons of United States wheat for delivery under the
third year of a long-term grain agreement with that nation. It brings to more
than 3.2 million metric tons the amount of United States corn and grain
purchased so far by the Chinese under the agreement that requires them to buy at
least 6 million metric tons by the end of the year. The latest sale is the
largest for the current agreement year since one announced in October 1982,
eclipsing sales of 180,000 tons and 30,000 tons made earlier this month. The
renewed grain trade between the United States and China follows a suspension of
purchases after the two nations became embroiled in a dispute over textile
quotas. That problem was ironed out in late July and since then major wheat-
state lawmakers have been urging the Chinese to resume purchases so they can
keep their agreement commitment to buy at least 6 million metric tons of United
States grain before year's end. A metric ton equals 2,205 pounds and consists of
about 36.7 bushels of wheat.

Expert sees adequate supplies of corn, beans; Crop prices decline sharply from
last year

BYLINE: JOHN EVERLY

SECTION: Agriculture; Pg. b4

LENGTH: 671 words


It must be spring. The grass is greening, baby calves are everywhere and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture released its annual Prospective Plantings Report.

The department placed this year's corn acreage 1 percent higher than last year.
Projected corn acreage, at 81.4 million, was somewhat below average trade
expectations, but, if realized, will be the largest corn acreage since 1985.

"It could still give us a corn crop, if we use a trend yield, in the
neighborhood of 10.8 billion bushels," said Keith Collins, chief economist for
the agriculture department. "So, even though this figure for corn might not be
as high as some people suggest, it still suggests a very strong production
possibility for the 2005 crop."

Last year's corn crop produced 11.8 billion bushels.

Soybean acreage, meanwhile, was down 2 percent from last year, influenced by
Asian soybean rust fears in the South.

Assuming trend yields based on the intended acreage in the Agriculture
Department report, we should see adequate supplies of corn and beans for the
2005-06 marketing year, according to Darrel Good, a marketing specialist for the
University of Illinois Extension.

"Stocks would remain relatively high for corn and soybeans for another year,"
Good said. "The market will watch the development of the United States crop for
any indication of deviation from trend yield. Soybean rust will garner special
attention. In addition, the development of the world wheat crop and the Chinese
corn crop will be monitored to judge potential export demand for crops in the
United States."

Based on the Agriculture Department's Grain Stocks Report, also released March
31, Good said corn supplies at the end of this marketing year look to be the
largest in 17 years and should keep pressure on prices. March 1 soybean supplies
were up 52 percent from a year earlier.

In the meantime, crop prices have dropped considerably from last year. The
Agriculture Department reported cash corn prices across the United States
averaged $2.03 per bushel, up 8 cents from February but 72 cents below March
2004. The soybean price, at $6.28 per bushel, increased 86 cents from February
but is $3 below March 2004.

Iowa farmers said they intend to increase corn acreage by almost a percentage
point from 2004. Illinois corn acreage is expected to jump 2.1 percent, while
Wisconsin farmers are increasing corn acreage by 2.8 percent.

Iowa farmers also said they intend to find more room for soybeans, increasing
acreage by 1 percent from last year. Illinois bean acreage was projected to fall
2.5 percent, and Wisconsin farmers said their soybean acres will drop 3.1
percent.

The International Trade Commission recently ruled that live swine imports from
Canada have not injured the domestic market in the United States. The
commission's vote means duties ranging up to 18.87 percent assessed by the
Commerce Department will not be imposed.

The ruling was welcomed by the Pork Trade Action Coalition, which opposed the
duties.

"This is a victory for the hundreds of American farmers who have adapted to the
advantages offered by NAFTA and who would have been devastated by the proposed
duties," said John R. Block, former U.S. secretary of agriculture and senior
adviser to the Pork Trade Action Coalition.

"The overall hog industry is more efficient," he said. "Swine imports from
Canada are just 3.3 percent of the total American market. More importantly, U.S.
hog prices are near record levels, and the U.S. herd is growing."

The National Pork Producers Council, which filed the ITC petition, did not see
it that way.

"Canadian producers enjoy an unfair advantage over U.S. producers due to
government subsidies, which shield producers north of the border from market
losses and signal to reduce production," said Don Buhl, president of the
National Pork Producers Council.

KDTH for nearly 10 years. His e-mail address is jeverly@wcinet.com.

Europe Upset By U.S. Step

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 1


The European Community said today that the United States' latest move to
increase subsidies for farm exports suggested that Washington was not committed
to serious reforms.

The European Community's deadlock with the United States over agriculture is the
biggest obstacle to progress in the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize world
trade. The talks will resume at the ministerial level next month after a
stalemate in Montreal in December.

The United States Agriculture Secretary, Clayton K. Yeutter, asked Congress on
Tuesday to remove the ceiling on United States spending on subsidies under the
Export Enhancement Program to strengthen Washington's hand in the talks, held
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Mr. Yeutter's remarks ''are not helpful to the development of a cordial and
friendly atmosphere in these negotiations, so essential to the interests of U.S.
and European Community agriculture,'' the European Commission's Agriculture
Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, said in a statement.

 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the authority of the AMA (7 U.S.C.

 1621-1627), as amended, GIPSA establishes and maintains a variety of

 quality and grade standards for agricultural commodities that serve as

 a fundamental starting point to define commodity quality in the

 domestic and global marketplace. Standards developed by GIPSA under the

 AMA include rice, whole dry peas, split peas, feed peas, lentils, and

 beans. The AMA standards are voluntary and widely used in private

 contracts, government procurement, marketing communication, and, for

 some commodities, consumer information. The U. S. Standards for Rough

 Rice, Brown Rice for Processing, and Milled Rice standards were last

 revised in 2002 and appear in the AMA regulations at 7 CFR 868.202

 through 868.316. The standards facilitate the marketing of rice in

 foreign and domestic trade, and provide a uniform measure of quality by

 providing a common language to describe commodity attributes for U.S.

 producers, exporters and their customers. Official procedures for

 inspections are provided in GIPSA's



 [[Page 79491]]



 Rice Inspection Handbook for determining the various grading factors.

     GIPSA inspects shipments of rice in accordance with AMA standards

 to establish the grade of the rice and issues inspection certificates

 for each shipment. GIPSA-issued certificates describing the quality and

 condition of graded rice are accepted as prima facie evidence in all

 Federal courts. U. S. rice standards and the affiliated grading and

 testing services offered by GIPSA verify that a seller's rice meets

 specified requirements, and ensure that customers receive the quality

 of rice they purchased. In addition to Federal usage, the rice

 standards are applied by one State and one private cooperator.

     In order for U. S. standards and grading procedures for Rough Rice,

 Brown Rice for Processing, and Milled Rice to remain relevant, GIPSA is

 issuing this request for information to invite interested parties to

 submit comments, ideas, and suggestions on all aspects of the U. S.

 Standards for Rice and inspection procedures.

FUTURES/OPTIONS ;
Grains and Soybeans Mixed in Slow Trading



BYLINE:
By The Associated Press

SECTION: Section 1; Page 43, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 352 words


Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in light trading yesterday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.

Weather continued to dominate the market, sources said. The forecast calls for
beneficial conditions throughout most of the major growing areas for the next
week to 10 days, and analysts said that discouraged buying.

The corn crop appears to be in excellent condition in most areas, and Richard
Loewy, a grain analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities, said major
purchases from foreign buyers are likely to be made for delivery after the
harvest, a development that encouraged selling in the September contract.

Anticipation that next week's Agriculture Department report on exports will be
disappointing also encouraged selling, Mr. Loewy said.

The United States Department of Agriculture reported yesterday that the Soviet
Union had purchased another 1.1 million tons of United States corn and 325,000
tons of wheat. Sources said another purchase of 500,000 tons of corn reported to
an undisclosed country had probably also been made to the Soviet Union.

The purchases led to speculation among analysts that the Russians are likely to
purchase the entire 12 million tons of grain permitted in their long-term trade
agreement with the United States, and they might seek permission to buy even
more.

Livestock and meat prices were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Weakness in the hog market reflected lower prices on cash wholesale markets,
Phil Stanley, a livestock analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities,
said, while cattle were under pressure from ideas that demand has been week.

Petroleum prices continued falling on the New York Mecantile Exchange.

European customers said they were informed by the Soviet Union that it was was
discounting its crude oil price by $1.50 a barrel, a development that put
pressure on the market. Indications that Egypt would follow suit, putting more
pressure on the British National Oil Company to also lower its price, also
prompted selling, said Lois Peltz, a petroleum analyst in New York with Merrill
Lynch Commodities.

Citrus farming heads south

BYLINE: Reuter

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 44

LENGTH: 274 words

DATELINE: Miami, FL


Florida's citrus industry is inching further south with each killer freeze, a
migration that has driven most of the orange groves out of Orange County and
left very little citrus fruit in Citrus County.

Florida has escaped the chill so far this winter. Fruit damage occurs when
temperatures dip below -2 C for at least four hours, while sustained
temperatures in the -7 C range can kill the trees, said Paul Messenger, a citrus
expert with the Florida Department of Agriculture.

Despite a series of damaging freezes over the past decade, citrus farming
remains Florida's top agricultural industry, producing US$3.3 billion worth of
fruit annually and pumping US$6 billion a year into the state's economy.

The march to warmer climes began shortly after Florida's first groves were
planted along the St. Johns River in the northeast corner of the state in the
1860s, Messenger said.

A series of freezes in the 1880s and 1890s killed the trees and drove the citrus
farmers 160 to 225 kilometres south, to the central inland region around Orlando
and Lakeland.

The development of frozen orange juice concentrate after the Second World War
fuelled a planting boom that pushed the groves down into the Indian River area,
just north of the Everglades on the Atlantic Coast.

But the central third of the state dominated Florida's citrus industry for
nearly a century, Messenger said. The swampy southern third was considered
unsuitable until a vicious freeze hit the state in 1962.

''That did so much damage that people thought, 'If we're going to stay in the
citrus business, we're going to have to go further south.

Senate Panel Cuts Funds For Commodity Support

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 15, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 261 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13


The Senate Agriculture Committee today cut about $1 billion from commodity
support programs approved two weeks earlier, bringing its 1981 farm bill close
to next year's spending targets.

''We've got a bill here that might sell,'' Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of
Indiana, said as the nine-member Republican majority on the committee forced
through a compromise that included a major reduction in milk price supports.

While agreeing that the committee's version of the four-year farm bill was not a
victory for President Reagan, Deputy Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said,
''It certainly isn't a loss.''

He called it a ''valiant effort'' by the committee to meet spending restrictions
outlined by Mr. Reagan.  But Mr. Lyng also said there were portions of the bill
''the Administration will object to.'' He declined to be specific.  The Senate
committee's original version of the 1981 farm bill exceeded 1982 budget
restrictions by $1.2 billion, according to Congressional estimates. The final
plan is about $100 million above the limit.

The reduction in dairy supports, which accounted for nearly half the budget
overrun, was the key to the committee's completion of work on the bill. The
panel put minimum support levels for the next four years at 70 percent of
parity, the same level Mr. Reagan wants.  Supports could rise to 75 percent if
Government dairy stocks declined substantially.

Arkansas: Prelminary ag census results show growing farm economy

LENGTH: 479  words

DATELINE: Little Rock


Arkansas Farm Bureau, The State of Arkansas has issued the following news
release:

USDA today released the preliminary 2012 Census of Agriculture results. Key
findings include an increase in the value of agricultural products sold in the
United States totaling $394.6 billion in 2012, up 33 percent ($97.4 billion)
from 2007. The number of farms and land in farms were down slightly, but held
steady. Additionally, agriculture is becoming more diverse.

The 2012 Census reported several historic changes in value of sales for
agriculture producers in the United States:

In 2012, crop sales of $212.4 billion exceeded livestock sales of $182.2
billion. This occurred for only the second time in Census history; the other
time was 1974.
 Between 2007 and 2012, per farm average value of sales increased from $137,807
to $187,093, continuing a steady 30-year upward trend. The increase of $52,285
was the largest rise in Census history.

Preliminary data from the 2012 Census of Agriculture also highlights national
and state farm numbers, land in farms and farmer demographics.

The 2012 Census showed principal farm operators are becoming older and more
diverse; following the trend of pervious censuses. In 2012, the average age of a
principal farm operator was 58.3 years, up 1.2 years since 2007, and continuing
a 30-year trend of steady increase. The Census also accounted for
minority-operated farms in 2012 than in 2007.
 In 2012, the United States had 2.1 million farms - down 4.3 percent from the
previous Census in 2007. In terms of farm size by acres, this continues an
overall downward trend in mid-sized farms, while the smallest and largest-size
farms held steady.
 Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of land in farms in the United States
continued a slow downward trend declining from 922 million acres to 915 million.
This is only a decline of less than one percent and is the third smallest
decline between censuses since 1950.

Conducted since 1840, the Census of Agriculture accounts for all U.S. farms and
ranches and the people who operate them. The Census tells a story of how
American agriculture is changing and lays the groundwork for new programs and
policies that will invest in rural America; promote innovation and productivity;
build the rural economy; and support our next generation of farmers and
ranchers.

"The release of the preliminary 2012 Census of Agriculture results is only a
first look at the data and we are eager to publish the final report this May,"
said NASS Administrator Cynthia Clark. "The 2012 Census was not conducted in a
typical crop year, and drought had a major impact on U.S. agriculture, affecting
crop yields, production and prices. NASS is still reviewing all 2012 Census
items to the county level and therefore data are preliminary until published in
the final report."

BORDER CHARGES

SECTION: Pg. A12

LENGTH: 470 words


The U.S. Department of Agriculture has taken an important first step in delaying
rules that would require all trucks and airline passengers crossing the border
from Canada to pay a fee to help pay for inspections. It should now use the
additional time to search for less burdensome ways, other than inspecting every
truck, to prevent diseased fruit and invasive plants from entering the United
States.

In announcing the delay the department said it was doing so to allow "affected
entities" to make preparations to comply with new inspection procedures. The
delay is appropriate, but not for this reason.

Commercial traffic from Canada has long been exempt from U.S. rules requiring
inspections of and fees from commercial conveyances and international air
passengers entering this country because Canadian agricultural exports
traditionally are grown in Canada and do not harbor pests or plants of concern
to the United States. Because more produce from around the world is now going to
Canada, the department last month said it would eliminate the Canadian
exemptions beginning today.

All commercial conveyances crossing from Canada to the United States, regardless
of what they were carrying, would have been subject to inspection. All would
have paid a fee, and airline passengers coming into the United States from
Canada were to be charged $5.

The department said repeatedly in the 18-page notice of the new rule that it
needs to raise more money to cover the cost of the existing and new inspections.
If the department needs more money to conduct legitimate inspections, it should
use the delay to persuade Congress to appropriate the funds or develop a plan to
have shippers that pose real risks cover the costs.

In a recent letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns and Homeland Security
Secretary Michael Chertoff, Sen. Susan Collins noted the potential for back-ups
at the border caused by additional inspections and delays in products crossing
the border, which could harm businesses in the United States and Canada.

Sen. Collins, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs
Committee, urged the department to consider assessing fees only on agricultural
shipments and to work with programs that already provide border security.

Both are good suggestions.

The Canadian government strongly objects to the rules. One of the few cases the
Department of Agriculture uses to justify the rule is the 2004 interception of
Spanish oranges and Dutch peppers labeled as products of Canada. The Canadian
embassy says it was never made aware of this problem, but would have worked with
the United States to enforce laws against such re-labeling.

The delay gives the agriculture department time to look at this and other
alternatives rather than moving ahead with an unnecessarily burdensome and broad
rule.

U.S. beef ban set to loosen

BYLINE: DAVE EBNER

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS: CANADIAN; AGRICULTURE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 556 words

DATELINE: CALGARY


The export of live Canadian cattle younger than 30 months can resume in early
March based on a new rule put forth by the United States Department of
Agriculture yesterday, bringing the 1½-year-old mad-cow crisis close to a
conclusion.

"This is a major step forward," said Stan Eby, president of the Canadian
Cattlemen's Association. "We're quite pleased. It's been a long 19 months. Our
confidence is lifting as we speak."

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's new rule for cattle imports, introduced
yesterday, is effective as of March 7.

It opens the door to live Canadian cattle that has been firmly closed since May,
2003, when one animal with mad-cow disease - known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) - was discovered on an Alberta farm.

Canada will now be recognized as a "minimal-risk region," which the United
States is defining as a place where BSE has been found but where sufficient
regulatory measures have been put in place to make the introduction of the
disease to the United States "unlikely."

The U.S. border had already been opened to some Canadian beef products, but
yesterday's step was the big move that Canadian ranchers had been waiting for.
In 2002, the last full year of exports, Canada moved about $1.7-billion of beef
products to the United States and about the same amount of live cattle.

"We are confident that imports of certain commodities from regions of minimal
risk can occur with virtually no risk to human or animal health," Ann Veneman,
the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, told reporters on a conference call.

The new rule, which runs longer than 500 pages, may be challenged in court by
American ranchers, although Mr. Eby said he is hopeful that the agriculture
department has "all the angles covered." Ted Haney, president of the Canada Beef
Export Federation, said he believes the department has "done its homework."

"[The department] has specifically prepared this rule to be immune from
litigation, though I'm sure there are protectionist elements that will try to
challenge this," Mr. Haney said.

The United States will now be open to almost all Canadian beef, although Mr.
Haney said some work is left because restrictions remain on breeding cattle and
live cattle aged 30 months and older.

Still, he said, "95 per cent of our total recovery is now at hand."

Mr. Haney praised the new rule, calling it "very open and liberal." He said
that, in addition to live cattle younger than 30 months, which are those
considered to be at the lowest risk for BSE, the United States also plans to
take processed beef products from animals aged 30 months and older. This could
lead to similar changes elsewhere, he said.

"Because the U.S. tends to set precedents, other countries will probably
follow," Mr. Haney said.

The BSE crisis hit Canadian beef producers hard, costing about $5-billion,
according to a Bank of Montreal report from November that was cited yesterday by
Bloomberg News.

Bloomberg also referred to a November report from Statistics Canada that showed
the country's inventory of cattle was at a record 16.8 million, up 6.5 per cent
from a year earlier.

Mr. Haney said a ban on exports of live cattle to the United States is leading
to a large increase in processing capacity in Canada, which could be more than
40 per cent higher in early 2006 than it was in 2002.

SUIT SEEKS INQUIRY INTO CHARGES OF CRUELTY TO DOGS

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

SECTION: Section B; Page 11, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 575 words


An animal-protection organization filed suit against the United States
Department of Agriculture yesterday to compel it to enjoin a surgical-supply
company from using dogs to test operating techniques until the Government can
investigate charges of cruelty to animals.

''We believe some Dark Age cruelty is going on,'' said Pirscilla Feral, the New
England director of Friends of Animals. Her organization filed the suit in
Federal District Court in New Haven in an attempt to halt the use of dogs by the
United States Surgical Corporation, a private company based in Norwalk, Conn.
The Agriculture Department is responsible for licensing the use of laboratory
animals. The company is not named as a defendant in the suit.

The civil suit said that the company had violated Federal law by not providing
proper anesthesia while operations were being performed on the dogs, and that
the animals had been obtained from unlicensed sellers. Both conditions were in
violation of the Federal Animal Welfare Act of 1966, the suit said. Philip M.
Hart, the lawyer for Friends of Animals, said a list of specific instances of
reported violations would be filed at a later date.

Charges Are Denied

The company denied the charges emphatically and at length, asserting that it was
''responding to the needs of the medical profession and of human beings'' in
testing and demonstrating the 12 models of its surgical staple guns. The guns
are used in many operations instead of conventional needle stitching.

Over a recent 12-month period, according to Marianne Scipione, a spokesman for
the company, the concern operated on and then put to death 974 dogs. She added
that each animal had been anesthetized and kept on a respirator until the
surgical procedure was completed, after which the animal was given a fatal
injection. The dogs were buried in Balmoral Pet Cemetery in New Milford, about
35 miles north of Norwalk.

She said that the animals, ''which must be sacrificed to advance the care and
cure of human beings,'' had been obtained only from federally authorized dealers
and were ''cared for properly under veterinarian supervision, treated humanely,
and fully anesthetized during surgical learning procedures.'' She declined to
give the purchase price of the animals.

Stirred Strong Emotions

The Friends of Animals and the company agreed that the allegations had stirred
strong emotions. The organization has picketed the company twice with such signs
as ''Animals Have Rights Too.''

The company has responded with full-page advertisements in a local newspaper
that included a testimonal from a minister who thanked ''the Lord for you and
your staple gun.''

Mrs. Feral said that the allegations had been based in part on information
obtained from former employees of the company.  The dogs are used as subjects in
operations performed by company employees to perfect designs on the highly
technical devices and to demonstrate the stapling devices to surgeons, the
company spokesman said.

The company had sales of close to $80 million in the first nine months of 1981.
It develops, manufactures and markets the devices, which the company estimates
were used in 15 percent of the 21 million surgical procedures performed in this
country last year.

Farmers asked to adopt modern techniques to increase agriculture productivity

BYLINE:  RECORDER REPORT

SECTION: Vol. XLVIII No. 112

LENGTH: 420  words


Deputy Agriculture Counsellor, United States Embassy in Islamabad, Devid Wolf,
on Saturday said Pakistan is blessed with favourable climatic conditions for
agricultural productivity and can earn heavy foreign exchange by exporting it
after fulfilling it demands.

He was addressing a concluding session of three-day training programme on
demonstration and dissemination of irrigation techniques arranged by Water
Management Research Centre (WMRC), University of Agriculture Faisalabad in
collaboration with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) at a farmer
gathering in village 159 GB Mongi Bangla.

In the village, the university has set up fields with the latest techniques
causing 25 percent of yield increase with less water.

The aim of the demonstration was to showcase the latest techniques in a bid to
persuade the farming community about adoption it with the theme of "seeing
believes".

Devid Wolf also urged Pakistan farming community to adopt the modern trends of
agriculture in order to increase productivity and end the hunger from the
country.

He said that the US was providing funds to uplift the agricultural sector of the
Pakistan and will continue initiatives in this regard.

He said that USDA had a long history working for the development of agriculture
by investing especially in the technology transfer that was vital to the way of
progress.

He said that under the trilateral relations among US, Pakistan and Afghanistan,
the US was improving the wheat, maize, cotton and other crops productivity in
the region.

He also visited the fields of wheat, cotton, maize, vegetables and tunnel
farming set up by UAF and lauded the efforts aimed at maintaining food security
with increased productivity.

International Centre for Agricultural Research (ICARDA) Country Manager Dr Abdul
Hamid said that his company was working in 70 countries with the special focus
on water as the crisis has started hitting the globe.

He said that under the project funded by USDA, they were focusing on arid areas
but for the cause of water, they are functioning in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Punjab
and other part of the country.

He said that they were managing USDA funded project on demonstration and
dissemination of irrigation techniques.

Faculty of Agricultural Engineering, UAF, Dean and WMRC Director Professor Dr
Rai Niaz Ahmad said that bed planting not only increases the agricultural
productivity 25 percent but also save water.

Keeping in view the project was initiated to promote the technology with
demonstration effects.

MIDDLE WEST GOVERNORS URGED TO PUT FARM PROBLEMS IN FOREFRONT

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 1; Page 10, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 331 words

DATELINE: LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 16


Governors must educate the public about severe economic conditions affecting
farmers and the relationship between agriculture and the economy, Gov. Ted
Schwinden of Montana said today.

''Agriculture must catch America's attention if it is to earn America's
commitment,'' Governor Schwinden, a Democrat who is a member of the Western
Governors Association, said in a speech to the Midwestern Governors Conference.

''As governors,'' he said, ''we can and must agitate for a more informed
policy-making climate where agricultural policy decisions can be made with a
maximum of information and a minimum of emotion.''

Mr. Schwinden cited a public information program on the economic importance of
agriculture that had been initiated by the Western Governors Association.

He said the ''Image of Agriculture'' project was ''based on the belief that
unless the American public better understands agriculture and its role in the
economy, Congress won't be convinced to develop a responsible, long-term,
comprehensive food and farm policy.'' Even New York City'

He said that if the efforts succeeded, debate on farm legislation in 1985 '' can
focus more on long-term agricultural policy and less on short-term,
crisis-response programs.''

''If we can show that agriculture affects the prosperity of a state like New
York, and even New York City,'' he added, ''the issue will no longer be
relegated to the back pages of the newspaper.''

The governors adopted a resolution offered by Gov. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a
Democrat, urging the Federal Government to reduce its budget deficit. Governor
Kerrey said the deficit had kept interest rates high and curtailed exports
because of a strong dollar.

He said the ailing farm economy had sent ''a ripple effect'' through the economy
by reducing the purchasing power of farmers and of others in farm-related jobs.

His resolution also called for governors in the Middle West to lobby for
increased prices for farmers' goods.

opportunity to learn about safe outdoor recreation and natural resources
conservation, and may even offer a glimpse of wildlife that you don't get to see
every day."

National Public Lands DayThis is an external link or third-party site outside of
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. began in 1994 with
three sites and 700 volunteers. It proved to be a huge success and became a
yearly tradition, typically held on the last Saturday in September. Since the
first NPLD, the event has grown by leaps and bounds. In 2013, about 175,000
volunteers served at 2,237 sites in every state, the District of Columbia, Guam
and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

Nearly 108,000 volunteers and service members contributed 4.3 million hours on
critical projects on national forests, grasslands and prairies last year. Their
service was valued at close to $94 million.

Nationwide, the Forest Service has registered over 156 sites across the United
States and Puerto Rico. As an agency that manages public lands, the Forest
Service highlights National Public Lands Day projects on national forests and
grasslands that include connections to wilderness and youth engagement in
conservation stewardship, education and outdoor recreation.

The following projects were selected as National Signature Events, based on
demonstrated commitment to conservation stewardship:

Sawmill Gulch TrailheadThis is an external link or third-party site outside of
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website., Missoula, Montana
 Spring Mountains National Recreation AreaThis is an external link or
third-party site outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
website., Las Vegas, Nevada
 Grey Towers National Historic SiteThis is an external link or third-party site
outside of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website., Milford,
Pennsylvania

All three projects will focus on expanding volunteerism, engaging diverse
communities, 21st Century Conservation Service Corps and the Wilderness 50th
Anniversary.

Several other Federal agencies are also observing National Public Lands Day. To

website.

The Forest Service also offers fee-free days in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.
Day, National Get Outdoors Day and Veterans Day. Fees are waived generally for
day use areas, such as picnic grounds, developed trailheads and destination
visitor centers. Fees are not waived for concessionaire-operated facilities or
for overnight use such as camping or recreation rentals. Contact your local
national forest to learn if your destination requires a fee and if that fee is
waived.

The mission of the Forest Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests
and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency
manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and
private landowners, and maintains the largest forestry research organization in
the world. Public lands the Forest Service manages contribute more than $13
billion to the economy each year through visitor spending alone. Those same
lands provide 20 percent of the Nation's clean water supply, a value estimated
at $7.2 billion per year. The agency has either a direct or indirect role in
stewardship of about 80 percent of the 850 million forested acres within the
U.S., of which 100 million acres are urban forests where most Americans live.

West virginia: 2012 Census of Agriculture Preliminary Results Show Growing Farm
Economy

LENGTH: 481  words

DATELINE: Charleston


The State of West Virginia has issued the following news release:

USDA today released the preliminary 2012 Census of Agriculture results.  Key
findings include an increase in the value of agricultural products sold in the
United States totaling $394.6 billion in 2012, up 33 percent ($97.4 billion)
from 2007.  The number of farms and land in farms were down slightly, but held
steady. Additionally, agriculture is becoming more diverse.

The 2012 Census reported several historic changes in value of sales for
agriculture producers in the United States:

In 2012, crop sales of $212.4 billion exceeded livestock sales of $182.2
billion. This occurred for only the second time in Census history; the other
time was 1974.
    Between 2007 and 2012, per farm average value of sales increased from
$134,807 to $187,093, continuing a steady 30-year upward trend. The increase of
$52,286 was the largest rise in Census history.

Preliminary data from the 2012 Census of Agriculture also highlights national
and state farm numbers, land in farms and farmer demographics.

The 2012 Census showed principal farm operators are becoming older and more
diverse; following the trend of previous censuses. In 2012, the average age of a
principal farm operator was 58.3 years, up 1.2 years since 2007, and continuing
a 30-year trend of steady increase. The Census also accounted for more
minority-operated farms in 2012 than in 2007.
    In 2012, the United States had 2.1 million farms - down 4.3 percent from the
previous Census in 2007. In terms of farm size by acres, this continues an
overall downward trend in mid-sized farms, while the smallest and largest-size
farms held steady.
    Between 2007 and 2012, the amount of land in farms in the United States
continued a slow downward trend declining from 922 million acres to 915 million.
This is only a decline of less than one percent and is the third smallest
decline between censuses since 1950.

Conducted since 1840, the Census of Agriculture accounts for all U.S. farms and
ranches and the people who operate them. The Census tells a story of how
American agriculture is changing and lays the groundwork for new programs and
policies that will invest in rural America; promote innovation and productivity;
build the rural economy; and support our next generation of farmers and
ranchers.

"The release of the preliminary 2012 Census of Agriculture results is only a
first look at the data and we are eager to publish the final report this May,"
said NASS Administrator Cynthia Clark. "The 2012 Census was not conducted in a
typical crop year, and drought had a major impact on U.S. agriculture, affecting
crop yields, production and prices. NASS is still reviewing all 2012 Census
items to the county level and therefore data are preliminary until published in
the final report."

U.S. envoy sides with Canada   Ambassador assails Agriculture Secretary's
tactics in grain   dispute

BYLINE: DREW FAGAN, ALAN FREEMAN; GAM

LENGTH: 466 words

DATELINE: Washington, Ottawa


BY DREW FAGAN, ALAN FREEMAN
  Washington, Ottawa
DREW FAGAN, Washington
ALAN FREEMAN, Ottawa
  The Globe and Mail
 James Blanchard, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, has accused his country's
Agriculture Secretary of conducting a rogue lobbying effort aimed at
strengthening Washington's hand in its trade battle with Ottawa over grain
exports.

"I don't think he (Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy) had authority from
the President, and I don't agree with him," Mr. Blanchard said yesterday
in an interview on CBC Newsworld. "I don't fault (Canadian Trade Minister)
Roy MacLaren for being frustrated."

Mr. Blanchard, who is a friend of U.S. President Bill Clinton, spoke to
the White House and had its authorization to go ahead with the interview
before criticizing a recent trip to South America by Mr. Espy, trade
sources say.

During the trip, Mr. Espy accused Canada of predatory pricing in
shipping its grain to Brazil, and he offered to provide Brazilian
authorities with evidence of unfair trade practices by Canada that were
alleged to have kept Argentine grain out of Brazilian markets.

On his return to the United States, Mr. Espy said concern about
Canadian trade practices, which are being investigated by U.S. trade
panels, "has moved to a greater level of world scrutiny."

Sources said Mr. Blanchard sought out the television interview after
reading published reports of a speech by Mr. MacLaren on Tuesday in
Washington.

Mr. MacLaren had expressed concern that the United States was harassing
Canadian exports at the behest of such interests as Midwest farm groups,
and had sharply criticized Mr. Espy for escalating a trade battle while
both sides should be seeking a solution.

"I don't have any evidence to suggest that whatever's going on in
Brazil is something the President authorized or supports, or is even aware
of," Mr. Blanchard said yesterday.

Canada and the United States have been on the brink of a trade war for
weeks over agricultural products such as durum wheat. The United States
has formally complained about Canadian practices to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.

Canadian grain shipments to the United States have risen rapidly in
recent years because, Ottawa contends, the United States doesn't grow
enough for its own needs. Washington says much of the Canadian exports are
unfairly subsidized and are hurting U.S. producers.

Mr. MacLaren said yesterday, however, that he is more hopeful of
reaching a negotiated solution to the dispute after meeting with U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor.

In an interview, Mr. MacLaren said he, Mr. Kantor and their agriculture
ministers intend to set aside up to two days in mid-June to try to resolve
the dispute.

"I had a definite impression that Mr. Kantor is eager to gain an
agreement on grain," he said. "We both want to attempt to resolve the
question."

Agriculture Under Secretary Scuse Leads USDA Trade Mission to Southeast Asia

BYLINE: The Oakes Times staff

LENGTH: 412  words


WASHINGTON, March 4, 2015 - Leaders from six state agriculture departments and
21 U.S. agribusinesses and organizations will accompany U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Under Secretary Michael Scuse on a trade mission to Southeast
Asia from March 9 to March 13 to expand export opportunities for U.S. food and
agricultural products in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.

"U.S. agricultural exports to Southeast Asia have been on the rise thanks to
strong economic growth and increasing demand for high-value products in the
region," said Scuse, who leads. USDA's Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services
mission area. "With this growth expected to continue, the region holds
significant untapped market potential tor U.S. exporters."

"I am especially pleased to be traveling with a broad cross-section of U.S.
agricultural interests who represent every region of the country and will help
me showcase the quality, variety and abundance of farm and food products
produced for export by the United States," Scuse said.

Scuse noted that the majority of participating companies are small- or
medium-sized enterprises and many are owned by women, minorities and veterans.

The delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Manila, Philippines,
and will also meet with potential customers from Burma and Thailand while in
Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia, the Philippines, Burma and Thailand boast a combined population of 262
million. As members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), these
countries are already strong trading partners Of the United States. U.S. exports
of food and agricultural products to the four countries have doubled over the
past five years, from $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $5.4 billion in 2014.

Mission participants include a representative from GM Grain of Garrison, ND as
well as those from Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia
departments of agriculture.

USDA trade missions open doors and deliver results for U.S. exporters, giving
them the opportunity to forge relationships with potential customers and foreign
government officials, as well as to gather market intelligence that will help
them develop strategies to expand their sales in key markets overseas. The next
USDA trade mission will take place June 1 to June 5, 2015, to Panama and the
Dominican Republic. Visit

Korea still interested in restarting U.S. beef import talks

BYLINE: By Yoo Soh-jung

LENGTH: 489 words



The government said it is still keen to restart negotiations on resuming U.S.
beef imports once it receives information requested from Washington, despite a
second confirmed case of mad cow disease recently reported in the United States.

"Our position has not changed. We still plan to jumpstart negotiations on
lifting the ban on U.S. beef once we receive and review the information we asked
from the U.S. government," Kim Chang-seob, chief veterinary officer at the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, told The Korea Herald.

The government says it needs to know what type of cattle feed is used in the
United States and the location of other potentially affected cattle. The
information request was made earlier this month, during an inspection tour of
the United States by Korean officials.

Kim said the government does not know when the U.S. Department of Agriculture
will respond to the queries. Once the information is received, the Ministry of
Agriculture's livestock quarantine committee is expected to decide whether it is
safe to eat U.S. beef again, the official said.

After the conclusion of a third round of working-level talks and on-site
inspections in the United States this month, Kim said that Korea could decide to
restart formal negotiations on restarting beef imports as soon as the end of
this month.

The discovery of the brain-wasting illness bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE, at a Washington state farm prompted a total ban on U.S. beef imports in
December 2003. Until then, Korea had been among the top five importers of U.S.
beef.

In 2003, Korea imported 293,653 metric tons of beef, of which 68 percent, or
199,443 tons, came from the United States, according to government figures.

After the on-site inspections by Korean officials this month, Kim said the
government was generally satisfied with the standards of U.S. farms, butchering
facilities and livestock authorities.

Local experts have generally agreed that the United States has an effective BSE
early detection system. This includes using feed free of animal components and
the safe handling of meat so it does not get contaminated by specified nerve
tissue. The U.S. has banned the use of cattle feed containing animal parts,
which is suspected of leading to the brain-wasting illness.

The USDA said there is no evidence that the latest mad cow case involved
imported cattle, which means it is the first domestic case of BSE in the U.S.
Washington has been criticized for failing to regularly apply the "Western blot"
test, which is used in Japan and Europe to detect BSE. Mike Johanns, U.S.
agriculture secretary, assured that the BSE-positive cow had not entered the
food chain. He also said the government will now use the Western blot test, in
addition to another screening method called immunohistochemistry, or IHC, when
initial screening indicates that an animal may have the disease.

The Nation;
So Let's Just Have Veggies

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ

SECTION: Section 4; Page 3; Column 1; Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 457 words


DOES the picture at right evoke Norman Rockwell -- or Alfred Hitchcock? The
question seems a fair one in light of the scary news lately about food. Last
week the meat processor Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of possibly
tainted ground beef and shut down the Nebraska plant that it came from, causing
shortages at Burger King and Boston Market restaurants.

Only a handful of people have gotten sick from potentially deadly E. coli
bacteria in the meat, but every year in the United States, bacteria in food
kills thousands of people, mostly children and elderly people, and sickens
millions.

So a practical question for the coming weekend is, what's a Labor Day chef to
do?

Here's help from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service:

*You may think your wacky "Hot Stuff" apron is essential, but what about a meat
thermometer? Yes, a meat thermometer. The U.S.D.A. says you should use one to
make sure meat has been cooked enough to kill E. coli and other bacteria.
Hamburgers should be cooked to 160 degrees; whole poultry and thighs to 180
degrees, breasts to 170 degrees. Steaks need only be cooked to 145 degrees and
can be reddish inside since bacteria collects only on the outside of such cuts.

*Completely thaw meat and poultry before grilling so that it cooks evenly.

*Keep cold foods cold (40 degrees or lower), and hot food hot (at least 140
degrees).

*Clean all work surfaces and utensils and your hands before and after preparing
food.

*To prevent cross-contamination, make sure raw meat and poultry are separate
from other foods. Never put cooked food on a platter that held raw meat.

*Shop with summer heat in mind: put meat in the shopping cart last, just before
checkout. Meat should go in the car's air-conditioned interior -- not the trunk
-- or in a cooler for trips of more than 30 minutes.

*Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables to be eaten raw. No nibbling grapes from
the grocery bag.

*Hold the carcinogens: Some studies suggest there is a cancer risk from grilling
food at high heat. To avoid the hazardous chemicals formed by charring meat,
grill at medium temperatures. Trim as much fat as possible to avoid grill
flame-ups. Microwave precooking helps drain off fat.

*As for dangers from the grill itself, the Barbecue Industry Association says
pollution from charcoal units has been minimized with a reformulation of lighter
fluid. Among its common-sense tips: set up the grill in an open area away from
buildings. When lighting a liquid-propane grill, always keep the lid open to
prevent an explosion from built-up gas. And as for that wacky apron, make sure
its strings aren't hanging loose near the fire, or you really will be hot stuff.

Washington: Dulles CBP Seizes Hidden Horsemeat and Horse Genitals from Mongolian
Travelers

LENGTH: 596  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: U.S. Customs and Border Protection has issued the following news
release:



 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists have seen some
really unusual things in traveler baggage at Washington Dulles International
Airport over the years.  From charred full monkeys, to voodoo ceremony tools, to
cocaine concealed inside the cavity of fully cooked chickens, to live sea horses
and giant African land snails.  So it seems that after a while, the oddity is
not so odd anymore.





 Then two women arrived from Mongolia on January 29 with horsemeat concealed
inside juice boxes, including 13 pounds of horse genitals that one woman claimed
were for medicinal purposes.After they deplaned, CBP officers referred the women
for a routine agriculture examination. There, CBP agriculture specialists
discovered a combined 42 pounds of meat described as horsemeat and other
ruminant meat, including 13 pounds of horse genitals, and three liters of yak
milk.



 Horsemeat is prohibited from entering the United States if it is not
accompanied by an official government horsemeat certification from the country
or government it originates. Otherwise, CBP treats it as unknown ruminant meat
and seizes it due to fears of foot and mouth disease. Horsemeat from Mongolia is
prohibited due to concerns of introducing animal diseases to U.S. livestock
industries.



 "Customs and Border Protection takes no pleasure in seizing and destroying
travelers' food products," said Wayne Biondi, CBP Port Director for the Area
Port of Washington Dulles.  "We're in the business of protecting America's
agriculture industries, like the livestock industry, from the potential
introduction of animal diseases posed by these unpermitted food products."



 CBP incinerated all food products.



 Neither woman was criminally charged.  CBP officers released them to continue
their visit.



 Often travelers bring with them food products from their countries that is
normal to their cultures; however, some items are prohibited from the United
States and CBP will seize those products upon arrival.  CBP encourages all
travelers to learn what they can and cannot bring into the United States at
CBP's Travel website.



 "Safeguarding America's agriculture industries, and by extension our nation's
economy, remains an enforcement priority for Customs and Border Protection.  It
is a mission that we take very seriously," said Casey Owen Durst, CBP's Field
Operations Director in Baltimore, the agency's operational commander in the
mid-Atlantic region.



 CBP Agriculture Specialists have extensive training and experience in the
biological sciences and agricultural inspection. Learn more about CBP's
agriculture protection mission.



 On a typical day nationally, CBP agriculture specialists inspect over 1 million
people, and air and sea cargo imported to the United States. Those inspections
net an average of 404 agriculture pests and diseases and 4,638 materials for
quarantine, including plant, meat, animal byproduct, and soil every day.

 CBP Office of Field Operations routinely conducts inspection operations on
arriving and departing international flights and intercepts narcotics, weapons,

Latin American ministers of agriculture seeking plan for   reform, modernization

BYLINE: DAVID STEWART-PATTERSON; GAM

LENGTH: 612 words

DATELINE: Ottawa ONT


BY  DAVID STEWART-PATTERSON
 The Globe and Mail
  OTTAWA
  Developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are desperate
for reforms to international trade rules in agriculture. They are also
afraid of moving too fast.

That dilemma is at the centre of the discussions of the Inter-American
Institute for Co-operation in Agriculture this week in Ottawa.

Agriculture ministers of 31 countries in North and South America are
searching for a miraculous middle ground and hoping at least for a
consensus on how to help each other survive.

Canadian farmers can testify to the effects of the raging agricultural
trade war between the United States and the European Community, which has
depressed food prices around the world.

The effects are even worse in the debt-burdened countries of Latin
America. Low prices and trade barriers against food exports not only hurt
their ability to pay interest on their foreign debts, but undermine
economic and social stability.

Martin Pineiro, director-general of the IICA, said the agricultural
sector could be the key to short-term revival of their economies. A
failure to restore the health of Latin American farmers, on the other
hand, threatens the survival of peace and democracy in the region.

Joao Baena Soares, Secretary-General of the Organization of American
States, said developing countries are trying to boost their economic
growth by modernizing their agricultural practices. When they succeed and
produce more food, however, they face resistance to the exports that
result.

"You have many faces of the same problem," Mr. Soares said. "We have to
modernize; we have to change the structure in the agricultural activities;
we have to be able to export; we have to be able to sell the products of
our people."

Canadian Agriculture Minister John Wise agreed that agriculture is the
key to solving the broader economic problems of the region. "It must drive
the revitalization of economies in Latin America and the Caribbean."

At the same time, however, developing countries remain skeptical of
U.S. President Ronald Reagan's offer to defuse the agricultural trade ar.

Eduardo Pesqueira, Mexico's Secretary of Agriculture and Hydraulic
Resources, told the conference that the U.S. offer to end all trade-
distorting farm subsidies by the year 2000 will not work because of the
huge gap in economic development between rich and poor countries.

In the United States and Europe, he said, farm subsidies try to promote
commercial trade, while in Latin America, millions of rural poor depend on
support and subsidies from government just to survive.

"Is that the same kind of subsidies as for promotion of commerce in
industrialized countries?" Mr. Pesqueira asked.

Instead of a blanket liberalization of farm markets, "we should
negotiate step by step, maybe product by product, condition by condition,
country by country," recognizing that each country in the region is at a
different level of development and faces different problems.

The ministers who have gathered in Canada's capital recognize that
their discussions this week will not be the end of negotiations, but
rather a warmup for the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

They do hope that they can find some measures to help themselves,
without waiting for the end of the ponderous GATT process.

They expect to come up with a joint "Declaration of Ottawa" on world
farm trade, but its content will depend on reaction to the Mexican
proposal from others in the group, especially the United States.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng would not comment on Mr.
Pesqueira's proposal, saying that he had been unable to hear the speech
through the translation system.

 While in Berlin April 4-5, Vilsack will meet with German Minister of Food and
Agriculture Christian Schmidt and other government officials, as well as with an
organization of rural youth and young farmers. He will discuss how the TTIP
agreement, currently being negotiated between the United States and the European
Union, will benefit both parties' agricultural sectors by stimulating rural
economies, streamlining import procedures, providing more food choices for
consumers, addressing climate change, and increasing food security.



 Vilsack will then travel to Paris, where he will co-chair the OECD agricultural
ministerial that takes place April 7-8. He and other agriculture ministers from
OECD countries and partner economies around the world will explore how their
governments can work together to feed a growing world population, while managing
natural resources and dealing with climate change.

Got organic milk? Maybe it is, maybe not.

HIGHLIGHT: organic dairy cow's feeding practices


Aug. 11--A simmering national debate about -- of all things -- organic milk
comes to Minneapolis today, when several of the largest names in the business
gather at the Minneapolis Women's Club to talk cows, pastures and the spirit of
the organics movement.

The event will center on the question of an organic dairy cow's feeding
practices, and whether the animal is truly "organic" if it eats feed from a
trough rather than nibbling on pasture grasses.

Some farmers, especially smaller operations such as New Prague's Cedar Summit
Dairy, say cows need time to roam in a pasture to produce nutritious milk, while
some larger producers have argued that it makes the milk more expensive.

It's become a bitterly divisive debate within the organic community, spawning
boycotts of some companies and complaints to the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA), which has begun to weigh in.

The agency took public comments this summer on a proposal to make a new pasture
requirement for dairy cows to be labeled organic. The National Organic Standards
Board, a USDA advisory panel, has recommended that ruminants spend at least 120
days a year on pasture, and that 30 percent of all the animal's food come from
grazing.

A strident critic of some of the nation's largest organic dairy operations filed
a complaint Thursday with the USDA's office of compliance, charging that Horizon
Organic, owned by Dallas-based Dean Foods and one of the country's largest
organic dairy producers, does not give its cows enough pasture time. The
complaint from the Wisconsin-based Cornucopia Institute, a pro-organic consumer
association, is its fifth in two years against Horizon and Aurora Organic Dairy,
based in Boulder, Colo.

"These people have built their market share by gaming the system," said Mark
Kastel, co-founder of the institute.

A spokeswoman for Horizon defended the company Thursday, calling the allegation
"without merit." "We support active grazing for 120 days during the growing
season," Molly Keveney said.

The national standards concerning organic dairies require access to pastures,
but the rule is somewhat vague and enforcement actions are rare for violations,
according to Jim Riddle, organic outreach coordinator for the University of
Minnesota.

A provision within the regulations requires access to pastures that have edible
forage, and a second provision asks the farmer to accommodate the natural
behaviors of the animal, meaning giving cows room to graze.

"That phrase, 'access to pasture,' is where the confusion comes," said Riddle,
who until January was chairman of the National Organic Standards Board.

Horizon Organic has defended itself in the past by pointing out that more than
80 percent of its milk is produced by 342 family farms.

A statement on its website also defends the company's use of larger farms that
have as many as 10,000 animals.

"We believe organic is about a dedicated method of food production, and that
there's room in the organic movement for farms of all sizes," the statement
says.

Beef checkoff ruling affects every farmer;
15 products promoted by such programs

BYLINE: CHARLYN FARGO AGRIBUSINESS EDITOR

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 704 words


Monday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that cattle producers can be required to pay
for an industry marketing program has ramifications for every farmer in the
nation.

The justices ruled 6-3 that the beef checkoff, a mandatory $1-per-head
assessment on cattle, is constitutional. The program is best known for funding
the "Beef, It's What for Dinner" campaign. The beef checkoff is just one of a
variety of farm checkoff programs designed to promote or improve sales prospects
for a variety of agricultural products. Altogether, producers in 15 industries
paid $693 million in such mandatory fees in 2003. In the beef business alone,
producers and importers paid $83.6 million in checkoff dollars during fiscal
2003, money that supported advertising, research and education on behalf of
beef.

The beef checkoff, like many others, is operated by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.

As a result, the Supreme Court said, the generic advertising at issue is the
government's own speech. That makes it exempt from the First Amendment
free-speech challenge brought to court by an anti-checkoff group, the Livestock
Marketing Association.

"Compelled support of government - even those programs of government one does
not approve - is, of course, perfectly constitutional, as every taxpayer must
attest," wrote Justice Antonin Scalia. "And some government programs involve, or
entirely consist of, advocating a position."

Cattlemen have supported checkoff assessments since 1922. Supporters credit the
checkoff with helping increase demand for beef by more than 25 percent since
1998 and increasing the prices that producers receive for their cattle.

"We are elated," said Jim McAdams, an Adkins, Texas, cattleman and president of
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.  "Throughout the lengthy litigation
process, we believed in the merits of our case and the merits of the beef
checkoff. This is a victory for all producers who want demand-building efforts
in beef safety, nutrition and promotion continued."

Maralee Johnson, executive vice president of the Illinois Beef Association, said
the ruling is a green light to keep promoting beef.

"We're very pleased the government-speech argument prevailed," she said. "That's
because USDA has sufficient oversight of the beef program."

The ruling in the beef case will affect similar cases pending before the Supreme
Court, including the "Pork: the Other White Meat" pork checkoff and the "Got
Milk?" dairy program.

For starters, a challenge to the pork checkoff will be sent back to the lower
courts to be considered in light of the high court's ruling.

"We're very pleased with the Supreme Court's decision," said Darrell Stitzel of
Shannon, president of the Illinois Pork Producers Association. "This decision by
the highest court in the land is a victory for all commodity programs, including
the pork checkoff."

In the case of the pork checkoff, the Supreme Court's decision provides an
answer to a legal proceeding that began four years ago in Michigan.

A federal judge ruled in 2002 that mandatory collections of the pork checkoff
violated the First Amendment rights of producers who disagree with certain
messages paid for with checkoff funds. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
that decision in 2003.

Critics argued the programs support activities that favor large corporate
producers, and the checkoffs violated free-speech rights of individual farmers
who have to pay for advertisements with which they disagree.

Among checkoff critics is the National Farmers Union. NFU president Dave
Frederickson said the ruling did nothing to address issues such as
accountability to producers and access to fair checkoff referendums.

The beef promotion program raises more than $80 million a year by requiring
cattle producers to contribute $1 per animal from their cattle sales. In
addition to television and magazine ads, the program pays for research and
consumer education. The beef checkoff has stimulated the development of more
than 2,100 new beef products since 1998, supporters say.

The pork checkoff has operated since 1985. The "Pork: The Other White Meat"
campaign is one of the nation's most recognized slogans.

Who Owns This Land?

This land is not necessarily our land. The Department of Agriculture's Economic
Research Service has found that the amount of land in the United States owned by
foreigners is rising sharply.

Reports submitted to the department under the Agricultural Foreign Investment
Act show that agricultural land held by foreign interests -which represents a
potential security issue because of how it might affect the United States food
supply - increased by 369,000 acres in 1986, to 12.4 million, just under 1
percent of the total acreage.

Of that land, 70 percent is owned by companies and individuals in Britain,
Canada, West Germany, the Netherlands Antilles and Switzerland, it said.

Forestlands accounted for more than half of the foreign-owned acreage, and the
largest holdings by foreigners were in Maine, where 15 percent of agricultural
land was owned by noncitizens, mostly Canadian timber companies.

Most of the acreage in foreign hands, 79 percent, is held by corporations,
according to the department.The rest is held by partnerships, individuals,
trusts and other institutions.

US diplomat to lead trade mission to promote economic ties

BYLINE: Muhammad Arshad

SECTION: Vol. 28 No. 29

LENGTH: 304  words


The US Embassy Economic Counselor Joel Robert Garverick will lead a delegation
of senior Pakistani government officials, businessmen, farmers and agriculture
experts to Atlanta, Georgia to promote U.S.-Pakistan bilateral commercial ties
and increase trade and investment in agriculture.

The delegation will remain in the US till February 04, 2017 attend the 2017
International Production and Processing Expo (IPPE), the United States' largest
annual trade show for the poultry, meat, and feed industries, building on the
theme, 'innovation in agriculture.'

Agriculture is Pakistan's leading industry, accounting for more than twenty
percent of GDP and two-fifths of employment. Major products include cotton,
wheat, rice, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, dairy, beef, mutton, poultry and
eggs.

The United States is Pakistan's largest trading partner, exporting $447 million
in agricultural goods to Pakistan in 2015. These imports help support Pakistani
agricultural exports, which were $ 3.7 billion in fiscal year 15/16 (July-June).

Following the expo, the group will meet with U.S. agribusiness executives and
researchers, including experts at the Georgia Tech Agriculture Technology
Research Group and Innovation Lab, to explore innovations that could benefit
Pakistan, expand bilateral trade, and create investment opportunities for U.S.
companies. The group will also visit a peach farm in Georgia, and conduct
meetings with Georgia's Farm Bureau, Cotton Commission, State Department of
Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Research Service.

Representatives from all four provinces of Pakistan will take part in the trade
mission, as well as officials from the Ministry of Food Security and Research,
the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, and the Muhammad Nawaz Sharif
University of Agriculture Multan.

BRAZILIAN FRUIT EXPORTER POISED FOR US MANGO SALES USDA TO MONITOR SANITATION
PROCESS

BYLINE: JAMES BRUCE; Journal of Commerce Special

SECTION: FOREIGN TRADE, Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 589 words

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil


An increasingly aggressive Brazilian fruit exporter is about to try its hand in
the U.S. fresh fruit market.

"We are expecting major increases in (mango) production, so we are looking for
new markets," said Edmond Yedid, president of Batia Exportacao e Importacao A,
Sao Paulo.

The company intends to send its first shipment of mangoes early next week,
pending the arrival of U.S. Department of Agriculture technicians to begin
monitoring sanitation processing of the fruit.

Batia plans to export 350,000 of its 4-kilogram boxes of Haden and Tommy Atkins
mangoes to the United States by the end of February, with sales totaling $ 2
million. The target next year is to ship up to a million boxes for more than $ 5
million.

Batia's advantage will be delivering the fruit to American consumers in the
fall, winter and spring, Mr. Yedid told The Journal of Commerce.

Brazil's two mango seasons, August to November in the northeast and November to
February in the southeast, complement the Northern Hemisphere season from May to
September.

Established in 1979, Batia is Brazil's leading fruit exporter with anticipated
revenues this year of $ 16 million. Until now, Europe has accounted for 80
percent of its export sales.

Batia received authorization from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to export
mangoes to the United States in September, but the company was preparing for a
long time before that.

Since 1987 it has invested $ 300,000 in market and sanitation research. USDA
technicians monitored the research, conducted by the University of Sao Paulo
here.

The mangoes will all be shipped by air, from Sao Paulo to New York, Miami and
Los Angeles at a price of $ 1.34 a kilo.

"Unfortunately, Brazilian ports don't have the infrastructure for handling fresh
fruits," said Mr. Yedid.

Italmangesio, another company that financed half the market research and that is
also authorized by the USDA to export to the United States, canceled this year's
shipments at the last minute after a windstorm damaged fruit in its groves.

"But we are still qualified by the USDA, and the project still stands for next
year," an Italmangesio spokesman told The Journal of Commerce.

Until recently, sanitation problems blocked the sale of Brazilian fruit in the
United States. The USDA maintains a high barrier against the import of blights
that might infest American fruit trees and insects that attack fruit.

Growers in the big Sao Francisco river valley only last year met USDA sanitation
standards to begin exporting melons to the United States.

Growing environmental and health movements are also significant barriers. Brazil
exported mangoes to the United States from 1983 to 1985, treating them with a
fumigation process. Anti-insecticide restraints halted the shipments.

Batia already sells ginger to U.S. buyers. The company will sell grapes in the
United States beginning in January and the company is seeking USDA approval to
export papayas.

Batia's next target is to export mangoes to Japan.

To get a toehold in the Japanese market, Batia is investing another $ 450,000 in
further research, expected to be completed by the end of next year.

Entering the Japanese market will involve the purchase of steam treatment
equipment, required by Japanese agricultural regulations to assure sanitation of
imported fruits.

Mr. Yedid said Japan's Leyton House holding company is interested in financing
the $ 2 million equipment acquisition in return for exclusive rights to
distributing the fruit.

Regulatory update: FCC has submitted Chairman Wheeler's Response to Senators
Regarding Mobile Broadband to Support Agriculture and Rural America

LENGTH: 975  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Federal Communications Commission, The Government of USA has
published the following documents:



 ilnitnl ~tetcs ~cnetc

 WASHINGTON, DC 20510

 The Honorable Tom Wheeler, Chairman

 Federal Communications Commission

 445 12rh Street, S.W.

 Washington, DC 20554

 Dear Chairman Wheeler:



 July 11, 2016

 &middot; ertPQ RecPi,1Pr\ g .. \nsP ._, ..,

 .11 ll 1 8 2016

 FCC Mall Room

 As representatives of states with significant agricultural activity, we share
the goal of

 ensuring that access to high-quality communications networks in rural America
remains a top

 priority for the Commission.

 More than ever before, U.S. farmers and ranchers are demanding reliable,
high-speed

 mobile broadband services. Mobility is essential for new precision agriculture
technologies to

 deiiver productivity gains and environmental sustainability. These technologies
are tran~forming

 U.S. agriculture as American farmers and ranchers seek to feed, fuel, and
clothe an ever- &middot; &middot;

 increasing global population using limited land, water, and other re~ources.
&middot; &middot; .. . &middot;

 We applaud the Commission's recent decision to allow rate-of-return carriers to
access

 support for "standalone" broadband facilities. This step will help encourage
carriers to. deploy

 modem broadband-capable wireline networks in rural areas. Importantly, this is
necessary as

 consumers increasingly rely on wireless services and are "cutting the cord'' to
shift awa)' from

 wireline voice, and soaring mobile broadband relies on sufficient backhaul,
often provided by

 these wireline networks. Going forward, sufficient support must also be
available to preserve

 and expand mobile voice and broadband.

 Significant work remains to ensure that broadband services are availabie in
rural America

 and reasonably comparable to services enjoyed in urban areas. Simply stated,
broadband,

 particularly high-speed mobile broadband, is not readily available in many
rural areas or could

 be at risk absent the right policies and support through the Universal Service
Fund (USF). While

 progress has been made in the deployment of broadband, significant portions of
rural areas have

 been left behind. According to the FCC, 87 percent of rural Americans (52.2
million) lack &middot;

 access to mobile broadband with minimum advertised speeds of 10 Mbps/1 Mbps,
compared to

 45 percent of those. living in urban areas.

 Without the certainty that essential mobil~ broadband infrastructure will be
deployed and

 maintained, investments in agricultural productivity will be delayed or
bypassed altogether, and

 the potential efficiencies and benefits to rural communities will be lost. The
extension of high­

 speed mobile and backhaul facilities to a,gricultur~l croplands and ranch lands
must keep. p~ce

 ... , . .

 587

 with the ongoing deployment of technology in the field. Increasing numbers of
modems in the

 field means a growing demand for connectivity in the areas in which they
operate.

 The expansion of rural broadband should be a top priority of federal and state

 policymakers, as expanded deployment in rural areas will address important
economic,

 educational, health care, and public safety goals. Ongoing USF reform can
provide a mechanism

 for enabling mobile broadband access in rural communities where "people live,
work, and

 travel" that is truly comparable to broadband services provided in urban and
suburban areas. To

 accomplish this goal, USF should support mobile broadband at a minimum of
today's level to

 close the coverage gap while preserving existing service.

 In this regard, we ask you to give special attention as you work to establish
Phase II of

 the USF's Mobility Ftmd (MF). Given the importance of mobile services today,
the MF shouh:l

 be retained and updated to ensure that funding will promote new mobile
broadband deployment

 in unserved rural and agricultural areas and preserve and upgrade mobile
broadband where it is

 currently available. Importantly, the FCC must rely on realistic measurements
of network

 experience on the ground to determine areas to support.

 Croplands and ranch lands have lagged behind in adequate mobile coverage, even
as

 demand for coverage has grown. To address this coverage gap, we urge you to
consider a metric

 of broadband access in croplands (and farm buildings), or some other geographic
measurement,

 in addition to road miles, to identify these areas of greatest need. "Cropland"
coverage can be

 assessed using United States Department of Agriculture data for crop
operations, the United

 States Geological Survey's Land Use classification, or other databases.

 Agriculture is a significant generator of economic activity in our states. We
greatly

 appreciate your efforts to ensure that the latest mobile broadband services are
provided to all

 Americans, including those in agriculture whose livelihoods depend on it.

 Sincerely,

 United States Senator

Nations Fail to Agree on Farm Subsidies

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

LENGTH: 939 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31


Negotiators failed today to meet their deadline for figuring out how wealthy
nations can reduce their huge agriculture subsidies, the issue at the heart of a
current round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization.

The poorer nations were promised that this round of trade talks, named after
Doha in Qatar, where they began in November 2001, would especially benefit them
and require the first major reductions in what amounts to $300 billion a year in
subsidies paid by the world's richest nations to their farmers.

The developing nations have said that if these subsidies are not scaled back,
then the entire round of talks would be in doubt. That would jeopardize the
opening of markets favored by the wealthy nations, especially in services like
banking, telecommunications and information technology.

Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., issued a statement
today saying it was a "great disappointment" that the negotiators had missed
today's deadline on agriculture, but he said he thought trade officials were
committed to finding a compromise.

There is little disagreement that these subsidies are among the biggest trade
barriers for poor nations. They are blamed for depressing world grain and fiber
prices, for leading to the dumping of excess grain in wealthy nations and for
undercutting farmers in developing nations. Because agriculture is often the one
route out of poverty for some nations, the subsidies are seen as a chief reason
for the growing disparity between the haves and the have-nots.

In dispute is how the two biggest providers of subsidies -- Europe and the
United States -- will cut back the payments. If they can agree, then Japan,
Korea and Switzerland are expected to follow.

Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said today that he
was disappointed in the deadlock but played down suggestions that this was
another example of the widening gap between Washington and Europe during this
time of war.

While noting there was "a lot of sensitivity" about trans-Atlantic relations,
Mr. Zoellick said he was working very hard with his counterpart, Pascal Lamy,
the European Union's trade commissioner. Mr. Zoellick praised the European
Commission proposals to overhaul the community's agriculture.

"All of us face political difficulties in these negotiations," said Mr.
Zoellick, referring to the missed deadline at the W.T.O. "We need to help one
another work through them, seeking constructive solutions."

The European reaction was less muted. The countries of the European Union --
especially France -- have been criticized for being more attached to farm
subsidies than the United States.

Franz Fischler, the agriculture commissioner for the European Union, said today
that he, too, was disappointed and suggested that the proposal rejected at the
W.T.O. required European farmers to make greater sacrifices than American
farmers.

"If we are to make these substantial reductions to our tariffs and
trade-distorting support, we need, and want, our partners to go down this same
road," Mr. Fischler said.

The European Union subsidizes its farmers in a different fashion, placing a
stronger emphasis on environmental concerns and relying heavily on export
subsidies for their producers.

The United States has almost no export subsidies and has proposed cutting
subsidies to 5 percent of the value of farm production. Yet the 2002 farm bill
signed by the administration drastically raised permanent subsidies. Moreover,
trade negotiators are asking for an end to much of the nonemergency food aid
given by the United States, which they say is a disguised form of dumping.

The final deadline for serious negotiations on agriculture and the other
outstanding issues of this round is this September, when the trade ministers
meet in Cancun, Mexico.

By missing today's deadline, negotiators are compiling a growing backlog of
critical issues.

The W.T.O. failed to meet its December deadline to agree on a trade deal that
would help developing nations fight AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other
diseases. But the United States, with the strong approval of the American
pharmaceutical industry, exercised the veto that every nation possesses and
stopped the deal. Negotiators say they fear that a compromise will have to wait
until September.

Even though nations have yet to agree on a formula for reducing farm subsidies
and opening markets for agriculture products, the campaign against subsidies has
been hitting its mark, propelled by human rights groups, the United Nations and
even the World Bank.

President Jacques Chirac of France promised African leaders this month that he
would suspend shipments of subsidized grains to their continent.

But this was seen as a gesture, not a solution, for countries that have been
told to climb out of poverty through trade, not foreign aid. They have then
found that the free trade of food, the one commodity they all produce, is
hampered by subsidies, tariffs and export subsidies for farm products.

Mr. Zoellick is credited with pushing the reform of the trade rules for
agriculture at Doha. Trade negotiators say, however, that they are worried that
the agreement is too vague, promising "substantial reductions in
trade-distorting domestic support" that can lead to many interpretations.

At a news conference today, Mr. Zoellick said these hurdles were not
insurmountable, especially because he considered the chance to reduce subsidies
a "once in a generation opportunity."

"Trade cannot promote the development of countries across Latin America, Africa
and Asia without much freer movement of farm products," he said.

Farm program faces review

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 248 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  A Kansas legislator plans to investigate a federal farm-export program,
despite industry worries that resulting negative publicity could erode the
program's political support.

Kansas Democrat Dan Glickman said yesterday he will review the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Export Enhancement Program, under which the government gives
American exporters surplus commodities, to subsidize the cost of selling U.S.
farm products overseas.

Two recent studies say the department wasted up to US$200 million ($232.2
million) between 1985 and 1988 through excessive bonuses and mismanagement.

''The way the program is currently operated, it gives those folks who are
multimillion-dollar grain dealers a preferential hand over farmers,'' Glickman
said.

Concerned over a possible congressional backlash, the Agriculture Department has
said rules for the program will be revised within months.

The department has spent more than US$2.6 billion on the program since 1985 to
promote U.S. exports worth about US$8.9 billion. Wheat exports have accounted
for most spending by the program.

Glickman is proposing a 10-point plan to improve the program's management,
including replacing guidelines with legislation, developing better criteria for
evaluating bids and auditing individual transactions.

Although the probe will focus on program management, industry officials worry
that the debate could erode congressional support for subsidizing U.S. farm
exports.

U.S. farm aid bountiful: study   State, local subsidies keep milk, fruit,
vegetables cheap

BYLINE: OLIVER BERTIN; GAM

LENGTH: 413 words


BY OLIVER BERTIN
Agriculture and Food Reporter
Recent analyses of U.S. farm support programs by the Canadian Department
of Agriculture's policy branch show the United States has a highly
developed system of government subsidies that is among the richest in the
world.

The report, Assistance Programs for Agriculture and the Food Processing
Sector in the United States, also helps explain why milk, fruit and
vegetables are often cheaper in the United States than they are in Canada.

Take milk, a favourite item for Canadian cross-border shoppers.

The federal and state governments spent $4-billion (U.S.) on dairy
subsidies in 1989 to keep the price of milk down. And these figures
referred to a sample of only seven states.

Other subsidies keep down the price of fruit and vegetables.

California farmers received $454-million and Florida $253-million from
their state governments, much of it to defray the cost of growing winter
crops for export to Canada.

In addition, California farmers received $2-billion in crop insurance
and disaster payments, $1-billion in low-cost housing, $1.2-billion in
industrial development bonds and up to $1-billion in low-cost irrigation
water.

And those were the obvious subsidies. The authors of the report found
that U.S. farmers get the bulk of their financial assistance from a host
of "hidden" state and county programs that are often overlooked in studies
of this kind.

To find these hidden programs, the authors conducted a detailed study
of farm subsidies in 28 counties in California, Iowa, Kansas, New York,
North Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.

In 1989, farmers there were paid a total of $9.1-billion by Washington
and $3.1-billion by the states.

But the municipal and county programs were also highly lucrative. The
authors found that farmers in these seven states saved more than $2-
billion a year in property and sales tax exemptions, low-cost interest
programs and other "hidden" programs.

Most states give a break to farmers by underestimating the market value
of agricultural land when levying property taxes. For farmers in Texas,
this hidden subsidy is worth an estimated $1.2-billion a year, the authors
found.

The state of Wisconsin chooses a different route. Farmers must pay
their full property taxes, but they get $443-million back in tax credits.

Farmers also get a break when hiring farm labour. They are usually
allowed to pay less than the minimum wage, and are often exempted from
health and safety laws, compensation payments and income insurance plans.

Armed camp guards crop report secrecy

BYLINE: Maggie McNeil Reuters

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 534 words

DATELINE: Washington,DC


  At 3 a.m. tomorrow, 25 people will be locked up by armed guards in the U.S.
Agriculture Department building.

For the next 12 hours, they will not be able to talk on the telephone, look out
a window or have any contact at all with the outside world.

Before the day is over, almost 200 government employees will be confined in that
same remote corner of the cavernous building as they prepare the U.S. crop
report.

SERIOUS IMPACTS

In the report, the government will detail damage to this year's crops, which
have been hit by the worst drought in more than 50 years.

The survey, based upon inspections of thousands of fields and interviews with
farmers, is expected to show a steep drop-off in this year's corn and soybean
harvests.

The data could have serious and far-reaching impacts for the multibillion-dollar
international grain industry. The report will give government officials and
grain merchants around the world the first firm numbers on which to make policy
and trading decisions in the coming year.

Since the early 1920s, crop reports have been put together under tight security
to prevent employees from leaking information to gain a quick profit.

Advance knowledge of these reports could mean millions of dollars in profits,
since a widely anticipated report such as this week's release can jolt commodity
prices.

For example, if the government pegged the corn harvest sharply below
expectations, crop prices would probably rise in anticipation of tighter
supplies. Traders who knew the figures in advance could buy corn to sell when
the prices increased.

So the department adheres to elaborate procedures to ensure the secrecy of the
reports. ''The window shade incident started all of this,'' said Sam Rives,
deputy secretary for the Agricultural Statistics Board.

He was referring to an incident in the early 1920s involving two government
employees who had worked out a scheme to leak the information before the
official release. One employee was inside the agriculture building, helping put
together the report. The other was outside, watching the building. If the
production estimate was higher, the employee inside was to raise the window
shade. A lowered shade meant lower production.

But when statisticians gather tomorrow to put together the ''lock-up'' report,
all windows where they work will be locked and window shades sealed shut with
wires. Telephone lines will have been cut and outside computer lines shut off.

All elevators and stairwells will be locked off and sealed to prevent anyone
from leaving the lock-up area once he or she has entered it. Armed security
guards will be posted outside the two entrances to the lock-up area.

TIGHT SECURITY

The entire report, which normally involves hundreds of numbers on a variety of
crops, is compiled, double-checked and printed within the sealed area that
contains its own closed-circuit computer system and printing facility. By 3
p.m., the department will have 300 reports to distribute to anxious reporters
and government officials.

''Whatever goes in, stays in until 3,'' Rives said. ''If you accidentally get in
there, you're there for the duration.''

'Big Five grain exporters to discuss decline in prices

BYLINE: (REUTER)

SECTION: BUSINESS TODAY; Pg. D5

LENGTH: 423 words

DATELINE: LONDON


   LONDON (Reuter) - The world's major grain exporters plan to meet in
California in February to discuss falling prices and an increasingly bitter
grain trade confrontation between the United States and the European Community,
the International Wheat Council says.

The meeting, scheduled for San Diego, will be attended by agriculture ministers
from the so-called "Big Five" exporters - the United States, the 12-nation
European Community, Canada, Australia and Argentina. The group accounts for 95
per cent of world wheat trade.

The conference will be the second of its kind at the ministerial level, the
London-based wheat council said yesterday.

The first was held in June in British Columbia at Canada's request to discuss an
alarming drop in grain prices and other problems caused by grain export-subsidy
competition between the United States and Western Europe. Participants at the
conference failed to reach agreement over how to stem the price slide or on
solutions to the trade protectionism battle.

Wheat down 35%

Grain prices have plunged in the past year, with wheat down by 35 per cent,
according to wheat council statistics. World grain trade will decline 20 per
cent this year from a 1984-85 record of 104 million metric tons.

A condition for any degree of success in the February meeting will be a speedy
resolution of a dispute between the United States and the European Community
over market share, after Spain's and Portugal's accession to the EC early this
year, wheat council officials said.

The U.S. wants compensation for lost grain sales to the EC after Spanish entry,
and is angry that an interim agreement guaranteeing that Spain would import 1.4
million tons of U.S. corn by Dec. 31 has not yet been fulfilled.

"If the U.S. and EC can't resolve those bilateral trade issues, we won't get too
far in any trade negotiations, either at the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) round continuing in the new year or at San Diego," one official
said.

Talks between the EC and United States on the issue broke up in Brussels on
Sunday with both sides deadlocked. The United States has said it would impose
curbs on EC imports if no progress was made by the end of the year.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, European Agriculture Commissioner Frans
Andriessen, Canadian Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer, Australian Trade
Minister John Dawkins and Argentine Agriculture Minister Lucio Reca attended the
June meeting, and are expected to attend the San Diego conference.

Farmers to lobby Ottawa on trade deal all over again

BYLINE: Frances Phillips

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 9, ELECTION '88

LENGTH: 320 words


  Farm leaders concerned about the free trade deal with the U.S. took a
philosophical approach to yesterday's election results.

''We will just have to present our briefs again, but more strongly than
before,'' said Patty Townsend, communications co-ordinator for the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture.

''The legislation for the (free trade) bill will have to be re-entered into the
House and we will use the usual procedures to have changes made so that we can
ameliorate the damage to farmers,'' said Brigid Pyke, president of the Ontario
Federation of Agriculture.

The CFA, which represents 100,000 farmers across Canada, came out strongly
against several key issues of the agreement with the U.S.


But in the latter stages of the election campaign, federal Grains & Oilseeds
Minister Charlie Mayer, who was re-elected last night, met the organization,
''and we clarified things on both sides. We started a good consultative
process,'' Townsend said.

The CFA has also recently received assurances that broiler hatching eggs will be
added to the import control list as soon as the paperwork can be prepared.

The CFA will also return to the government with its framework for a restructured
Farm Credit Corp., which would essentially make the federal agency the lender of
last resort for beleaguered farmers.

Both the CFA and OFA lobbied on behalf of fruit and vegetable growers, who will
lose seasonal import tariffs under free trade. In the past, these tariffs have
protected producers from being swamped by cheaper, U.S. products during the
short Canadian growing season.

Pyke is also concerned that beef producers will not receive the full protection
under free trade they are looking for. She also said she believes Canadian food
processors using supply-managed products - like chicken, eggs and dairy products
- will be unable to compete with their U.S. counterparts.

House Passes Agriculture Bill

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 5, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 305 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24


The House today approved by a wide margin a $33.1 billion agriculture bill for
the fiscal year 1986 that basically maintains services at the same level as last
year.

''This shows how Congress feels about agriculture,'' Representative Jamie L.
Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said after the 354-to-71 vote. The fiscal year begins Oct. 1.

The only addition to the bill, which now goes to the Senate, was a $2 million
provision for the Government to develop and improve tests for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.

Meanwhile, President Reagan signed a bill today providing $1 billion to the
Agriculture Department, allowing it to resume making price-support loans to
farmers after a nearly weeklong cutoff. The action sent emergency money to the
Commodity Credit Corporation, which went broke last week forcing Federal
officials to halt loans to producers for their newly harvested crops. Once the
bill became law, the Agriculture Department told local offices to immediately
resume making the loans.

Mr. Whitten said the new provision of the appropriation measure was needed to
prevent AIDS from contaminating the nation's blood supply.

The bill meets the spending targets in the House-passed budget resolution for
the next fiscal year. The House and Senate are deadlocked over the budget.

The bill includes $9.2 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation, about $3
billion less than the 1985 appropriation. Expiration of certain programs would
account for the savings.

It also provides for $14.8 billion for domestic food programs, including food
stamps and child nutrition. This is $686 million more than the President wanted.

Rural development assistance would get $4.8 billion under the bill, including
$3.9 billion for the Farmers Home Administration.

COCHRAN: "WOTUS" RULE A SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY, ANXIETY & DISTRUST FOR RURAL
AREAS, FARMERS

LENGTH: 517  words

DATELINE: Washington


Office of the Senator Thad Cochran, U.S Government has issued the following news
release:

U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), ranking member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, today continued to raise red flags about the impact on agriculture
and rural economies of the new Clean Water Act regulations proposed this spring
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Accepting an invitation issued in May by Cochran and Republican members of the
Senate Agriculture Committee, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on Tuesday met
with the Senators to discuss their concerns about an assortment of environmental
regulations planned by the Obama administration and their effects on agriculture
production and rural economies.

Chief among the concerns raised by Senators representing rural communities and
agriculture is the "waters of the United States" (WOTUS) rule, which could bring
more waters under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act making them subject to
EPA permitting requirements, and the agriculture interpretive rule that outlines
specific practices which qualify producers for exemptions from regulation if
approved by U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The public comment period ends
October 20, 2014, on the proposed WOTUS regulations that were unveiled by the
EPA and Army Corps of Engineers in March, and the comment period closed on July
7 for the agriculture interpretive rule.

"The waters of the United States proposal and the agriculture interpretive rule
are a source of uncertainty, anxiety and distrust for people in rural areas.
This is particularly true for states like Mississippi whose economies are built
on agriculture production and where landowners want the peace of mind that what
they are doing is not subject to ever more regulations," said Cochran, who has
sponsored legislative measures to stop or withdraw the WOTUS proposal.

"I appreciate Administrator McCarthy agreeing to hear our concerns, and I hope
the concerns we shared on behalf of our constituents will prompt the EPA to
engage with agriculture organizations and to abandon or at least rethink some of
the regulations it wants to impose," he said.

The joint EPA-Army Corps regulatory proposal was intended to clarify a so-called
guidance document issued by the two agencies to expand the scope of the Clean
Water Act.  Since its rollout, however, concerns have grown that the WOTUS
proposal would effectively expand provisions of the Clean Water Act. The new
rule would greatly broaden government regulatory and permitting control to
additional streams, creeks, wetlands, ponds and ditches.

In June, Cochran became an original cosponsor of the Protecting Water and
Property Rights Act of 2014 (S.2496), which seeks to stop the WOTUS initiative
and prohibit the EPA and Army Corps from using the proposed rule or any
substantially similar rule or guidance document in any other rulemaking or
regulatory decision.  Earlier this month, the veteran Mississippi lawmaker also
cosponsored a similar amendment offered to the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act.

LONG ISLAND JOURNAL

SECTION: Section 11; Long Island; Page 3, Column 1; Long Island Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 922 words


SINCE the mid-1950's, the Federal Government has financed a program to control
infestations of golden nematodes in East End potato fields. Now the program is
in trouble and some potato growers are worried, since $1.7 million in Federal
funds runs out in October and the current Federal budget provides no funds for
the program next year.

The nematodes attack potato roots and lessen yields. United States Department of
Agriculture crews apply soil fumigants to fields they find are infested, and the
department then requires growers to plant varieties of potatoes that are
resistant to the microscopic pest for several seasons.

Now ''it's the Administration's feeling that the State of New York can handle
the program,'' said Harvey Ford, Agriculture Department deputy administrator. He
said the department had no plans to try to restore funds to the program.

''They are putting us in a very difficult situation,'' said Walt Brown of the
New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.  ''The Federal program is
the basis for other states and countries accepting our crops.''

Mr. Brown said that without the program there was a danger that a number of
states would place an embargo on Long Island potatoes, the cash crop that
sustains East End agriculture. He said state officials were working to get
Congress to restore funds to the program. ''We are also studying alternative
plans to keep the program going,'' he said.

Ron Leuthardt, the executive secretary of the Long Island Farm Bureau, said that
it would be important for the Federal Government to remain as the overseer even
if the state had to pay for the program.  ''The Federal Government is in a
better position to keep states that want to put up embargoes at bay,'' he said.

But even if the program ends, Mr. Leuthardt said, growers could survive, though
at a price. ''A number of our growers won't like it and it will cost money,'' he
said, ''but it's within the realm of possibility that all potatoes leaving Long
Island could be washed.''

That, he said, would eliminate the possibility that the potatoes could be
carrying nematodes.

The 21 Fresh Air Fund Friendly Town Committees on Long Island are still
accepting applications from families who are willing to be hosts to a child for
two weeks this summer. Although the responses this year are only a bit down from
last year, they aren't being made ''with the same great deal of enthusiasm as
last year - the extra food is a consideration,'' said Claudia Moriarity, the
North Shore/Suffolk County representative.

Last year 260 families participated on the Island. With more women returning to
work, a high divorce rate and a sluggish economy, Miss Moriarity is concerned
about the possibility that the decline in host families may increase. Any
families in Nassau or Suffolk Counties who are interested in being hosts to a
child for two weeks in July or August should contact Miss Moriarity at 271-7620.

Never let it be said that the big ones got away - the fish, that is. Over at
Jones Beach and Captree and Robert Moses State Parks, the Long Island State Park
and Recreation Commission is running its 23d annual fishing contest now through
Nov. 30. For rules and regulations that lead to prizes in 75 different
categories, prospective participants may check at the various boat basins or
call 669-1000, extension 247.

The Nassau Department of Recreation and Parks is running its own contests, too.
At Grant Park in Hewlett, the emphasis will be on anglers under 16 who can fish
weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. through Aug. 27. At Bay Park in East Rockaway,
age is no factor, and the hours are 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Wednesday through Aug.
25. Information may be obtained by calling 295-4337 at Grant or 593-5855 at Bay.

With the help of the Long Island Community Foundation, the Suffolk Community
Council and Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Greater New York have published the second
edition of ''Where to Secure Help,'' a 48-page pocket-size guide listing more
than 200 social and health services in Suffolk County.

The booklet, which has been distributed to police and fire departments as well
as health and social agencies in Suffolk, lists in alphabetical order agencies
and hot lines that provide information, assistance and referrals for a wide
range of problems, from alcoholism to venereal disease. Current Federal, state
and county legislators are listed in the guide also, along with their office
addresses and their telephone numbers.

''The guide is meant for the general public as well as for professionals,'' said
Thomas Chawner, the Suffolk Community Council's executive director. ''The first
edition had been distributed to bartenders as well as social agencies, and we
plan to do that again with the updated edition.''

A more comprehensive guide that lists 1,400 public and private services in
Suffolk, called the ''1982-83 Directory of Community Services,'' will be
completed by the Suffolk Community Council this month with the aid of Suffolk
County and the United Way of Long Island.

Copies of ''Where to Secure Help'' are available at the Suffolk Community
Council, 1 Edgewood Avenue, Smithtown, L.I. 11787. If one requests a copy by
mail, a $1 contribution is requested to cover postage and handling.

LENGTH: 330  words


Project budget: $7.8 million planned initially
OVERVIEW : The objective of SAAF is to strengthen education and research at
Faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Science, in Afghan universities.  SAAFs
primary partner is Afghanistans Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). Project
managers also collaborate closely with officers from the Ministry of Agriculture
, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL).


The program has provided scholarships to students working towards Masters and
Ph.D. degrees in agriculture-related subjects. Students already awarded
scholarships will receive additional support to pursue higher-level degrees in
the United States and India through 2016.
Additional scholarship awards were planned through 2016, but in 2012 USAID
curtailed awards of new scholarships as a cost-saving measure.
ACTIVITIES :
-Continued support to students already awarded scholarships to pursue
higher-level degrees in the United States and India through 2016.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS :


-Selected and sent 34 Afghan professionals from six Agriculture Faculties and
Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) for Masters and Ph.D.
degrees in the United States and India.
-Eight professors have graduated with MS degrees from U.S. universities. Six
from Purdue University and two from North Carolina State University.
-Thirteen professors have finished their post graduate studies from universities
in India. Six from the University of Horticultural Sciences and seven from the
University of Agricultural Sciences.
-All graduates have now returned to Afghanistan and resumed their professional
activities with either the MoHE or the MAIL.

China: Pine pallets must be treated

BYLINE: BY JACK LUCENTINI

SECTION: WORLD TRADE; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 406 words


U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said they are available to help
exporters comply with a new Chinese rule requiring imported packing materials
made of U.S. pinewood to be heat-treated.

The Chinese regulation comes a year after the United States, in a bid to prevent
the spread of a voracious wood-boring beetle, imposed similar requirements on
wooden crates and pallets from China.

Chinese officials announced the rule on Nov. 1, saying it was necessary to
prevent the spread of the pinewood nematode, a tiny parasite associated with
pine wilt disease.

""The U.S. Department of Agriculture is prepared to work together with exporters
and the Chinese government to ensure there is a minimal disruption to trade,''
said Michael V. Dunn, undersecretary for the USDA's marketing and regulatory
programs.

China's heat-treatment requirements, which will apply to shipments from the
United States and Japan, will start on Jan. 1.

The USDA cited reports saying the pest has been intercepted 44 times in U.S.
shipments to China since October 1998, and that it has been found in five
provinces of China.

A pest risk assessment has been prepared by the Chinese government addressing
the issue, said U.S. Agriculture officials.

China is the latest addition to the list of countries, including the United
States and Canada, that regulate solid wood packing material to prevent the
introduction of pests.

The Chinese rule covers wood packing materials made of U.S. conifers, a class of
mostly cone-bearing evergren trees that includes pines and cypresses.

Exporters seeking more information about the rules can call the USDA's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service at (301) 734-8295. The pinewood nematode is
a microscopic worm that is carried from tree to tree by pine sawyer beetles. The
nematode feeds on the pine trees, which then turn brown and die, usually within
a year.

The nematodes eat the fungi that invade the dead tree; finally, their larvae
enter the trachea of beetles, which carry them to a new tree.

The pest has been found in 36 U.S. states, according to Kansas State University
researchers, who say its widespread distribution here suggests it is native to
the United States.

The pest was discovered in China in 1982, but it has not spread much,
researchers with the Chinese Academy of Forestry, said in a paper for the
International Symposium on Pine Wilt Disease in Beijing in 1995.

MEAT-IDENTIFICATION TEST PAVES WAY FOR IMPORTS

SECTION: COMMODITIES, Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 298 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


The recent removal of a 70-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture ban on the
import of ground meat to the United States should raise demand for fast,
reliable methods to identify and verify the species content of raw ground meat.

In fact, the availability of user-friendly tests, which facilitate such meat
speciation," helped pave the way for the lifting of the import ban.

Cortecs Diagnostics Ltd. of Deeside, U.K., has developed an easy-to-use test
being marketed in the United States under the trade name DTEK Immunostick, Raw
Meat Species Screening Test Kit. ELISA Technologies Inc. of Alachua, Fla.,
markets the test kits in the United States and Canada.

The DTEK Immunostick kits provide government regulatory bodies and the meat
industry with a quick ( 1/2 hour), accurate means of determining the species
composition of uncooked meats. Other test methods take longer, are less accurate
and are more difficult to carry out, its developers say.

With the DTEK test, users are now able to identify the presence of particular
meats comprising as little as 1 percent of a ground meat mixture.

The accuracy and ease of use of DTEK Immunosticks led to their being recommended
for "immediate implementation" for raw meat species determinations at all of the
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service laboratories.

DTEK Immunosticks test for the presence of beef, horse, pork, sheep/goat,
poultry, rabbit, water buffalo, goat, chicken, turkey, deer and even kangaroo
meat.

United Kingdom-based Cortecs Diagnostics is a subsidiary of Cortecs
International Ltd. In addition to its diagnostics and pharmaceutical marketing
operations, Cortecs International also is involved in the development of unique
drug delivery systems for a wide variety of pharmaceuticals.

JAPAN SEES NOTHING NEW IN US ATTACK ON IMPORTS

BYLINE: A.E. CULLISON; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: EXPORTS, Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 540 words

DATELINE: TOKYO


A senior government official Wednesday described the latest U.S. demand to
liberalize beef and citrus import controls was nothing new, but added: Now we
know they mean business.

At the same time, the government said it will cut government support prices f
beef and pork, Agriculture Ministry sources said.

The maneuvering over beef comes a few days before the current, four-year- old
agreement on U.S. beef and citrus fruit exports to Japan is set to expire.

The United States today sells about $ 700 million worth of American beef in
Japan as well as $ 150 million worth of oranges, grapefruit and other citrus
fruit.

The United States wants Japan to eradicate or at least phase out those import
limits, saying it likely could vastly increase its beef and fruit exports. But
Japan, seeking to protect its domestic ranches and orchards, wants to negotiate
a new set of import quotas.

U.S. Trade Represe ntative Clayton Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said in Washington on Tuesday that if the United States and Japan fail to
reach agreement, the United States will file a formal complaint with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. GATT, as the 95-nation body is known, governs
most worldwide commerce.

In Tokyo on Wednesday, the Agriculture Ministry official called the threat by
Mr. Yeutter and Mr. Lyng nothing new because they had been implied for several
months.

The only change, he said, is that now we know they mean business.

The ministry spokesman talked to reporters the same day Japan's ruling
Liberal-Democratic Party rejected the U.S. demand on beef and citrus.

Koichi Kato, leader of an LDP agriculture panel and member of Japan's House of
Representatives, said his group was angry with the tough U.S. stance and agreed
not to yield to pressure from the United States.

He added that politicians and farmers who dislike conceding imports to the
United States believe Japan should take up its fight before GATT.

It was clear to the Japanese government, however, that if the United States does
finally take the problem to GATT there is an excellent chance the Geneva-based
group will rule against Japan.

In a similar dispute last autumn, a multilateral GATT panel decided that
Japanese import curbs on 10 categories of agricultural products violated
international free trade regulations. A review panel upheld that ruling last
month.

While the government appears uncertain of what to do on beef and citrus imports,
it does seem more sure of itself on agricultural prices.

Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato told a ministry advisory group that he wanted
to lower the stable price zones of beef and pork, on which wholesale prices are
based, by 4.3 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively.

U.S. officials sounded pessimistic about their prospects for agreement when they
discussed the issue earlier this week.

There's certainly nothing at the moment that would indicate we're anywhere near
a resolution, Mr. Yeutter said.

Mr. Lyng estimated that without quotas, beef exports to Japan would double in
the next few years and citrus exports would show a substantial increase.

He noted that sirloin steak costs $ 4.99 a pound in Washington and $ 20.56 a
pound in Tokyo.

Report will be bullish for Chicago soybean prices

BYLINE: Farm Market News

SECTION: SECTION 2, INVESTMENT AND FINANCE; Pg. 18, FARM COMMODITIES

LENGTH: 283 words

DATELINE: Winnipeg,Man.


Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and Winnipeg Commodity Exchange were
sidelined for the better part of yesterday awaiting the publication of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's planted acreage and grain stocks reports.

The report, made public after the close of trading, was termed bullish for CBOT
soybean prices today, and bearish for both corn and wheat prices.

The department estimated U.S. farmers seeded 58.045 million acres of land to
soybeans in 1990. This is at the low end of pre-report estimates and could
ultimately create a soybean shortage. Total U.S. soybean stocks as of June 1,
1990 were pegged at 595.91 million bushels.

Corn plantings were at the higher end of pre-report guesses while the corn
stocks forecast was within market expectations.

U.S. wheat stocks as of June 1 totaled 535 million bushels, well above the
highest guess of what the trade had anticipated.

CBOT corn prices closed US2 1/2 cents to US8 1/4 cents a bushel higher. The most
active contract, September, settled at US$2.89 1/4, up US4 3/4 cents.

Continued concerns about the impact of intense heat on the U.S. corn crop drove
futures higher.

Wheat prices at the CBOT ended US1 1/2 cents to US3 cents lower. September
closed at US$3.35 1/4 a bushel, down US2 1/4 cents.

Sluggish export demand and an active harvest pace pressured wheat futures.

Poor exporter demand as well as the lack of fresh buying incentives pushed
flaxseed prices at the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange lower.

WCE flaxseed closed $2 to $10 a metric ton lower. The most active contract,
October, settled at $314.20, down $2. The most the flax contract can move in a
single day is $10.

Nash County Farmer Sentenced In Federal Crop Insurance Fraud Scheme

LENGTH: 432  words

DATELINE: Raleigh


United States Attorney's Office for the eastern District of North Carolina has
issued the following press release:

United States Attorney Thomas G. Walker announced that in federal court on April
6, 2015 CLAY TAYLOR STRICKLAND, 74, of Spring Hope, North Carolina, was
sentenced by Chief United State District Judge James C. Dever III, to 6 months
imprisonment to be followed by 3 years of supervised release.  STRICKLAND was
ordered to make restitution in the amount of $233,559 to the United States
Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency and $64,856 to the United
States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency.  STRICKLAND was also fined
$10,000.  STRICKLAND previously pled guilty to conspiring to make false
statements, to make material false statements, to commit mail fraud and wire
fraud, and to structuring transactions all in violation of Title 18, United
States Code, Section 371 and aiding and abetting the making of false statement
in connection with the Federal Crop Insurance Program, in violation of Title 18,
United States Code, Section 1014.

Mr. Walker stated, "As a farmer, STRICKLAND understood the importance of the
federal crop insurance program as a safety net to the community in times of
disaster and yet, he stole from that same program.  The sentence imposed today
reflects the seriousness of his offense and should serve as a deterrent for
others."

The Criminal Information, filed on October 2, 2014, alleges that STRICKLAND was
engaged in the business of farming, doing business as Clay T Strickland Farms,
Inc.  The Information goes on to allege that STRICKLAND filed a false crop
insurance claim in that he hid tobacco production from USDA by selling tobacco
for cash to a tobacco warehouseman who then sold the tobacco in nominee names.
STRICKLAND profited under the scheme because he was paid twice for each pound of
tobacco; once through the false crop insurance claim and also from the sale of
the "hidden" tobacco for cash.  To conceal the conspiracy, STRICKLAND made false
statements to law enforcement officers during the investigation.

Investigation of this case was conducted by the United States Department of
Agriculture - Office of Inspector General, Investigations; the United States
Department of Agriculture - Risk Management Agency, Special Investigations
Branch, and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigations.  Assistant
United States Attorney Banumathi Rangarajan served as prosecutor for the
government.

UNSCHEDULED AIR, SEA ARRIVALS FACE NEW USDA ADVANCE NOTICE RULES

BYLINE: Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: AIR, Pg. 5B

LENGTH: 511 words


Unless regularly scheduled, airlines will have to notify U.S. Department of
Agriculture at least 12 hours before foreign flights land in the United States
beginning Feb. 1.

The new rule also requires at least 12 hours' notice for ships arriving at U.S.
ports from abroad, said Charles A. Havens, the USDA's chief operations fficer,
port operations.

The USDA implemented the new rule, Mr. Havens said, because certain companies
declined to notify it of vessel and aircraft arrivals from foreign nations. Now
we can enforce the arrival notification, he said. The rule ensures that USDA
inspectors will be present to prevent cargo from entering the United States that
may carry diseases and pests that could threaten U.S. agriculture, he said.

Airline and vessel operators must notify the USDA about all foreign ports where
the craft has picked up crew, passengers or cargo destined for the United States
since the craft's last visit to the United States, he said.

All airlines with flights scheduled in the North American and Worldwide editions
of the Official Airline Guide are exempt from the new rule, Mr. Haven said. The
USDA accepts the published schedules as first notification, he said.

However, a USDA port office must be notified if the estimated time of arrival
changes by more than one hour, he said.

Also exempt are pre-cleared aircraft and craft that do not regularly transport
passengers or cargo for a fee, he said.

Some airline officials viewed the new rule as an annoyance.

This just means another telephone call to let these people know that we've got a
plane coming in, said Tom Ray, liaison to the Federal Aviation Administration
for San Francisco-based World Airways.

Mr. Ray said some carriers would find notifying USDA regarding the contents of
an aircraft's cargo difficult. You're going to have to call customer service to
find what the hell is in the airplane, he said.

Even if the ruling did affect regularly scheduled airlines, the effect on many
of them would be minimal, according to a New York-based Swiss Air official.

We can call up on computers the manifests of what is loaded aboard a plane, the
official said. With a six-hour time difference between the U.S. East Coast and
Switzerland, New York-based Swiss Air officials would have 14 hours' notice, the
official said.

However, if immediate communication were needed, there would be a problem, he
said. For example, if an aircraft was due to arrive in New York at 3 p.m., no
one could be reached in Switzerland because it would be 9 p.m. and no staff
would be available, he said.

Richard Owens, cargo manager for Arrow Air Inc., said 12 hours' notice would not
be enough time for this Miami-based carrier.

We send planes out to Santo Domingo and we come back in only a few hours, he
said. Arrow offers cargo service to the Caribbean and points in South America
using four DC-8 aircraft, Mr. Owen said.

Arrow will comply with the new rule, he said, but added the carrier hopes to
work something out with USDA officials to avoid problems.

LENGTH: 198  words


People from around The United States and Canada celebrated World Food Day on
Thursday, Oct. 16. The continent-wide celebration was intended to bring
attention to the food needs around the world being met by family famers across
North America.

The theme for the 2014 World Food Day was "Family farming: feeding the world,
caring for the earth" According to the website www.worldfooddayusa.org, over 98
percent of farms in the world are family farms.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organizations of the United Nations
estimates that of all agricultural production in the United States, 84 percent
is grown on family farms totaling more than $230 billion in sales annually.

As part of the World Food Day celebration Unites State Secretary of Agriculture
Tom Vilsak said American farmers are an integral part of ending hunger.

"While they are not always fully appreciated and recognized for their capacity
to address these challenges, I believe the role that agriculture and family
farmers can play is significant," said Vilsak.

World Food Day is celebrated on October 16, in honor of the founding day of the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which was October 16,
1945.

FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS;
Killer Bees

BYLINE: By Richard Haitch

SECTION: Section 1; Part 2; Page 37, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 261 words


Like a menacing thunderhead, the African ''killer'' bees appeared suddenly in
news reports in the late 1970's. They were portrayed as savage creatures, prone
to attack animals and humans in great swarms and with greater tenacity than
European bees, common in North America. Somehow they had made their way from
Africa to Brazil.  Inevitably, biologists warned, they would spread north.

The predictions then were that the African bees would reach the United States by
the 1990's.  They are on schedule - ''they're reported now in Panama,'' says
Hachiro Shimanuki, national technical adviser on bees to the United States
Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Md.

Positive identification in Panama was made last March, Dr.  Shimanuki says. From
there the African bees are expected to move through the rest of

Central America into Mexico, then into the United States.  Dr. Shimanuki looks
for their arrival in this country by natural migration ''probably in the early
1990's.'' But it could be sooner, he observes, if the bees slipped in unnoticed
by ship.

One such attempt has already been made but has not been widely publicized.
Philip Lima, a specialist with the Federal Animal Plant Health Inspection
Service in Hyattsville, Md., says the service found two hives of African bees on
an oil tanker from Venezuela when the ship docked at Corpus Christi, Tex., in
March 1979.

The bees were exterminated, Mr. Lima says.

SOVIET UNION IS FACING ANOTHER POOR HARVEST

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANSBy JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

SECTION: Section D; Page 1, Column 1; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 977 words

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 27


The Soviet Union appears to be heading for its sixth poor grain harvest in a
row. After a summer of hot, dry weather in some areas and unusually heavy rain
in others, a cold snap now threatens to cut short the Siberian growing season.

With about half of this year's crop harvested, the United States Agriculture
Department earlier this month revised its projection for the 1984 Soviet harvest
downward to 180 million metric tons, from 190 million, and it estimated that the
Russians would have to import 43 million tons of grain, only three million less
than the record total in 1982. The official target for the 1984 harvest is 240
million tons.

The estimate comes at a time when heavy Soviet purchases of grain from the
United States have already re-established America as a major supplier a year
after the ending of the curb imposed by President Carter in response to the
Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan. The United States and the Soviet
Union signed a five-year grain agreement on Aug. 25, 1983.

The Soviet Union is also buying heavily from France, Canada and other grain
producers.

The Soviet Union has not approached its crop target since the record of 235
million tons was set in 1978. Its best harvest since then was last year's 190
million tons.

This year the crucial July rainfall that farmers count on did not come to
western Kazakhstan, the Urals, the north Caucasus and the Volga River basin. The
parched crop is expected to be well below what they had hoped.

Meanwhile, heavy rainfall has hurt the quantity and quality of the crop in the
western and north-central Ukraine and western Russia.

Now the early cold weather that moved in over the weekend from the Baltic Sea is
chilling the northern half of the country as far south as the Ukraine, with
temperatures dropping toward freezing.

In Moscow, children who were running barefoot in the grass only two days ago
have appeared in woolen leggings, with knitted hats tied snugly around their
chins. In the Urals, where harvesting is still under way, frost has already been
reported. In Siberia, where the harvest is just beginning, the cold weather
could damage the ripening crop.

Cold autumn weather can also bring rainfall that reduces the quality of the
harvest by knocking the grain off the stalks and causing mold in the cut grain.
If the weather is cold, a wet harvest dries more slowly.



Soviet Press Coverage

Meanwhile, the Soviet press is beginning to acknowledge the problems that a lack
of rain has brought in other areas.

In the first official confirmation that conditions have been bad in the Kazakh
farm belt, a local newspaper has reported that the crop is stunted and is
proving difficult to harvest. Kazakhstanskaya Pravda said in its issue of Aug.
18, which recently reached Moscow, that this year's harvest had developed amid
extremely complicated conditions in every part of Kazakhstan, which usually
produces about 27 million tons of grain, or 14 percent of the Soviet total in
recent years.

The newspaper also reported that poor maintenance had idled many of the badly
needed harvesting machines. Throughout the Soviet press, as in other harvest
seasons, there have been complaints of inefficiency, poor management and faulty
equipment. Such problems are seen by Western experts as more or less normal for
Soviet agriculture. The weather, one of them said, either exaggerates these
built-in problems or overcomes them when there is a really good year, such as
1978.

Soviet Buying Pattern




WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 - According to the Agriculture Department, the Soviet Union
has purchased 14.3 million metric tons of American wheat and corn in this crop
year, which ends Sept. 30. This includes a 100,000-ton purchase of wheat today.

Of the total, 7.5 million tons is wheat and 6.6 million is corn. The Russians
have also purchased 416,200 tons of soybeans.

Their record purchase from the United States was 15.5 million metric tons in the
1978-79 crop year, and many analysts expect they will top that this time. A
metric ton, or 1,000 kilograms, is about 2,205 pounds.

Under the five-year grain agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet
Union a year ago, the Kremlin was to buy a minimum of 9 million tons a year and
a maximum of 12 million tons. This range was up from the limits of 6 million to
8 million tons set in the earlier agreement.

The present pact stipulates that the Russians notify Washington if they want to
buy more. This provision harks back to the heavy Soviet buying of American grain
in 1973 that drove up domestic prices in the United States.



Comment by President

Last week President Reagan indicated that such added purchases would be no
problem. ''If they want to buy more,'' he said, ''we'll sell them more.'' He
made this remark at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia.

The United States Government has already approved a waiving of the 12-
million-ton limit for the 1984-85 year. The new limit adds 10 million tons,
bringing the maximum possible purchase for this year to 22 million tons,
according to Jeffrey Idleman, assistant to the Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture for Economics.

In addition, the Russians already have bought 1.3 million metric tons of wheat
for delivery in the 1984-85 year, which begins Oct. 1, and 6.6 million metric
tons of corn. A consultation on the grain agreement is scheduled for October,
which could be an occasion for the Russians to ask for a waiver of the
12-million-ton limit for 1984-85.

Such an announcement at that time by President Reagan could help his re-election
campaign among farmers, many of whom have been hurt by high interest rates.

Since the present agreement was signed, Moscow has bought a total of 22.2
million metric tons of wheat and corn for delivery this year and next.

U.S. begins to lift ban on beef: Animals still not allowed across border

SOURCE: National Post

BYLINE: Mary Vallis

SECTION: News; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 672 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON - The Bush administration partially lifted its ban on Canadian beef
yesterday, marking a major step forward in Canada's struggle to recover from the
mad cow crisis that is said to be costing the industry $11-million a day.

The border will remain closed to live animals, but the U.S. Department of
Agriculture has lifted its sanctions on meat from cattle under the age of 30
months, veal from calves younger than 36 weeks and fresh or frozen beef liver.

Beef could begin crossing the border by September, as soon as the first import
permits are approved, Ann Veneman, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, said
yesterday.

The USDA will immediately begin accepting applications.

"I cannot stress strongly enough that the continued protection of the U.S. food
supply is our top priority," Ms. Veneman said.

"Our experts have determined that the risk to public health is extremely low."

The complete list of products that will be allowed across the border -- which
also includes young sheep and goat meat, pet products that contain animal
protein, and wild game -- represents roughly half of the beef products Canada
usually exports to the United States.

The USDA is also working on an expedited process for the importation of live
cattle to the United States from Canada so the remaining restrictions can be
lifted.

"This represents a significant first step in resuming trade in beef and cattle,"
Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister, said in a statement.

"This decision is testimony to the high standards to which the Canadian beef
industry operates."

Mr. Chretien urged other countries to follow the United States' lead and
immediately lift their trade barriers.

Almost three dozen countries imposed a ban on Canadian beef after scientists
found a lone case of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
in Alberta on May 20. The United States imposed its ban the same day; Canada has
been struggling to persuade the world its beef is safe ever since.

Lyle Vanclief, the federal Agriculture Minister, said the decision by the USDA
to lift some sanctions is a "good start."

"Government officials and industry have worked very hard to get this far. Our
job is not done yet," he stressed. The announcement marks the first time any
country affected by BSE has been successful in marketing its beef products into
a country that has not been affected by the disease, he added.

Officials in the United States acknowledged Canadian beef is safe following a
joint Canada-U.S. investigation. The United States was prepared to ease its
restrictions, but ran into problems with two of its major trading partners --
South Korea and Japan, the chief importer of U.S. beef. They pressured
Washington to institute additional measures that would prove any beef products
they imported from the United States did not originate in Canada.

Tokyo demanded a system be put in place by Sept. 1. U.S. and Japanese officials
met this week to develop a suitable "segregation" system.

Under the new "beef export verification program," beef producers and suppliers
can opt to pay a fee and receive documentation their meat was raised in the
United States. The program will be running by Sept. 1, Japan's deadline, even
though the United States "does not feel that the science justifies these
requests," Ms. Veneman said.

Japan is the chief importer of U.S. beef and South Korea is No. 3, so the United
States complied to avoid economic harm, she explained.

"We do not feel such a program is necessary," she told reporters. "It could have
been avoided if there were a more practical, risk-based approach to trade with
countries such as Canada that have had only isolated occurrences of BSE and have
responded aggressively, with appropriate mitigation measures."

The United States, Mexico and Japan are the top three importers of Canadian
beef. Canada provided $1.8-billion of beef products to the United States in
2002, 87% of its export market. Japan imported $81-million worth of Canadian
beef.

TURKEY, US NEAR END TO WHEAT ROW USDA SAYS COUNTRIES ARE "BACK ON TRACK'

BYLINE: JONATHAN EWING; JOURNAL OF COMMERCE SPECIAL

SECTION: COMMODITIES, Pg. 7B

LENGTH: 361 words

DATELINE: ISTANBUL


The United States and Turkey Wednesday appeared close to resolving a dispute in
which Ankara had virtually banned U.S. wheat and other grains sales to Turkey
over the past four weeks, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture officials.

U.S. officials said they regarded the ban as an unfortunate incident, which
should have been avoided. ''We're very pleased to be getting back on track,''
one spokesman said.

The row between Turkey and the United States began in October, after the Turkish
Ministry of Agriculture ordered U.S. wheat cargoes to be held for inspection
against ergot fungus - a substance not considered by the United States to be
harmful if consumed by humans.  The Agricultural Ministry declared that U.S.
wheat that contained ergot would no longer be acceptable, and declared a zero
tolerance of the fungus in all internationally produced wheat, as well as zero
tolerance for Tilletia controversa (TCK) and Urosistas - both plant diseases.
''None of them present a risk when consumed by humans,'' said Jonathan Jones,
export program manager for USDA.

''And TCK and Urosistas, if used for agricultural production can cause damage
because they are plant diseases, but in this case they were not for crops, they
were strictly for human consumption.''

And independent analysts are calling the Turkish zero tolerance regulation a
reaction to an earlier decision made by the Ministry of Agriculture which set
support prices for domestically produced wheat. The ministry had set the price
at $ 260 per ton - much higher than the world price for wheat.

''The end result is that Turkish wheat was not as competitively priced as
American wheat, and the Turkish consumers were forced to pay for the
difference,'' said Petek Coskun, an analyst with the Istanbul-based IBS Research
& Consultancy.  Turkey remains the second largest growing agricultural market
for U.S. farmers after China. In 1995, U.S. agricultural exports totaled just
over $ 500 million, according to USDA officials. If approved, the new policy
will allow for the presence of ergot, TCK and Urosistas in international grains
at no higher than five parts per 10,000.

EARLY potato prices in Great Britain eased last week as, in the drier weather
conditions, more growers were lifting.

Prices for early season chipping material remained firm, according to the
British Potato Council.

Meanwhile, in the United States, the autumn potato acreage is reported to be
down compared to last week.

The National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United States Department of
Agriculture released its report on Crop Production on Friday.

According to the report, a total of 1,114,400 acres was planted with potatoes in
the autumn-producing states this year (1,144,200 acres were planted last year).
This is 2.6 per cent below last year's plantings.

Corn growers forecast a slump in prices

The National Corn Growers Association is forecasting that continuing economic
problems in East Asia will have an adverse impact on U.S. corn prices in 1998.

The St. Louis-based Corn Growers warn that America's corn, soybeans, wheat and
other grains and crops are twice as dependent upon exports as the rest of the
U.S. economy. Foreign exports now account for 30 percent of all farm sales, they
said.

Asia is also the largest single market for U.S. farm goods and, until the
current economic crisis, the fastest-growing market as well.

In 1997, Asia purchased nearly $ 24 billion from America's farmers, or 42
percent of all farm goods.

Citing ''conservative'' estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
Corn Growers said the Asian financial crisis could cut $ 500 million in American
farm exports this year.

Farm trade deal with U.S. elusive

BYLINE: Peter Morton

SECTION: SECTION 1, NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 429 words


Canadian and U.S. negotiators are still trying to find common ground in several
key areas of a comprehensive farm trade deal, industry and government sources
close to the talks said yesterday.

Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy
held talks over the weekend to try to find acceptable quotas on the export of
Canadian grain, sugar and peanuts to the U.S.

Goodale told the Commons yesterday he could not detail where the negotiations
were but promised to protect the interests of Canadian farmers.

The last-minute snags in talks aimed at sorting out disputes in five agriculture
-related areas is typical strategy of the U.S. negotiators, said one former U.S.
trade official.

''The closer a deal is, the harder the U.S. will push to see how anxious the
other side is in getting a deal,'' the official said.

Besides export limits on grain, sugar and peanuts, the U.S. is pushing hard to
eliminate the proposed 100% tariffs on processed food products such as yogurt
and ice cream over six years. Goodale has proposed lowering those tariffs by 36%
over six years and then eliminating them over another four years.

But one U.S. source said the U.S. would probably agree to a 10-year phase-out on
ice cream and yogurt if the proposed tariffs on all supply-managed farm products
- including eggs, chicken, cheese and other dairy products - followed the same
schedule.

In December, Canada and other countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade agreed to replace by next July all existing import quotas with tariffs and
reduce those by a minimum of 15% over six years. Those tariffs are to go to GATT
by Feb. 15 for final approval.

Goodale and Espy do not see eye to eye on how much market access each country is
to receive in dairy products, said one U.S. official. Canadian negotiators have
offered to exchange 5% of the Canadian market to get 3% of the U.S. market.

Canadian dairy farmers have said they would be content with 3% of the huge U.S.
market but want assurances they would not be hit with anti-dumping charges since
Canadian domestic prices would be higher than those on exports to the U.S. In
international trade, dumping occurs when products are sold in a foreign market
at prices below those in the domestic market.

The U.S. is also balking at a Canadian proposal it had once tentatively accepted
to limit for three years Canadian wheat and grain exports to the U.S. to 2.5
million tonnes, the record amount of grain shipped to the U.S. last year, said
one industry source.

P.E.I. vows fight over U.S. ban

LENGTH: 119 words


Prince Edward Island Agriculture Minister Keith Milligan met with Federal
Agriculture Minister Don Mazankowski Friday to discuss the U.S. ban on P.E.I.
and New Brunswick potatoes. ''We might have to fight fire with fire by banning
some U.S. products to Canada if the ban is not lifted immediately,'' Milligan
said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it banned potato imports from
P.E.I. and New Brunswick because of a virus affecting some seed potatoes.
Milligan said the ban is a case of ''protectionism.'' Potatoes are P.E.I.'s
major industry, worth about $125 million last year. Growers there say the ban is
devastating, since the U.S. traditionally buys 30% of P.E.I. seed potatoes sold.

DOMINICAN POSITION ON SUGAR QUOTAS

SECTION: Section A; Page 14, Column 3; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 261 words


To the Editor:

A news article on May 22 considered the effects of the sugar quotas recently
announced by President Reagan on the Dominican Republic.

In our view, it is less than accurate to headline that ''Dominicans Fear Sugar
Quotas.'' Moreover, the concluding comment (about lobbying to end the quotas)
misrepresents the official position taken by the Dominican Republic before
Congress, the United States International Trade Commission and the United States
Department of Agriculture.

Statements to Congressional committees by the Dominican Republic's International
Sugar Policy Coordinating Commission have emphasized that we support Mr.
Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative sugar quota allocation of 780,000 metric
tons, duty free.

Statements to the Trade Commission and the Agricultural Department have argued
that, if a protective mechanism is considered necessary, quotas without duties
and fees would be preferable to duties and fees. Quotas are considered to be
less damaging to the interests of foreign suppliers to the U.S. market and, at
the same time, a more effective protective mechanism for this market.

With the establishment of quotas, fees no longer have any regulatory effect on
the U.S. market. The current, highly restrictive quota adversely affects the
Dominican sugar industry and economy because it keeps our exports to the U.S.
market substantially below our historical supply levels. It also maintains what
to us are punitive duties and fees.
RAFAEL MOLINA MORILLO, Ambassador of the Dominican Republic, Washington, June
16, 1982

Block Depicts Reagan As Sensitive to Farms

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 15, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 159 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7


Agriculture Secretary John R. Block said today that President Reagan did not
mean to suggest that only a handful of farmers were having critical problems
with cash flow.

''The President understands the problem in agriculture,'' Mr. Block told
reporters.

In remarks accompanying the veto of an emergency credit bill Wednesday, Mr.
Reagan said: ''In need of immediate help are less than 4 percent, or around 4
percent at best, of all the farmers in the United States. Ninety- six percent do
not have liquidity problems.''

According to Agriculture Department economists, about 8 percent of ''family-size
commercial farms'' with sales of $40,000 to $500,000 annually have debts in
excess of 40 percent of their assets and are in a severe cash- flow squeeze.

Mr. Block said: ''What he was really saying is that he feels that we will
probably lose about 5 percent or 4 percent. He wasn't suggesting there aren't
more than that in trouble.''

'81 WHEAT SUPPLY IS UP, BUT FEED STORAGE IS LOW

BYLINE: By SETH S. KING, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 2, Column 5; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 476 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27


American farmers are expected to have in storage at least a year's domestic
supply of wheat when the 1981 harvest begins in June, the Agriculture Department
reported today.  But it said carry-over stocks of feed grains would be the
lowest since 1976.

The estimate of wheat reserves was reassuring in view of the extremely dry
seasonal weather that has left this year's winter wheat crop with very little
snow cover and highly vulnerable to freezing February temperatures.

In its January supply and demand estimate, the Agriculture Department noted that
reserve wheat stocks were larger than last year but if the rate of wheat exports
continued these stocks would be at about 24.5 million metric tons.

The United States was expected to use about 22.9 million tons for bread and
livestock feed during the crop year that will end next June.

With the total world grain supply now at one of the lowest levels since 1974,
foreign demand for American wheat is expected to pull exports up to a record 66
million tons by June 1, the department said.

It said it expected feed grain stocks to drop to only 21.4 million tons before
the new crops are harvested early next fall. This was less than half of the 52.4
million tons carried over from the record 1979 yields.

''This leaves the supply of feed grains very tight, a prospect that could lead
to even lower levels of meat production in the second and third quarters of this
year than we were expecting,'' said Terry Barr, a department economist.

Stocks of soybeans, another major element in livestock feeding, were estimated
at 42.2 million metric tons, down 12 percent from last year.

But Mr. Barr said the department did not expect any major rise in soybean prices
because of the carry-in from last year's record crop and the prospects of large
soybean yields soon to be harvested in Brazil and Argentina.

Foreign demand for American feed grains was also continuing and the department
expected exports of these grains to exceed 74 million tons, another record.

Supplies of corn, the largest of the feed grain components, were slightly larger
than earlier estimates but reserve stocks expected to be on hand when the 1981
harvest begins next October were set at 14.4 million tons, the lowest since
1976.

The tightness of corn supplies and continued high export demand were expected to
hold corn prices above $3.25 a bushel, compared with last season's $2.52
average. The department expected wheat prices to range between $3.95 and $4.15,
higher than last year's $3.78-a-bushel average.

Unusually low subsurface moisture levels in the Corn Belt states this month were
causing concern among that region's farmers, whose corn and soybean crops were
badly damaged by drought last summer.

Trade deals needed for agriculture's benefit

BYLINE: Aaron Krause, Norwalk Reflector, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 608 words


March 23--WASHINGTON -- People who care about agriculture need to be "engaged on
trade," a national agriculture advocate told members of a farming group this
months.

Rosemarie Watkins, director of the international policy team for the American
Farm Bureau Federation, said exports account for between 1/3 and 1/4 of U.S.
agriculture receipts.

"It's critical to the future," she added

While agriculture is the only U.S. industry that enjoys a trade surplus,
problems loom ahead, Watkins told Ohio county farm bureau presidents --
including Huron County Farm Bureau President John Brooks.

U.S. trading to Columbia, for example, is declining very rapidly, Watkins said.
A group of South American countries have made a deal with Columbia.

"Their grain is replacing our grain," Watkins said. "In short, their grain is
cheaper," with no tariffs.

Also, Peru is displacing the United States as a wine exporter to Korea, she
said.

"Other countries are moving into markets that are traditionally ours," Watkins
said.

Congress needs to pass three outstanding free trade agreements, according to the
American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF). The organization estimates that the
combined agreements represent almost $2.5 billion in additional exports, but
that is only if they are implemented.

The U.S.-Columbia agreement represents U.S. agricultural export gains of more
than $815 million per year at full implementation.

Currently, Colombian products enter the U.S. dutyfree through the Andean Trade
Preference Act, which Congress has passed and extended numerous times. U.S.
farmers, meanwhile, continue to face tariff barriers that average 25 percent
when exporting products into the Colombian market.

Passage of the Columbia agreement will eliminate the tariffs placed on U.S.
products, according to the AFBF.

The U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement could mean increased U.S. agricultural
exports to Panama of more than $195 million per year by full implementation.

"Most Panamanian agricultural imports to the United States enter with zero
tariffs under U.S. preference programs," the AFBF fact sheet reads. "The
agreement will level the playing field by providing U.S. products exported to
Panama with the same duty-free access already enjoyed by Panamanian products
imported by the United States."

The Korea Free Trade Agreement is one of the largest trade agreements for the
United States, according to the AFBF. An economic analysis by the Farm Bureau
estimates that, once fully implemented, U.S. agriculture could exceed $1.9
billion per year in additional agricultural exports.

In response to a question, Watkins said based on an economic analysis, these
agreements represent fair trade.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of Ohio's two senators, also addressed the group.
Someone asked him why trade with China is "so out of balance."

"We've had presidents of both parties that have sold us out," the Democratic
senator said. "We are finally starting to enforce some of the trade laws."

Turning to matters at home, one county farm bureau representative told Brown
there has been talk about changing the crop insurance payment due date from
November to August.

"A lot of farmers don't have money in August," the representative said.

Brown said he's not aware of the talk about changing the date.

"It's very helpful to know that," he said.

Tulsa Convenience Store Owner Sentenced for Stealing Nearly $300,000 From
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

LENGTH: 268 words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Office for the United States Attorneys,Northern District of Oklahoma has issued
the following news release:




 TULSA, Okla.- Milton Islam, 47, of Broken Arrow, and owner of Apache Food Mart
in Tulsa, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing $282,912 from the
United States Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP), formerly known as Food Stamps, announced United States Attorney
Danny C. Williams Sr. for the Northern District of Oklahoma. In addition to the
prison sentence, United States District Court Chief Judge Gregory K. Frizzell
ordered Islam to pay $282,912 in restitution to the United States Department of
Agriculture. Islam was indicted by a grand jury in March 2015 and pleaded guilty
on May 12, 2015.


 At the change of plea hearing, Islam admitted that from May 26, 2011 to July
31, 2014, he stole from SNAP using a scheme in which customers used their SNAP
benefits to receive cash, rather than nutritional assistance. The cash customers
received was only half the amount that Islam received from SNAP.
 The case was investigated by the United States Department of Agriculture-Office
of the Inspector General. Assistant United States Attorneys Clinton J. Johnson,
Shannon Cozzoni, and Catherine Depew prosecuted the case.
 SNAP offers nutrition assistance to eligible, low-income individuals and
families. To report suspicious Nutrition Assistance fraud, call the Oklahoma
Fraud Hotline at (405) 521-3444 or email OIGFraud2@okdhs.org

Washington: UPDATED: Statement from Agriculture Secretary Vilsack on Child
Nutrition

LENGTH: 548  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: United States Department of Agriculture has issued the following
news release:



 April 8, 2016 - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today released the following
statement in response to a new report done jointly by the Food Research & Action
Center (FRAC) and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP)This is an
external link or third-party site outside of the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) website. regarding positive outcomes of the Community
Eligibility Provision (CEP), part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act,
which allows eligible high-poverty schools to offer school meals to all students
at no charge, so they can focus on serving children the nutritious meals they
need to learn, instead of doing paperwork.





 "This report is further evidence that schools participating in CEP are making
great strides ensuring that all children are well nourished and prepared to
learn, especially since many of these students rely on school meals as their
best source of nutritious food. CEP is a win for schools, parents and students,
and the results we've seen in the first 2 years of nationwide implementation are
inspiring. The report also underscores how the 2010 bipartisan child nutrition
law has achieved significant positive results for child nutrition and health. It
is because of these undeniable results that I urge Congress to stay the course
in child nutrition. It would be unwise to roll back standards, saddle parents
and school administrators with more paperwork or weaken assistance for our most
vulnerable children. USDA stands ready to work with Congress to support the
reauthorization of child nutrition programs that continue to improve the health
and wellbeing of the next generation."



 The CEP report shows:



     In the 2014-2015 school year, 4,000 new schools took advantage of the
ability to streamline school meal administration through CEP;

     In total, 3,000 school districts and 18,000 schools-more than half of all
eligible schools-are participating, benefitting more than 8.5 million students
without stigma;

     Due in part to CEP, more than 90,000 schools and child care sites now
participate in the School Breakfast Program; participation among children has
increased 27 percent since 2009; and

     Schools participating in CEP are benefiting from improved program
integrity, fewer hours spent on administrative work, and increased student
participation in meal programs;



 Since passage of the bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010,
America's children have benefitted in the following ways:



     Data show that obesity rates are falling among young kids;

     97 percent of schools have embraced updated, healthier meal standards;

     Kids are now eating at least 13 percent more of their entrees, at least 16
percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit at lunch;

     More low-income children are benefiting from breakfast and lunch programs;

     Nearly 4 million children have access to healthy food in the summer when
school is out and meals are scarce; and

     8 million low-income women, infants and young children now receive an
improved variety of healthy food through WIC.

USDA initiative targets farm energy efficiency

BYLINE: The Aberdeen Times staff

LENGTH: 625  words


An initiative designed to help agricultural producers transition to more energy
efficient operations has begun through the United States Department of
Agriculture.

The initiative will make funding available for individual on-farm energy audits
designed to save both money and energy when fully implemented, according to
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

Reducing energy use on America's farms and ranches will not only help our
agricultural producers become more profitable, but also help the United States
become more energy independent," said Vilsack. "Through this initiative,
producers will be able to receive individual on-farm energy audit evaluations
and assistance with implementation of energy conservation and efficiency
measures."

Approximately 1,000 on-farm energy audit evaluations in 29 states will be funded
by $2 million through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) in
fiscal year 2010. The energy audits will be individually tailored to ensure
coverage of each farm's primary energy uses such as milk cooling, irrigation
pumping, heating and cooling of livestock production facilities, manure
collection and transfer, grain drying, and similar common on-farm activities.

Participating states include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

Implementation will occur in stages beginning with the short-term immediate goal
of providing the on-farm energy audits to help identify how the operations can
become more energy efficient. Longer term goals will involve development of
agricultural energy management plans for cost effective implementation of the
recommendations provided in their on-farm energy audits. More information about
agricultural energy management plans is available at:
www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/eqip/cap.html.

The 2008 Farm Bill provides authority to use EQIP financial assistance funds for
payment of practices and conservation activities involving the development of an
Agricultural Energy Management Plan (AgEMP) appropriate for the eligible land of
a program participant. The Farm Bill statute allows EQIP payments for up to 75
percent of the estimated incurred cost of practice implementation for the
development of an AgEMP meeting agency standards and requirements.

Eligible producers in the above listed states may apply for the AgEMP through
application at their local NRCS office. EQIP payments are made directly to
program participants for development of an AgEMP by a certified Technical
Service Provider Capitol in 1971, I was serving

Information about how to apply for an AgEMP is available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/eqip/EQIP_signup/2009_sign-up/index.html. Click on

Dairy, beef, poultry, swine, and other agricultural operations are included in
this energy efficiency initiative. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation
Service, in partnership with USDA Rural Development, will implement the
agricultural energy conservation and efficiency initiative.

For information about other NRCS conservation programs, online visit:
www.nrcs.usda. gov, or visit the nearest USDA Service Center. This year
represents the 75th year of NRCS "helping people help the land." Since its
inception the NRCS conservation delivery system has advanced a unique
partnership with state and local governments and private landowners delivering
conservation based on specific, local conservation needs, while accommodating
state and national interests.

U.S. sees breakthrough in farm-subsidy conflict: WTO talks in Zurich: Canada
onside with proposal, Trade Minister says

BYLINE: Peter Morton, Washington Bureau Chief, Financial Post

SECTION: FINANCIAL POST; Pg. FP6

LENGTH: 464  words


The United States and the European Union continued yesterday to push their joint
proposal to phase out farm subsidies in the stalled round of global trade talks,
despite opposition from developing countries and Japan.

Rob Portman, the U.S. trade negotiator, insisted yesterday in Zurich there is a
chance there could be a breakthrough in the Doha Round of World Trade
Organization talks planned for Hong Kong in December.

"For the first time, I see real movement toward having a successful meeting in
Hong Kong," he said, referring to a ministerial meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in December at which vital decisions have to be made.

The United States and the European Union have proposed phasing out as much as
90% of import tariffs on foreign agricultural products imposed by the richest
countries in one stage, eventually bringing the import duties to zero.

The move, outlined this weekend in preliminary talks, was welcomed by Jim
Peterson, the Canadian Trade Minister.

"One of our key priorities has been to achieve substantial reductions in
trade-distorting domestic support, particularly by the highest spenders, the
European Commission and the United States," he said.

"The negotiations had been stalled, and Canada appreciates the fact that the
United States has now taken steps to move the negotiations forward."

Yet other countries, including Brazil and Japan, said the United States and EU
did not go far enough.

Celso Amorim, Brazil's Foreign Minister, said developing countries in the G20
group he chairs believed the U.S. plan was "insufficient because it does not
lead to real cuts in U.S. budgetary expenditures on subsidies."

Kamal Nath, India's Trade Minister, also said poorer countries were less than
happy with the proposals.

"I would welcome this step [the U.S. plan], but what we need is a leap that
removes the great structural imbalances in agriculture," he said.

Mineichi Iwanaga, Japan's Agriculture Minister, also said the United States was
not going nearly far enough.

"The reductions which are being asked of Japan and Europe are out of balance
with the reductions that the U.S. is ready to make," he said.

The powerful farm union in the United States, called COPA, also said it was
unhappy with the proposals from the EU and United States.

But Mr. Portman said now is the time for countries to make concessions if they
want to see any hope of the round, launched in Doha three years ago, succeeding.

"We really don't have time to play games," he said. "We need to make real
progress. If others don't come along, then the Doha Round is in danger."

The 148 countries in the WTO are trying to kick-start the talks in a bid to wrap
them up in five days of meetings starting on Dec. 13 in Hong Kong. The round was
originally scheduled to end on Jan. 1 this year.

Some Say U.S. Lags in Blocking Foot-and-Mouth Disease at the Border

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25


With foot-and-mouth disease spreading into a fourth European country last week,
there is growing concern that the United States has not done enough to block the
disease at the border and that should it invade here, America would be hard
pressed to stamp it out.

If the worst should happen, independent experts and officials say, a failure to
exclude the disease or to stop any invasion quickly could devastate American
food production and international agricultural trade.

In the last two years, the Department of Agriculture has reported 18 emergency
outbreaks of foreign plant and animal diseases in the United States, a startling
increase from the previous average of one or two a year.

Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said the government was seeking to balance
its support for the forces of globalization and the need to protect its $50
billion meat industry. "You've got to be able to protect your infrastructure,
your farms and ranches, without being seen as creating trade barriers," Ms.
Veneman said in an interview last week. "Clearly with this strain of virulent
foot-and-mouth disease we're completely justified in the measures we've taken."

Last week, as Ireland followed Britain, France and the Netherlands in confirming
the blight's spread, American officials voiced confidence in a series of
measures aimed at keeping it overseas. The Agriculture Department has set up an
emergency hot line to give advice on foot-and-mouth disease, halted the
importation of meat and meat products from the European Union and placed ports
of entry on heightened alert.

The department has also added inspectors at airports and border posts and
deployed teams of beagles to sniff out hidden meats being brought in by
travelers. And, Ms. Veneman said, she has sent 40 scientists to assist in the
Europeans' containment efforts and provide her office with daily updates.

Still, some agriculture experts and livestock industry representatives say those
steps are not enough. They express fears that the Agriculture Department has
nothing close to the resources it needs to protect America's 170 million cattle,
sheep and pigs. The experience of northern Europe, which despite its expensive
and sophisticated surveillance and tracking systems has failed to contain the
disease, has worried many who had once felt safe.

"Quite frankly the department needs much more resources at all borders, and the
White House needs to think about this as a threat to our national economic
security," said Dan Glickman, the secretary of agriculture under President Bill
Clinton.

Even ranchers and farmers who are generally supportive of the Department of
Agriculture's efforts warn that American ports and borders are too porous. "The
U.S.D.A. is doing a commendable job with its resources, but no, it's not what
ought to be done," said Beth Lautner, vice president for science and technology
at the National Pork Producers Council. "We have a good safety net around our
country, but what's very disconcerting is that the U.K. has a good one, too, and
is overwhelmed by the disease."

Britain, which produces vaccines for other nations fighting foot-and-mouth
disease, had not had an outbreak since 1967. It has ordered the slaughter of
more than 400,000 cows, sheep and pigs, and has still not been able to contain
the virus. Last week British government experts predicted that the crisis would
continue to grow for months.

Other critics assert that the entire American strategy is too passive, because
the war is lost if the disease ever reaches American herds. As in Britain, a
severe outbreak here would probably require the government to kill vast numbers
of livestock and to quarantine farms, driving up food prices, disrupting
transportation and upsetting consumers.

"This policy of wait and see is clearly insufficient," said Senator Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. Mr. Daschle has called for a full
moratorium on the importation of all livestock and meat products from all
countries.

To Ms. Veneman, that would be the first shot in a disastrous trade war that
could ultimately hurt all kinds of American food and farm exports, valued at $59
billion a year, including $4.5 billion a year of meat. "With 96 percent of the
world population living outside the U.S., we have to have those markets abroad,"
she said. "As the economy becomes more global, so too does the food system."

The livestock industry would be at immediate risk. The foot-and-mouth virus
afflicts cloven-hoofed animals and generally reduces their ability to gain
weight and produce milk. It is not harmful to people, even if they eat diseased
meat. It is spread by direct or indirect contact with infected animals. The
disease is endemic in every continent, except North America, Australia and
Antarctica.

In theory the threat posed by the European outbreak is no greater than threats
from infected animals in parts of Argentina, say, or the Korean peninsula. But
the high volume of tourism and trade between the United States and European
countries makes that outbreak more serious here.

In addition, the rise of immigration to the United States from regions where
foot-and-mouth is entrenched, especially South America and Asia, has increased
the risk of its introduction here, as travelers return with food or other traces
from diseased animals.

The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, warned in 1997
that these pressures were forcing inspectors to take shortcuts that "raise
questions about the efficiency and the overall effectiveness of these
inspections."

Rather than earmark more money for agricultural protection, President Bush cut
next year's budget for the Agriculture Department by 7 percent, to $17.9
billion. Ms. Veneman said that she would maintain the same spending level for
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, her agency's main protection
office, but that there were no plans for a substantial increase in its budget.

The United States brings considerable experience to fighting the disease. After
six outbreaks in the last century, it set about eradicating the blight from
North America. In 1947, Washington led a quasi-military campaign in Mexico and
pushed the disease south of Panama. In 1954, the federal government established
a secure research facility at Plum Island, off Long Island, to develop vaccines.
The last outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United States was in 1929.

In recent years, the government also established the National Animal Health
Emergency Management System, a network of industry, state and federal veterinary
groups and the Department of Agriculture. Last year, the network held a
military-style exercise based on the scenario of an outbreak in Texas that
simulated the task of identifying, isolating and killing infected animals, then
burning or burying their carcasses.

"We had to have pre-emptive slaughters, a scorched-earth policy taking out herds
in front of the disease," said Ms. Lautner of the pork council, who took part in
the exercise.

But the United States Animal Health Association, an independent group led by
state veterinarians, predicts trouble if there is an outbreak. In a 1998 report,
the group warned that the first cases could be misdiagnosed because producers
are unfamiliar with the disease; that producers and politicians might resist the
slaughter of apparently healthy exposed herds; and that the high density of
animals in huge dairies and feedlots might exacerbate the disease's spread.

Joe Annelli, head of emergency services for the animal and plant inspection
service, counters that his agency is ready. He has stationed 450 foreign animal
disease specialists around the country, who can reach any farm in the
continental United States by car in four hours or less.

Mass vaccination is viewed by scientists and livestock producers as a last
resort, because the vaccines are not foolproof.

Testing for the disease is limited to the remote Plum Island laboratory, the
only site in the United States where live virus can be used. All suspected
tissue has to be examined on Plum Island, a procedure that critics say costs
precious time.

Because of limits on the use of live virus, there is a ban on the production of
the vaccine in the United States, which puts the country at the mercy of foreign
producers. Dennis Steadman, head of North American operations for Merial Ltd.,
which agriculture officials say has the contract to produce vaccine in case of a
United States emergency, said he was skeptical that his company could ramp up
production in time.

"I'd be surprised," Mr. Steadman said. "Just the sheer size of the livestock
population in the U.S. would be a tremendous leap in volume."

EEC seeking   farm dialogue

BYLINE: REUT

LENGTH: 281 words

DATELINE: Brussels BELGIUM


BRUSSELS  (Reuter) - The European Economic Community's Farm Council
 president, Niels Anker Kofoed, has accused the United States of unfair
 criticism of its policies and urged more co-operation to head off an
 agricultural trade war.

Mr. Kofoed said agriculture had become the crucial issue dividing the
 community and the United States following the resolution of disputes over
 steel and the Siberian gas pipeline.

The United States has repeatedly criticized the community's large farm
 subsidies used to raise exports. It says U.S. farmers are being squeezed
 out of their traditional world markets by unfair European competition.

Mr. Kofoed told a news conference after a two-day farm ministers'
 meeting: 'The U.S. view of our agricultural policy is superficial. They
 lack knowledge as to how the community functions.'
    Mr Kofoed, who met senior U.S. agricultural officials in Washington
 last week, said his intention was to encourage a dialogue with Washington.
    'It is no good being on a head-on collision course and starting a
 trade war. This is in nobody's interest and would be of enormous detriment
 to both sides.'
    The Reagan Administration is expected to deliver a sharp attack on the
 community's multi-billion-dollar Common Agricultural Policy at ministerial
 trade talks in Geneva next week, diplomats said.

But the community is refusing to budge from its arguments that the
 subsidies are permissible under the rules of the General Agreement on
 Tariffs and Trade, they added.

It argues that steep rises in the community's exports of goods like
 wheat, sugar and dairy products reflect a larger world market and do not
 mean rival producers are being elbowed out of traditional markets.
