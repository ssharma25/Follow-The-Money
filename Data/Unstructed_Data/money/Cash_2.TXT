Johnny Cash defiant to the very end

BYLINE: Craig S. Semon

`American VI: Ain't No Grave'

Johnny Cash (American Recordings/Lost Highway)

* * *-1/2

On the verge of the greatest journey of his life, Johnny Cash was working on
songs for his fans to treasure long after his death.

Cash, who died Sept. 12, 2003, began working on his last two "American"
collections after finishing 2002's "American IV: The Man Comes Around." Doing
what he does best, Cash recorded songs even after his wife, June Carter Cash,
died in May 2003, and he continued right up to his own death. The posthumous
"American V: A Hundred Highways" (released in 2006) and "American VI: Ain't No
Grave" (released last month on the day that would have been Cash's 78th
birthday) concludes the soul searching from one of America's great musical
spirits. And from the sound of it, Cash and the Grim Reaper duked it out to the
bitter end. While Death might have taken the singer's life, he didn't take
Cash's soul. In fact, Cash reigned triumphant as the ultimate Man in Black, and
his latest is testament to that.

Even with his best singing days far behind him, Cash's world-weary,
weather-beaten voice still had plenty of gusto and heart. And even without
knowing his rich story, one can easily get the sense that Cash is a man who
loved greatly, suffered great losses, and lied and cheated a great deal. You are
convinced that the Man in Black is drawing from the personal hells he has
endured in his rich but less than virtuous life. With a sinner-saint authority
that conveyed both honesty and strength, Cash always walked the line between
damnation and redemption in his music.

"American VI: Ain't No Grave" is Cash's sixth and final collaboration with rock
producer Rick Rubin, who helped re-establish the legendary artist as a vital
force and go through a creative rebirth of epic proportions, starting the
comeback with 1994's stark, bare-bones solo triumph, "American Recordings." Cash
chastises Gabriel the Archangel not to blow his trumpet until he hears from him
first on the title track, "Ain't No Grave." Despite his ailing health, Cash is
not going to slip off this mortal coil until he's good and ready. Shrouded in a
dark and ominous mix of rattling chains, creaky guitars, plucking banjo and a
tolling bell, Cash urgently croons, "Well there ain't no grave/Gonna hold my
body down."

A grief-stricken Cash weeps for those who are suffering and those who are dead
and gone on Sheryl Crow's peacenik protest song, "Redemption Day." With a
well-earned, elder-statesman authority, Cash advises world leaders that social
injustice must end. With Cash's bare-bones reading and stripped-down
accompaniment of sparse guitar, pump organ and piano, the song becomes an
intimate and inspirational cry for freedom.

While Kris Kristofferson's "For the Good Times" is about the end of a romance,
Cash, in the fragile, final stage of his life, transforms the meaning of the
song to be about the end of one's existence. Counting his blessings rather than
cursing his ailing condition, Cash passionately belts (that is, as much as his
frail pipes could belt in his final days) the beautiful, bittersweet chorus and
concludes there will be time enough for sadness when you leave.

The album's sole Cash original, "I Corinthians 15:15," is a keeper. Finding
solace in Scripture and the sound of a strumming guitar, Cash prays to the
Almighty up above for his ship to sail friendly seas, until he is ready to dock
in God's "harbor of light" and become one of heaven's shiny stars. Cash delivers
the inspirational sermon, "Oh death, where is thy sting?/Oh grave, where is thy
victory?" His voice is shot to hell, but his faith is unwavering and resonates
with urgency. Here, Cash is a man who lived a full life, a failed life, but is
thankful for all of it.

Cash turns Tom Paxton's sturdy trucker song "Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm
Bound" into a poetic evaluation of a man's worth. With nothing to show for his
vagabond existence, Cash gives this solid advice to anyone who romanticizes the
life of a rambler.

On paper, Ed McCurdy's "Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream" sounds hokey,
naive and outdated. In Cash's hands, it sounds like another triumph.

After all this talk of redemption, regrets and reapers, a mischievous Cash
emerges on Queen Lili'uokalani's "Aloha Oe," which closes out the album, as well
as the "American Recording" series. With the tropical paradise melody of breezy
guitars, Cash doesn't slip off this mortal coil. He does the hula. Cash doesn't
ham it up like the King in 1961's "Blue Hawaii," but he does treat his final
luau as a celebration, as he should, and he certainly comes off as the big
kahuna. Cash embraces the Hawaiian Islands' well-wishes, "One fond embrace/a hoi
ae au/Until we meet again," as if it's as important as anything he has ever
read, sang or recited in his life. And, in many ways, he's right.

HUGE SALUTE TO CASH;
 JOHNNY'S ACOUSTIC GUITAR TO BE THE STAR

BYLINE: ROGER RYAN

SECTION: Eire Edition; FEATURES; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 733 words

HIGHLIGHT: HERO: Johnny cash


WHEN Johnny Cash died, he was incredibly busy working on "new" music, music he
had never ventured to experiment with before - acoustic music.

He disposed of his thunka-thunk thunka-thunk sound, and entered into a musical
genre, very close to, and relative to, classic and golden country music. One of
his greatest recent works, Hurt is so powerful, so potent, that anyone who
listens to it, does so with tears in their eyes.

When Bob Everhart, the president of the National Traditional Country Music
Association, was talking with Dennis Devine, the number one fan and personal
friend of Johnny Cash, about where Johnny Cash was with his music when he died,
Dennis immediately started the fire burning to do a tribute to Cash, but do it
in such a way that the legacy of his music, might live on.The tribute show is
planned for Iowa from Aug 29 to Sept 4.

The first person Devine contacted was Sharon Graves in Grand Island, Nebraska.
Sharon is the person who purchased the Johnny Cash acoustic guitar at auction
from Sothebys Auction House for $ 131,000. Her first reaction was, "yes, let's
pursue this adventure." She has promised to bring this very famous and expensive
guitar to the festival that Everhart is celebrating, now in its 30th year. From
August 29 to September 4 thousands of people will enjoy ten sound stages and 600
performers, and on Thursday, September 1, a very special Tribute to Johnny Cash
will be staged... an all acoustic music happening, never before contemplated, or
presented.

Once the guitar of Johnny Cash was established as the headliner, Everhart and
Devine set about filling the programme with performers that might be interested
in playing on this expensive acoustic guitar and this wonderful tribute show.
The fulfillment of the legacy left by Cash was well under way.

The programme, as put together by Everhart and Devine, is a monument to Cash.
Dennis Devine, will serve as host and emcee. The line-up looks something like
this: Bill Dewey, a native Iowan, will begin the program playing his favourite
Cash songs, on an acoustic guitar; Kent Thompson a popular disc jockey on KOIL
Radio in Omaha, will not only sing some of his favorite Johnny Cash songs, he
will be inducted into America's Old Time Country Music Hall of Fame, for his
involvement in playing Cash music on his radio station, as well as his
performance of those songs, again....acoustically; Peggy Knight served as the
housekeeper for Johnny Cash for 33 years. She too, will be inducted into the
Hall of Fame, and will have an opportunity to talk about her days in that very
private world of the Cash's personal life; Sharon Graves, the inspiration for
the acoustic idea, will have the Cash guitar on hand for anyone to use on the
show, and she will also be awarded the Rising Legend award from the National
Traditional Country Music Assn.; Terry Smith is the songwriter of Far Side Banks
of Jordan which Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash recorded for the very
successful movie The Apostle, which Robert Duvall produced and directed; Marvin
Rainwater, a successful recording artist in his own right (Gonna Find Me A
Bluebird), was a close personal friend of the Cash's, and will also be
performing his favourite Cash songs acoustically; Sherwin Linton from
Minneapolis, Minnesota, is perhaps the best Johnny Cash impersonator alive
today. His renditions of the great Cash songs acoustically, should bring magic
to the air, and with him, 12-year-old Taylor Marshall, another Johnny Cash
songster; Don Acuff (a cousin to Roy Acuff) was Johnny Cash's personal antique
dealer. He will be doing songs by his cousin as well as Cash; Robert Simek is
flying all the way from Slovakia to be on this show, and promote his newest CD
which has been released in Europe, entitled Hello I'm Not Johnny Cash; Skip
Segatto, an Omaha musician and performer has the largest Johnny Cash repertoire
in the midwest, and will close the show. The show stopper however, will be Tommy
Cash, Johnny Cash's brother. Tommy has been extremely successful with his own
career, recording such hits as Six White Horses, and The Gypsy Woman, and he
joins this incredible tribute show to launch his own Tribute to Johnny Cash. He
will also be inducted into America's Old Time Country Music Hall of Fame.

Institutions better to invest cash directly;
CASH MANAGEMENT TRUSTS

BYLINE: Ben Wilmot

SECTION: SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 905 words


Recent analysis suggests institutional investors are paying cash management fees
for nothing, finds Ben Wilmot.

Institutional investors are being misguided in their strategy of outsourcing
cash management to specialist fund managers.

An analysis of fund performance by Dr Jenny Diggle of RMIT Business school,
which compared investments made with a fund manager with direct investment in a
cash market, finds that institutional investors are paying fees to their cash
management funds

for nothing.

Diggle's study notes that a direct investment in the 11am cash market would have
outperformed both the top-five cash funds and an actively traded portfolio of
short-term interest rate securities in Australia between 1993 and 2000.

Her research estimated that the cost to financial managers of not actively
seeking a return for their cash funds, by investing across the short-term yield
curve, was up to 1.1 per cent.

Australia's cash management industry has rapidly grown funds under management
over the past decade to about the $30 billion mark.

In 1983 there were 11 cash management funds operating in Australia and by the
end of 2000 there were 34, says Diggle.

These managers say that their active management style can boost portfolio
returns above those returns available from directly investing in cash.

Diggle says that securities used by cash managers could outperform a direct
investment in cash, if the returns from the various securities were more
diversified.

However, because there was little variation in monthly returns on short-term
interest rate securities, Diggle says that there is little benefit from holding
any combination of these securities to reduce risk.

Instead, a fund would be better off holding a single security, especially if it
considers transaction costs and capital gains taxes, she says.

Diggle also undertook a more sophisticated analysis using a benchmark portfolio
to compare fund managers to the performance of the overall market.

She says that comparing cash fund managers against a cash index, made up of low
credit risk/high quality credit ranked securities such as government Treasury
Notes or AAA Bank bills, would only demonstrate by how much these fund managers
have underperformed or overperformed the market.

"It would not show if they had timing skills or were lucky; it would not show if
the size of the funds under management affect the returns achievable by the fund
manager; it would not show the investor the nature of the risks the fund manager
took in order to achieve their returns," she says.

So her research instead tested whether there was any real benefit in moving to a
cash specialist by building a portfolio that replicated those actually held by
fund managers.

But even changing the performance benchmark to reflect a more actively traded
normal portfolio, found that a direct investment in cash outperformed the
benchmark.

The standard deviation, a measure of volatility, for the normal portfolio was
slightly higher than the cash portfolio, but the return from a direct investment
in cash (7.60 per cent) was considerably higher than the normal portfolio (6.13
per cent) between January 1993 and December 2000.

"This analysis indicates that the direct investment in a single security 11am
cash is the preferred option for investment of an asset allocation to cash as it
generates a higher return and a lower standard deviation," says Diggle.

Her research also compares the returns from specialist cash managers with the
returns from a normal portfolio and an 11am portfolio.

The annualised holding period return on the cash alternative was 7.32 per cent
between January 1993 to July 1999, while the top fund manager DFM Investment
returned 6.43 per cent.

"None of the 17 managed funds analysed outperformed a direct investment in cash
in terms of returns, but as expected, all the managed funds achieved a
considerably lower standard deviation," says Diggle.

Further analysis of the returns from direct investment in cash and the top
quartile of managed funds show they are also closely correlated.

This means that there was no additional diversification benefit from choosing
one fund over another while a direct investment in 11am cash would provide
higher returns, says Diggle.

She says that the idea of outsourcing to a cash manager for the management of
the asset allocation to cash is even less beneficial when taxes and management
fees are included.

"This analysis provides strong evidence against the use of specialist fund
managers and would advocate the use of in-house staff to manage the cash
allocation," she says.

Diggle believes that the shift to outsourcing in Australia has been driven by
the complexities of the legislative changes, and the costs of administering the
funds in-house, rather than accessing superior returns.

Instead, she recommends that funds should invest across the short-term yield
curve. She says, because of their higher returns, bank bills cost the least to
keep in a fund over the long term, albeit by less than 0.01 per cent.

Diggle urges the responsible entities of managed investment schemes and
directors of funds to re-evaluate outsourcing as they consider the cost of not
having every investment dollar returning to its maximum potential.

Self manage

Direct investment in the cash market outperformed top five cash funds.

Investment in 11am cash provides higher returns.

Outsourcing to a cash manager is less beneficial when including taxes and fees.

REPORT ON MUTUAL FUNDS The cash cushion Funds that keep extra money on hand can
provide insulation from market chaos.

BYLINE: BY ANDREW ALLENTUCK ; SPCL

SECTION: REPORT ON BUSINESS SPECIAL REPORT; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 1533 words


Special to The Globe and Mail
   FOR some mutual funds, cash truly was a cushion during last month's dramatic
market fall. Mutual funds with high cash levels shielded their unitholders from
much of the meltdown that occurred on Grey Monday.

Investors might not normally consider the cash component an important criterion
for choosing among equity funds. After all, they buy stock funds expecting their
managers to be in stocks.

But for investors who want to have some insulation from market chaos, high cash
-holding funds may be worth a look. More importantly, cash levels say much about
a fund's investment philosophy and can be an important indicator of both returns
and volatility, says Winnipeg financial adviser David Christianson.

"Cash does not fluctuate in value. It's a cushion when the market is falling,
but an anchor when it is rising," he says. "The investor should know if his fund
holds substantial cash as an investment philosophy."

The average Canadian equity fund held 9.9 per cent cash at the end of October,
according to Portfolio Analytics Ltd. Cash levels varied from a high of 35 per
cent to a low of zero.

When Grey Monday struck, the $143.9-million Talvest New Economy Fund was right
at the high end. And when the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell
6.2 per cent on Oct. 27, the fund suffered a loss of just 0.26 per cent.

That high cash level was fortuitous, for the fund usually holds just 10 per cent
cash, says Gisele Wilson, chief investment officer of TAL Investment Counsel
Ltd. in Montreal. But Talvest, she says, had essentially paused for a rest.

"We had the cash because many of our stocks had reached their target prices and
we had sold to restructure and diversify the fund."

The $253.6-million Templeton Canadian Stock Fund was another cash-heavy winner
in the meltdown. With nearly 27 per cent in cash, it fell just 0.3 per cent on
Oct. 27.

"Our usual cash level is more like 10 per cent," says manager Norm Boersma. "We
were [more than] 15 per cent above that, but we are comfortable with a cash
cushion."

For an equity fund to have such a high percentage of assets out of the market
might seem odd, Mr. Boersma acknowledges. But "if we have done our job right, we
can make it up by having bought stock cheaper," he says. "Greater growth is the
payoff of patience."

Many other managers don't believe in holding such uninvested cash balances --
even if the more fully invested funds bore the brunt of the Oct. 27 decline. The
$3.8-billion Investors Canadian Equity Fund, for instance, was 3 per cent in
cash on Oct. 27 -- and fell 5.8 per cent.

But manager Scott Penman disdains high cash levels as a defensive strategy.
"Within our portfolios at Investors Group, if we think that markets are
overextended or risky, then we can change the asset mix and add to their
defensive character," he says. "But cash is just another asset, just another
stock, as it were. To have 10 per cent or 20 per cent in one stock is a very big
risk."

That's also the view of Rick Howson, manager of the $21.3-million Saxon Stock
Fund, which had 1.5 per cent cash and dropped 5 per cent on the day.

Mr. Howson, however, has no regrets. "My advice is to go with the guy who stays
fully invested at all times," he says. "Nobody can successfully time the
market's peaks and valleys. After all, cash is an asset and an investor in a
high cash fund will be left behind if the market goes up."

Mr. Howson also contends that a fund holding high cash levels turns its
portfolio manager into what he calls a "triggerman."

That means the investor is shifting the job of timing as well as asset selection
to the manager -- and the investor should be sure that the manager's sense of
timing is in keeping with his or her own. "It does no good to pick a timer who
opposes your own view of the market," he says.

Market timing is also an issue that concerns Karl Schultz. Knowing when markets
will turn is a very tough call, says the managing director of TD Asset
Management Inc., whose two in-house-managed Canadian equity funds -- the
$831.1-million Green Line Canadian Equity Fund and the $501.4-million Green Line
Value Fund -- each held about 2 per cent on Oct. 27. The equity fund fell 5.3
per cent and the value fund was down 6.1 per cent on Grey Monday.

"We take the view that equity funds should be fully invested," Mr. Schultz says,
noting the low cash levels are a consistent practice. "We are paid to be equity
investors in these funds and that is the job we do.

"As well, we don't want investors to buy equity positions and then find out that
they really have bought money-market instruments."

Indeed, investors may question why they're paying fatter management fees for
funds that are supposed to be invested in equities when they are substantially
in cash, Mr. Christianson notes.

And they do pay. Management expense ratios for Canadian equity funds averaged
2.15 per cent in October versus just 0.99 per cent for money market funds,
according to Portfolio Analytics. Mr. Christianson notes that investors can hold
cash and receive interest in a variety of other vehicles, including treasury
bills and bank deposits, and avoid paying a manager for what they can do
themselves.

Some managers see the cash issue as part of the investment equation. "Our
guidelines allow the portfolio manager to hold a lot of cash. That is because we
seek a total return for investors, not just management of a pool of stocks,"
says Karen Bleasby, vice-president of investments at Spectrum United Mutual
Funds, whose $1.3-billion Spectrum United Canadian Equity Fund was 25 per cent
in cash and declined 1.34 per cent on Oct. 27.

"For us, the cash level of 25 per cent was tactical -- you could call it
opportunistic. A year ago, in a more normal market, we had less cash. Over the
long run, we should average 5 to 10 per cent."

Jonathan Wellum, manager of the $1.9-billion AIC Advantage Fund, takes the view
that his investors are buying expertise more than a pool of stocks. With a
10-per-cent cash position, AIC Advantage fell 5.1 per cent on Oct. 27. The newer
$2.9-billion AIC Advantage II Fund, with 25 per cent cash as a result of recent
inflows, declined only 0.41 per cent.

"Our attitude at AIC is that we have no compulsion to be aggressive buyers in
the current market," he says. "We value companies we own, but there is an issue
of what we are prepared to pay. In fact, in our U.S. funds, we are running as
high as 40 to 50 per cent cash. We just don't believe that our investors are
telling us to pay anything at all for stocks."

So how can investors know just how cash-heavy a fund is? They can read
prospectuses, quarterly and monthly reports and other marketing literature or
call fund management companies' client service lines and ask.

Bill Proctor, whose $1.1-billion Industrial Horizon Fund held 17 per cent cash
and fell just 0.41 per cent on Oct. 27, says that while cash levels may
sometimes fluctuate, most of the time "most managers don't swing cash much from
month to month." If funds are cash-heavy, it's worth asking why, Mr. Howson
says. "If cash seems high, then ask the fund company if the cash is there as a
strategic reserve or temporarily as a result of in-flows of money, such as
during RRSP season," he advises.

While cash may seem like the right place to be during market downswings such as
last month, "long-term, holding cash is a loser's bet," Mr. Proctor says. "The
markets will outperform cash over the long term."

On the money

Funds with higher cash levels suffered less during the market meltdown.

Cash flow deserves more than a little respect; Roger Davis and Peter Holgate
find a neglected area in company financial reports

BYLINE: ROGER DAVIS and PETER HOLGATE

SECTION: ACCOUNTANCY AND MANAGEMENT PAGE; Page 28

LENGTH: 911 words


WE know from our personal lives that cash flow is important. It is all very well
to be asset-rich, but running out of cash in a country mansion has the same
effect on the stomach as running out of cash in a bedsit.

Likewise in business. We all know of promising businesses that have run out of
cash through overtrading or by being too reliant on short-term funding. We know
of companies that have run out of cash simply by incurring big losses.

Fortunately, most businesses do not run out of cash. They survive - or thrive -
not by chance but by keeping a close eye on cash flow and by preparing cash-flow
forecasts and monitoring actual cash flows against that forecast.

That emphasis is not adequately carried forward into the outside world.
Typically, the form of external reporting of cash flows is markedly different
from what companies actually do. This disparity results in analysts and other
users of financial statements not understanding companies' cash flow properly.
Hence they tend to pay less attention to published information on cash flows
than is merited.

What can be done to remedy this? Financial Reporting Standard 1 (FRS 1)
introduced a requirement for companies to publish a cash-flow statement. FRS 1
was published in 1991 and has been in operation for about two years.

On 1 October 1991, the Independent welcomed the new cash-flow statements but
warned that they would not be perfect. Their imperfections have become evident.
An opportunity has now arisen, however, to address them. The Accounting
Standards Board is considering submissions on how FRS 1 has worked in practice
and how it might be improved.

In some respects, cash-flow statements under FRS 1 have been very useful and a
big improvement on the statements of source and application of funds that they
replaced - not least because they report the actual cash flows. They classify a
company's cash flow - operating, interest and dividends, tax, investing,
financing - in a way which is intuitively obvious. Thus a statement can show:

how much has been generated by operations;

how much of that is taken up by paying interest and dividends;

how much is taken up by tax payments;

the extent to which the operating cash flow - after interest, dividends and tax
- has funded capital expenditure;

the implications for financing - in other words, whether there has been a net
repayment of finance or whether extra funds have had to be raised through
borrowing or share issues

Yet despite this, leading analysts acknowledge there is still too much emphasis
on the profit and loss account, and that insufficient attention is being given
to cash- flow information. This is due to inertia: analysts and others have been
brought up on monitoring earnings and are reluctant to change. But it is also
because the published cash-flow statements are still not good enough to be
genuinely useful.

The main problem is that FRS 1's notion of ''cash and cash equivalents'' (CCE)
is defined in an arbitrary way (based around a cut-off of instruments with less
than three months to maturity when acquired).

The three-month cut-off does not reflect how companies manage cash, debt and
treasury operations. Financial management is more concerned with the liquidity
and marketability of instruments than with their original period to maturity.
The consequences of this are twofold.

First, the three-month criterion can cause treasurers to depart from what would
be rational economic behaviour in order to show a particular result in the cash
-flow statement. For example, assuming a December year-end, a treasurer might,
when investing spare funds in October, prefer a three-month investment to a
six-month investment, even though the funds are not needed until April. That an
accounting standard has this effect is bad news indeed.

Second, investments and deposits that are liquid and marketable, yet which fall
outside the narrowly defined CCE, are presented as investing cash flows, where
they are aggregated with entirely different cash flows, such as purchases of new
plant.

So the published cash-flow statement does not get the respect it deserves from
the company management.

The cash-flow statement should not be seen as some kind of byproduct of the
accounts. Rather its importance is equal to that of the profit and loss account.

The two are not mutually exclusive. The profit and loss account potentially
gives a truer measure of performance because it estimates the outcome of
transactions not yet concluded by a cash payment or receipt. But because it
contains subjective estimates, it is vulnerable to shaky assumptions about the
future. And in the wrong hands it can be subject to a favourable gloss. In
contrast, cash is cash. It is the ultimate test of the quality of profits.

The publicised cash-flow statement needs greater respect from companies and
analysts. For companies, it needs to reflect the way they manage their finances.
For analysts, it needs to answer clearly the question: are the profits in the
bank?

The ASB should take the opportunity to ensure that it meets those needs. For
that is at least as important as any of the other measures the ASB has in hand
to regulate company accounts - many of which would be less necessary if proper
emphasis was given to cash flow.

Roger Davis is Head of Audit and Peter Holgate is Accounting Technical Partner
at Coopers & Lybrand.

Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet Lead Field As Kings Of Cash

Tech companies -- at least of the few of the real biggies -- continue to be cash
-generating machines, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)
having the most cash and equivalents of all U.S. nonfinancial companies, says a
new report from Moody's Investor Service.

Moody's predicts that cash holdings for all U.S. nonfinancial companies will
reach $1.77 trillion by year-end, up 5% from last year, with the tech sector
remaining dominant.

The top five cash holders are all tech companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google
parent Alphabet, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL). Together, Moody's
projects, they will hold $587 billion, or 33% of the total nonfinancial
corporate cash balance by the end of 2016. Cash figures include cash, cash
equivalents and liquid marketable securities.

Apple's cash holdings are expected to exceed $250 billion by year-end, or 14% of
total nonfinancial corporate cash holdings.

Microsoft will have $115 billion, with Alphabet at $85 billion, Cisco at $67
billion and Oracle at $68 billion.

The technology sector's share of total cash will rise to 49% in 2016, up 4%.

Most Cash Held Overseas, To Avoid Tax Man

Most of the cash that companies have is generated and being held overseas.
Moody's estimates that the amount of overseas cash will reach about $1.3
trillion, or 74% of total cash, in 2016. That's up from an estimated $1.2
trillion, or 72% of total cash, a year earlier.

"Without tax reform that reduces the negative financial consequences of
repatriating money to the U.S., we expect offshore cash levels to continue
increasing," said Richard Lane, a Moody's senior vice president.

Overseas cash from the top five tech companies is projected to reach $505
billion, or 86% of their total cash.

Moody's said corporate cash holdings have more than doubled in the last 10
years, driven by rising cash levels at companies in the technology sector.
Technology corporates now hold almost half of all cash that is held by U.S.
nonfinancial companies.

EUROPE: Top 10 cash kings raise share of [#x20ac]870 bln

LENGTH: 536  words


Corporate cash piles rose by 6% to EUR 870 bln in the year ending December 2014
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Moody's Investors Service said in
a special report. Of this cash pile, EUR 211 bln (nearly a quarter) is
concentrated in the hands of the top 10 cash holders, which make up 1.48% of the
672 non-financial corporate groups that Moody's rates.


But cash holdings by Russia's Gazprom and Rosneft have diminished, pushing them
out of the top ten.
"Volkswagen, EDF, BP, Fiat and Poste Italiane are Europe's top-five cash kings,
each holding between EUR 23 and 26 bln. Energy, automotive, telecoms and
utilities continue to be the most cash-flush industries in Europe," observed
Jean-Michel Carayon, author of the report.
"Companies might consider gradually using part of their cash balances,
especially if the cost of carrying cash on their balance sheets is high. Capital
expenditure will remain the single largest use of corporate cash-flow," said
Carayon.
Moody's research shows that the cash pile is increasingly concentrated among the
top cash holders, despite an increase in the number of rated issuers in EMEA.
This is mainly because large investment-grade companies tend to hold more cash,
while newly-rated EMEA companies are mostly highly-indebted issuers, including
leverage buyouts (LBOs) which have little cash on their balance sheets.
The rating agency expects companies to continue to retain significant cash
balances, as the cost of alternate liquidity (such as committed facilities) is
likely to increase with Basel III. Moody's observed that companies are currently
less concerned about funding availability, as ample liquidity (following the
European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme) and stronger market
appetite, are prompting a shift in behaviour. Holding substantial cash balances
is becoming less critical to companies, while substantial liquidity is available
in the market.
"While we expect M&A activity in 2015 to remain sustained, companies are finding
it more attractive to finance their deals through debt rather than using their
cash, due to abundant liquidity and low interest rates," noted Carayon.
While cash levels have soared in the past six years, European companies are
likely to begin prioritising growth, including acquisition-led growth. Moody's
expects the European bond market to remain the main source of funding for large
companies, and increasingly so for medium-sized companies.
Moody's research shows that, on a country-by-country basis, Russian companies'
cash holdings diminished in 2014. The decrease was mainly the result of lower
new debt issuance and lower oil prices. Russia's OJSC Gazprom (Ba1 negative) and
OJSC Oil Company Rosneft's (Ba1 negative) cash piles have diminished, meaning
that they are no longer among the top ten cash holders. Italian companies have
increased their cash balances. In Germany, cash balances decreased year-on-year
in 2014, partly due to a reduction in the cash balances of large cash holders
BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen.

Moody's also expects that the total cash pile could stabilise or fall slightly
in the future, if companies feel less need to hold substantial cash and it is
not cost-efficient.

Cashless payments 'most popular'

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY

LENGTH: 644 words


Cashless payments have become more popular than transactions using coins and
notes for the first time, figures from the Payments Council show.

During 2014, 48% of payments made by consumers, businesses and financial
organisations were in cash, down from just over half (52%) in 2013.

The Payments Council said that this marked the first time that the number of
non-cash payments has overtaken those made with cash, reflecting the growth in
technology and the use of debit cards as a handy way to pay.

Despite the shift, cash remains king among consumers, who used it for 52% of all
their payments in 2014. But even among consumers, the Payments Council said that
the number of payments being made in cash is expected to fall below half in
2016.

The growth of online shopping and the emergence of new payment methods such as
mobile and contactless payments have challenged the dominance of cash in recent
years.

Around three-quarters of Britons now shop online, compared with just over half
in 2008, according to a recent report from the Office for National Statistics
(ONS).

Contactless card payments, where a payment can be made with a single swipe of
the card rather than having to enter a Pin number, are also becoming
increasingly widely accepted, in places including Aldi, Barnardo's, Boots,
Greggs, Ikea, JD Wetherspoon, London Tubes, M6 Toll and Marks and Spencer.

Currently, the limit for a single contactless transaction is £20 - but from
September 1 onwards a higher limit of £30 will be rolled out.

Meanwhile, mobile payment services such as Paym, which is overseen by the
Payments Council, and Pingit, which was launched by Barclays in 2012, continue
to grow in popularity.

The tipping point for non-cash payments overtaking cash in the UK has come
slightly earlier than the Payments Council had previously expected, as 2015 had
been pencilled in as the year when non-cash payments would edge ahead.

But its new figures show that, in fact, 2014 turned out to be the year when the
number of non-cash payments started to eclipse the number of transactions using
cash.

During 2014, 18.3 billion payments were made with cash, while 19.8 billion were
made using another method. In total, around £250 billion-worth of payments were
made using cash in the UK in 2014.

The Payments Council emphasised that this is not the beginning of the end for
cash, with many people still heavily reliant on the notes in their wallet.

Its forecast for 2015 is that there will still be 17.9 billion cash
transactions, while the number of non-cash transactions will grow to 20.4
billion.

Even in 2024, 12.7 billion payments are still expected to be made in cash,
alongside 28.8 billion non-cash payments.

Nearly 47 million people used a cash machine last year and nine in 10 (91%)
consumers withdraw money from an ATM at least once a month.

According to UK cash machine network Link, the number of cash machines across
the country increased to a total of 69,382 by the end of 2014.

Graham Mott, head of development at Link, said: "Cash machine numbers are now at
a record high and Link is committed to continuing to make sure everybody has
safe, reliable and easy access to their cash."

The Payments Council said that consumers accounted for 99% of the 18
billion-plus cash payments made in the UK last year. The majority of these
payments were made in the retail, travel and entertainment sectors, reflecting a
need for convenience as well as the continuing presence of businesses that
prefer to be paid in cash, the payments body said.

In 2014, 1.6 million consumers predominantly used cash, representing 3.1% of all
adults.

Of those who heavily rely on cash for their day-to-day life, nearly 40% are aged
65 and over, the Payments Council said.

Meanwhile, 2.3 million people rarely used cash, representing 4.4% of all adults.
More than half of those who rarely use cash are aged under 35 years old.

Traders are all cashed up but nowhere to grow;
Alternative Investments

BYLINE: Alexandra Cain

SECTION: SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 10

High interest rates and the desire for safety make cash more attractive, but
there are setbacks, writes Alexandra Cain.

Cash investments look increasingly attractive as interest rates rise, but
advisers say it would be a mistake to switch out of equities and into cash.

Instead, they suggest keeping a portion of an investment portfolio in cash to
take advantage of the average 8 per cent return a cash investment now delivers.

AMP financial planner Phil Pilgrim says if you are someone who needs growth for
your investments, cash is not the place to be because the value of money sitting
in a cash account diminishes, over time, due to inflation.

"Some people have a low risk tolerance and their portfolio is skewed to cash,"
Pilgrim says. "But over the long term this won't achieve the returns of someone
with a more aggressive risk profile."

Although younger people still accumulating assets have less of a need for a
sizeable cash investment, Pilgrim suggests people who are in retirement have two
years of income in cash, with the rest of the portfolio in growth investments -
what Pilgrim calls a "growth strategy with a twist".

This approach means investors can use their cash as income when markets are
trending down, rather than drawing income from, and reducing the value of, the
asset in their portfolio that in normal market conditions deliver growth but
because of market conditions are not doing so in the short term.

"This will allow retirees to see this period of market volatility through, until
the cash component of the portfolio can be topped up from the growth assets,"
Pilgrim says.

There is a multitude of different ways to invest in cash, through a range of
different institutions.

Credit unions, building societies and the big banks all offer cash products.

In terms of investment structures, it's possible to invest in cash through
on-call accounts, term deposits, online accounts and cash management trusts and
funds.

Tony Togher, head of short term investments at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, says the fund manager offers a broad number of cash-based products.
"The different options include variable term profiles, access and variable
liquidity time frames, including same day redemption capacity," he says.

Each cash investment will have a unique risk profile and return and it's worth
looking at these dimensions before deciding which cash product to invest in.

Probably the least risky cash investment is an on-call account. This allows
investors to get their money out when they want. Michael Cant, executive general
manager of retail products at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, says "we offer
an online version, NetBank Saver, which has a rate of 7 percent".

Term deposits, on the other hand, offer slightly higher rates, but investors
have to wait for a defined period, usually three, six or 12 months, to access
their money, or risk paying a penalty.

CBA is offering 8.1 per cent for its term deposits which, says Cant, "are very
popular at the moment because rates are so high".

"We are increasingly seeing clients invest in bank deposits, they like the
safety and security of a big bank; we've seen a real flight to security," Cant
says.

Cash management trusts are another popular way to invest in cash, with Macquarie
Bank's version one of the more popular CMTs among retail investors.

When it comes to investing in a CMT, Steve Ryan, head of products, research and
technical services at Westpac Financial Planning, says "you have to understand
who you are investing your cash with and you do pay a fee".

The fee covers features such as cheque book and BPAY access to the account. The
fee to access Macquarie's CMT is 1.1 per cent.

There is also a range of managed funds comprising cash securities that deliver a
return above the bank bill swap rate investors can access.

The BT Premium Cash Fund is one example. It invests in a range of different cash
securities and, according to Ryan, has hardly been affected by the sub-prime
crisis.

The interest rate this fund pays has risen from 6.76 per cent at the end of 2007
to 7.52 per cent at the end of April 2008.

Ryan says some cash funds, for example the Ord Minnett Premium Yield Fund, have
suffered due to the sub-prime crisis.

This fund has delivered a return of -15.8 since the start of the year.

Despite the sub-prime effect, higher interest rates mean the relative
attractiveness of low volatility investments such as cash also rises.

In the current climate of high volatility in global markets, it is likely cash
-based investments will continue to grow in popularity.

Liquid Assets

* Inflation will eat away at cash accounts over time.

* Retirees can have a growth strategy with a twist.

* You can invest in cash through on-call accounts, term deposits, online
accounts and cash management trusts and funds.

Amazon's voracious cash appetite

                             June 18, 2001, Monday

Its cash flow statement reveals it is haemorrhaging cash, making it highly
likely it will soon need another large injection soon

ONE of the doyens of the new economy, Amazon.com, is struggling to break even.
But perhaps of more immediate concern is the fact that it is a voracious
consumer of cash even after recent "belt tightening". That and other nuggets of
information are revealed in an examination of Amazon.com's cash flow statement.

Cash flow reporting is nothing new. Way back in 1977 the International
Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) issued IAS 7, Cash Flow Statement. This
was duly adopted as an accounting standard here in Singapore. It requires all
but small companies to produce a cash flow statement.

Cash flow reporting has typically taken a back seat to the reporting of profit.
Recently though many analysts have singled it out for special attention. There
are many possible reasons. First, in an economic downturn -- such as the one we
are experiencing now -- concerns are raised over whether a company will survive,
never mind make money.

Cash is a company's lifeblood. When it runs out the company "goes to the wall".
Second, there are many loss-making New Economy companies desperate to break
even. Many of these have succumbed to the temptation to manipulate their
results. Manipulating profit is not difficult. Cash, on the other hand, is
virtually impregnable from fiddling. And it is easy for the lay-person to
understand.

The cash flow statement reports the company's flows of cash into "sources" and
out of "uses" in a given period. The objective of IAS 7 is to provide
information on changes in cash and cash equivalents -- investments which can
quickly and easily be turned into cash. It classifies cash flows into three
categories -- operating activities, investing activities, and financing
activities.

The cash flow statement does many things. It shows whether the operating
activities produce a positive cash flow, whether the overall activities yield a
positive cash flow and the manner in which such activities have been funded.
Moreover, it serves as a mechanism for assessing the current liquidity of a
business, or how easily it can pay its debts, and it helps in the estimation of
future cash flows.

Operating activities represent the normal trading activities of the company. In
Amazon's case -- its cash flow statement for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
can be found by going to http://www.amazon.com/exec/
obidos/subst/misc/company-info.html, clicking on "investor relations" and then
going to "10-Q" for first quarter 2001 -- the cash flows shown under this
section are those arising, largely, from the retailing of books and so on over
the Internet.

Investing activities include the purchase of non-current assets, which are
assets you intend keeping for continued use in the business, proceeds from the
sale of such assets, and investments bought and sold. Finally, financing
activities include proceeds on the issue of shares and taking out of loans and
the cash used in repaying loans.

When Amazon.com released its first quarter results for 2001 the company boasted
that its net loss had dropped from US$308 million for the first quarter of 2000
to US $234 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001. What it failed to
highlight -- and what is borne out by a perusal of its cash flow statement -- is
that it started 2001 with US$822 million in cash and cash equivalents and has
used US$375 million to leave it with US$447 million at March 31, 2001.

Its burn rate -- the rate it is consuming cash through its operating activities
-- is around US$135 million per month versus US $107 million per month for the
same period last year. Rather than slowing, as we would hope, the rate has
actually accelerated. And at this rate it looks set to run out of cash by the
end of this month! The only crumb of comfort is that the acceleration in burn
rate is partly down to paying suppliers more quickly.

The investing section confirms that some belt tightening is taking place. In
particular, there is little in the way of fixed asset purchases in 2001. In fact
this section -- where one normally sees a company using cash -- is actually cash
positive for the first quarter 2001 due to Amazon selling a large chunk of its
investments, including treasury bonds, to yield US$94 million in cash.

Essentially investments are being liquidated to make good the haemorrhaging of
cash at the operating level. But the supply of investments, a temporary
"housing" for the huge sums borrowed in 2000 is fast drying up. The financing
section reveals US$680 million borrowed in the first quarter 2000 alone, though
this has dropped to a trickle in 2001.

Now, in the short run, a company can finance operating cash deficits by selling
investments and raising more money from investors and banks. But one day the
company has to become cash positive at the operating level. Only then can it
start repaying its debts and paying dividends to its shareholders. For Amazon,
that day still looks an increasingly long way off. And it may never come. That
would be a shame.

Consumers regard Amazon.com as the darling of the Internet. Unfortunately,
shareholders are less pleased. Cash is flowing out of Amazon.com at an alarming
rate. This makes it highly likely it will need another large injection of cash
from the capital markets or banks before long. Let's hope they oblige. If not
Jeff Bezos will be on the lookout for a "white knight". And he will need to
convince potential white knights that his business model can please shareholders
as well as it does consumers.

I-T - Whether re-deposit of liquid cash warrants any addition to assessee's
total income, if same was kept in hand with an intention to purchase property
and to meet pressing expenditure demands - NO: ITAT

BYLINE: TIOL News Service

LENGTH: 601  words


KOCHI, NOV 11, 2016: THE ISSUE IS -Whether re-deposit of liquid cash by an
assessee in his bank account warrants any addition to his total income, if it
has been sufficiently proved that such liquid cash kept with an intention
topurchase a property and to meet the pressing expenditure demands. NO IS THE
VERDICT.

Facts of the case:

Theassessee is an individual deriving salary and agricultural income. For the AY
2009-10, he had return his return declaring the taxable income of Rs. 2,48,033/-
and agricultural income of Rs. 4 lacs. The assessment was taken up for scrutiny
by issuing notice u/s 143(2). The scrutiny assessment u/s 143(3) was completed
vide order dated 14.12.2011, by fixing the total income at Rs. 27,56,630/- and
agricultural income at Rs 4 lacs. One of the additions made by AO was the
addition u/s 69. As per the AIR information, it was noticed by AO that the
assessee had made cash deposits amounting to Rs. 18,28,500/- during the period
1.4.2008 to 31.3.2009. AO asked the assessee to furnish the source of funds for
making cash deposits. The assessee filed the details of source of funds. The
source of cash deposits, as submitted by the assessee, was reproduced in the
assessment order. Out of the cash deposits of Rs. 18,36,000/-, AO was of the
view that source for Rs.14,92,000/- has not been explained properly. Further,
according to AO, the source of cash deposits of Rs. 2,08,000/- in the loan
account no.3580, was also remained unexplained. AO directed the assessee to show
cause as to why the cash deposits of Rs. 17,03,000/- should not be treated as
unexplained investment u/s 69. In response to the show cause notice issued by
AO, assessee submitted a reply.AO admitted that there was sufficient cash
withdraws from the Federal Bank account. However, AO held that these cash
withdrawals would not be available with the assessee for making the cash
deposits. AO thus rejected the assessee's contention that cash deposits are out
of withdrawals from 1.7.2008 to 23.7.2008. On appeal, CIT(A) confirmed the
addition made by AO.

On appeal, the ITAT held that,

++ the assessee had produced the cash flow statement before AO. In the cash flow
statement, all the inflows including the above inflow of Rs. 12,23,000/-as well
as the bank withdrawals are clearly depicted. The cash flow statement submitted,
according to me has tallied and there is no error. The source of cash deposits,
according to the assessee, are out of cash withdrawals in the month of July 2008
from assessee's Federal bank account no.3282, which were re-deposited on various
days as per the details given in cash flow statement. The reasoning for
disbelieve the source of deposits of cash is that the withdrawals in the month
of July 2008 could not be available with the assessee for these cash deposits.

++ the assessee had originally intended to purchase 12.586 cents of land as per
the agreement, which did not materialize even though the validity of the
agreement was extended. Finally, the agreement got lapsed. Subsequently, the
vendor sold 6 cents out of 12.40 cents for higher price for which a separate
sale agreement was executed. The assessee with the intention to purchase the
balance property was continuing to negotiate with the seller, keeping the cash
in hand. However, on various occasions, to meet the pressing expenditure
demands, portion of the cash in hand were re-deposited into the bank account.
Thus the reasons for keeping the cash in hand and periodical deposits of cash in
the said bank account, is justified and addition u/s 69 is not warranted in the
facts and circumstances of the case.

12, 1999, still remained unsettled and/or partially settled as of November 30,
2015. Of the said amount, P163,626,948.67 represented the top 100 extracted
amounts ranging from P500,000.00 to P53 million," the auditors said.

"Further, cash advances were granted to Accountable Officers (AO) even if their
previous cash advances have not yet been liquidated/settled, contrary to
Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of COA Circular No. 97-002 dated February 10, 1977,"
the report added.

Under COA Circular No. 97-002, which contains guidelines on the grant and use of
cash advances, a cash advance must be reported as soon as it has served its
purpose.

It also provides that any official or employee should have first settled or made
a proper accounting of the previous cash advance given to him before he is
allowed additional cash advances.

The auditors noted that cash advances had been granted to several AOs even if
their previous cash advances had not yet been settled or liquidated.

"However, we also noted that for CY [Calendar Year] 2016, Management issued a
Minute Resolution that no cash advances shall be granted to AOs with
unliquidated cash advances," they said.

The audit team recommended that the Comelec require the Accounting Division to
examine and update the Aging Schedule of Receivables to identify those whose
cash advances remain unsettled or partly settled "and demand the immediate
liquidation thereof."

It also told the poll body to require the division to "strictly comply with COA
Circular No. 97-002 by monitoring cash advances and requiring the concerned AOs
to liquidate their cash advances promptly; and by avoiding the granting of cash
advances to AOs with previous unliquidated cash advances."

Another recommendation was for the Accounting Division to consider withholding
the salaries of employees with outstanding cash advances.

The Comelec "commented that for CY 2016, they have strictly complied with COA
Circular No. 97-002 in the granting of cash advances to AOs by not issuing
additional cash advances to those who did not comply with the proper accounting
of their previous cash advances."

It is also preparing demand letters for those with unliquidated cash advances,
based on the audit report.

"Considering that CY 2016 is an election year, Management exerted its best
effort to limit the issuance of additional cash advances. As compared to the
previous practice of resorting to the cash advance system in the payment of
various election expenses such as training and payment of honoraria of poll
workers and Comelec employees, a substantial amount of these expenses was paid
directly to creditors," the poll body said.

"As practiced regularly, Management is exerting its best effort to reconcile the
balances between the Aging Schedule of Cash Advances and the GL [general ledger]
balances," the Comelec said.

FASB PROPOSES CHANGES FOR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Norwalk, Conn. - The Financial Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task
Force has proposed an accounting standards update for how certain cash receipts
and cash payments would be classified on the statement of cash flows.

Various stakeholders have told FASB that there is some diversity in practice in
how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The proposed ASU addresses eight specific issues to
reduce that diversity in practice. For example, FASB acknowledged there is no
specific guidance on the classification of cash payments for debt prepayment or
extinguishment costs. Under the update, cash payments for debt prepayment or
extinguishment costs would be classified as cash outflows for financing
activities.

Another issue involves the settlement of zero-coupon bonds. Stakeholders told
FASB there is no specific guidance on the classification of the cash payment
made by a bond issuer at the settlement of a zero-coupon bond. Under the
proposed solution, the portion of the cash payment attributable to the accreted
interest would be classified as cash outflows for operating activities at
settlement, and the portion of the cash payment attributable to the principal
would be classified as cash outflows for financing activities.

Another issue involves the lack of guidance on the classification of cash
payments made by an acquirer after a business combination for the settlement of
a contingent consideration liability. Under the update, cash payments made by an
acquirer that are not paid soon after a business combination for the settlement
of a contingent consideration liability would be separated and classified as
cash outflows for financing activities and operating activities. Cash payments
up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the
acquisition date would be classified as financing activities, while any excess
would be classified as operating activities.

Other issues for which FASB is proposing solutions in the ASU involve proceeds
from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of
corporate-owned and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received
from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization
transactions, and the application of the predominance principle in separately
identifiable cash flows.

FASB is asking for comments on the exposure draft by March 29, 2016.

Xero Adds Statement of Cash Flows Report

BYLINE: Danielle Lee

SECTION: ACCOUNTING TECHNOLOGY Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 205  words


Xero released a statement of cash flows report, a flexible way for users to
generate a report summarizing the cash flow of a business and informing
decisions around cash flow management.

The cash flow statement looks at all cash receipts and cash expenditure,
grouping money going in and out of the user's business into useful categories.

Additionally, the statement of cash flows enables Xero users to answer critical
questions about their cash, like whether they are generating a cash surplus and
if a cash drop is due to certain investments.

The cash flow statement breaks down into three sections:

     ·    Cash flows from operating activities, showing what cash has come in
          and gone out as a result of business activities
     ·    Cash flows from investing activities, including payments for new
          assets and receipts from the sale of assets and investments made
     ·    Cash flows from financing activities, showing any loan repayments,
          proceeds from new loans or money invested in or taken out of the
          business


Users can modify the layout of the statement of cash flows report using the drag
and drop interface. The report can also be split into its debits and credits
using the layout editor.

More information about the report is available in the Xerohelp center.

Versatile heart of a portfolio;
CASH MANAGEMENT TRUSTS

BYLINE: John Wasiliev

SECTION: SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 1220 words


Cash management trusts can play many important roles in a portfolio and
financial planners recommend them as handy portfolio management tools. John
Wasiliev writes.

One development in funds management over the last five years has been a growing
number of interest-paying funds that use the term cash in their description.

What is worth noting about them, says Anthony Sirhan, head of consulting at
funds management researcher Morningstar, is that not many of the new funds are
traditional cash management trusts.

The trend in new cash funds is toward investments that describe themselves as
cash-enhanced or cash-plus funds.

These have differences that investors looking for a CMT must be familiar with.

The new regime of cash funds are actively managed funds with a wider range of
interest-paying investments in their portfolios as well as a different risk
profile to CMTs.

The traditional CMTs on the other hand are a more vanilla type of investment,
says David Collins, director of fund services at rating agency Standard & Poors
in Melbourne.

They are also the more popular investment, starting with the $9.5 billion
Macquarie CMT which pioneered these investments in 1980. Today the vanilla CMT
sector is a $25 billion market of which about $18 billion is in retail funds.

Over the 24 years since their introduction in 1980, traditional cash trusts have
developed into more than just investment vehicles, although at times they have
been among the most exciting.

In the 1980s, for example, when interest rates were in double digits and cash
went through a purple patch, cash trusts held their own with returns of 18 per
cent and better in 1989, 1986 and 1982. While cash was never the top performing
investment category during this golden period, it came close.

However, in 1994, when virtually every other financial sector crashed, cash,
with a better than 5 per cent return, led the field, showing its defensive
qualities as an investment.

Having some holdings in cash investments is part of portfolio diversification,
especially with more conservative portfolios, Sirhan says.

But cash also serves other purposes.

It provides liquidity, which is essential in a retirement portfolio, paying an
income stream such as a self-managed superannuation fund.

It provides the opportunity to make new investments. Cash is an asset category
that many investors build up during periods of market uncertainty. Smart
investors then move from cash to more market-driven investments such as shares,
property and fixed instruments.

Not that cash doesn't have a market link. The market that CMTs focus on, Collins
says, is the money market. In fact, in the US, CMTs are described as money
market funds.

Traditional CMTs are of particular interest to Standard & Poor's given that it
rates them. The S& P rating for cash trusts is AAAm and only funds that are run
along guidelines set down by the agency can obtain this classification.

A pure CMT is permitted to have only short-term money market investment that are
rated A1 plus or A1, which are the highest categories for these investments.
Ninety-day bank bills issued by the top four banks fit this definition.

"The idea of AAAm-rated cash funds is that investors know they are buying into a
fund where the assets will have extremely high credit quality," Collins says.
This means that the risks of suffering a loss are highly unlikely for an
investor in a CMT.

Another feature of CMTs is that they earn a reasonable return, although in terms
of performance the new cash-enhanced or cash-plus funds should outperform them.
In exchange for perhaps slightly lower performance, CMT investors should expect
more stable and more secure returns. Not that cash enhanced or cash plus funds
are necessarily that much more risky.

As part of its rating process, S&P tracks the weighted average maturity of the
cash trust portfolio with a requirement that is be no more than 70 days.

The actual average for cash trusts tends to be in the region of 45 days,
although it does vary as the S&P chart shows.

S &P does a monthly assessment of CMT portfolios in which it also examines the
diversity of the portfolio. "We don't like to see all the eggs in the one
basket," Collins says.

Adequate liquidity is another consideration as cash trusts must cope with a
regular stream of redemptions. While the maximum weighted average maturity is 70
days, having about 10 per cent of the fund invested in interest paying
securities that mature within seven days is a required feature.

Collins says that S & P uses guidelines similar to those in the US to rate cash
management funds. Issues such as the weighted average maturity are important
because the longer the maturity profile of the investments in the fund, the more
interest rate risk there is.

Interest rate risk is a particular concern during times of rising interest
rates.

Collins says that what investors in interest investments need to know is that
when cash funds not necessarily CMTs pay a much higher rate of interest, it is
generally because more risky investments are being bought. For instance, some
cash plus and cash enhanced funds invest in such assets as longer-dated
debentures or hybrid investments such as higher-yielding income securities.

These funds would not be classified as AAAm CMTs. Many non-CMT funds are really
short-dated bond funds. They should offer higher return because either credit
quality or duration vary.

Collins says it is likely that a broader variety of fixed interest funds will
continue to come onto the market but they shouldn't really be compared against
CMTs.

Sirhan says investors should be aware of the different types of so-called cash
funds and how they can fit into a portfolio.

In the current low-interest-rate environment, some investors with reasonable
cash holdings for portfolio reasons may choose to diversify their holdings
between traditional CMTs and cash-enhanced or cash-plus funds.

"But they should know they are buying something different and they need to look
behind the labels," he adds.

But for investors who want absolute security with liquidity: this is offered by
traditional CMTs.

As well as a competitive returns, these vehicles also often offer bank-style
facilities such as a cheque book, automated teller machine access and internet
banking.

For those who want these facilities, they should be aware that there will most
likely be costs involved.

Cash trusts are often recommended by financial planners as portfolio management
tools. They recommend cash trusts as a hub for investment portfolios, to collect
payments from different investment assets such as share dividends and managed
fund dividends as well as the proceeds from the sale of investments.

As most of these events happen electronically, cash management statements can
provides investors with an important record of these transactions.

They can be useful for structures such as self-managed super funds where record
keeping is important.

Souped up

* Many cash management trusts today have evolved.

* They are actively managed, have a wider range of interest-paying investments
and a different risk profile.

* CMTs provide liquidity to a portfolio and the opportunity to make new
investments.

* CMTs can be portfolio management tools, by acting as a hub for investment
portfolios, to collect payments from investments as well as the proceeds of
sales.

Cash injury shock

BYLINE: LEO SCHLINK

LENGTH: 456 words


Pat Cash's Australian Open prospects last night were dealt

a savage blow when an arm injury caused the Victorian to withdraw

from the Rio International Challenge final at Memorial Drive.

Hampered by a lack of movement in his right arm and elbow,

Cash could not continue after bravely extending Wimbledon champion

Stefan Edberg to 6-all in the first set.

Edberg, 22, was awarded the championship, in hollow fashion,

after just 47 minutes' play.

The extent of Cash's injury is unknown.

Neither Cash, 23, nor his coach Ian Barclay would comment on

the problem after the match. However, his father, Pat Cash Snr

assured reporters Cash would compete in the Australian open.

It is believed the pair will assess the injury in Melbourne

later today.

Norwood Football Club physiotherapist, Max Pfitzner, who treated

Cash, said the 1987 Wimbledon champion's problems had flared

"when he mis-hit a ball."

Constantly beset with injury throughout his career, Cash's

discomfort first surfaced during the initial service game.

At best, Cash's normally blistering service, which recently

has been modified, was pedestrian, allowing Edberg a rare opportunity

to return with comfort.

Cash's problem was further accentuated after his Swedish opponent

broke the Victorian's soft delivery in the fifth game.

The powerfully-built right-hander then conferred with Barclay,

his father, Pat Cash senior, and Rio organiser, Graeme Hannan

during a change of ends.

Clearly

in pain

Wincing and clearly in pain, Cash was then treated by Pfitzner,

who applied spray and strapping to alleviate pain caused by

a "reverse tennis elbow problem".

But after reaching 6-all, a bitterly frustrated Cash clearly

could not perservere with victory aspirations in an exhibition

event with the Australian Open just two days away.

Distressed, Cash quickly left the court, headed for the changerooms

and ice treatment. Recently recovered from severe achilles tendon

and leg problems, Cash has experienced soreness in his right

elbow since returing to match play.

At both last month's Kooyong Invitational and the Swan Gold

Hopman Cup in Perth this month, Cash has constantly applied

ice and rubber sleeves to the limb.

Seeded 13th for the Australian Open, Cash has overcome adversity

many times to establish his position in world tennis.

A severe back injury cost Cash 18 months on the international

circuit and was followed by critical knee injuries.

Achilles tendon and leg afflictions precluded Cash from competing

for four months late last year.

Since his return to match play, Cash had remained undefeated

until losing, in three sets, to world No. 1 Mats Wilander at Memorial Drive

on Friday night.

Cash flow takes an SEC hit: The story of the Caterpillar that lost its cash

BYLINE: Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones

SECTION: FINANCIAL POST; Pg. FP15

LENGTH: 1179  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK - It's clear now that at some companies, operating cash flow literally
isn't what it used to be.

Major companies like Caterpillar Inc., General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
have recently slashed their previously reported numbers for operating cash flow
in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's stance that they've been
incorrectly categorizing their vendor financing for cash-flow purposes. The
change has been expected for weeks, but now that annual reports have been filed
and the numbers are out, it's an eye-opener to see the extent of what the SEC
has wrought.

GM has cut its consolidated operating cash flow by US$9-billion over a two-year
period. Ford cut its figures by US$8.2-billion over two years. The two-year
reduction at Caterpillar: US$14-billion, more than wiping out all its
consolidated operating cash flow for the period. Several other companies have
also revised their cash-flow numbers in response to the SEC, albeit by lower
amounts.

The revisions, atop a previous, similar reduction by General Electric Co., lend
support to the idea that operating cash flow can be cluttered up just like
earnings, and isn't necessarily the truer, pristine measure of a firm's
performance that some investors think it is.

"It's at times difficult to trust what companies are saying operating cash flow
is," said Charles Mulford, a Georgia Institute of Technology accounting
professor who heads a financial-analysis lab that's credited with drawing the
SEC's attention to the issue.

Some companies like Caterpillar and GM, while acknowledging they've revised
their cash-flow totals at the SEC's behest, downplay the significance of the
changes. They note the revisions affect only the cash flow reported by the
entire company, not the figures for their individual manufacturing and finance
units, which is what they say investors care about.

"This reclassification has no impact on our business health or profitability,"
said Dave Burritt, Caterpillar's chief financial officer.

The SEC's concerns hinge on the treatment of the receivables -- money owed to
the company -- that are generated when a company provides loans or other
financial assistance to its dealers to help them buy products out of the
company's inventory. Many large auto and heavy-equipment companies have their
own finance subsidiaries that provide such help.

Until now, companies tended to classify these finance receivables in the
investing part of the cash-flow statement. Since an increase in receivables
equates to a decline in cash flow, the receivables reduced investing cash flow
but didn't affect operating cash flow, a much more important and closely
scrutinized part of the cash-flow statement.

Recently, the SEC said that's wrong. The commission's staff sent letters to a
handful of companies and posted a sample letter on its Web site to alert others,
indicating that these receivables belong in operating cash flow, because they
stem from an operating transaction -- the sale of the autos or other equipment.
The SEC said it wanted the companies to revise their previously reported cash
-flow numbers, shifting often-negative amounts to operating cash flow from
investing cash flow.

By far the biggest impact came at Caterpillar, where operating cash flow flipped
to negative from positive for 2002 and 2003 because of the revision. Caterpillar
revised its 2002 figure to negative US$4-billion from the initially reported
positive US$2.3-billion-plus, a decline of US$6.3-billion. Similarly, the firm
changed its 2003 figure to negative US$5.6-billion from positive US$2.1-billion,
a decline of US$7.7-billion.

Caterpillar's operating cash flow is suffering harshly in part because its
finance receivables go into an off-balance-sheet entity, and Caterpillar
receives "retained interests" in the receivables, not cash, in exchange for a
portion of them. In its annual report, Caterpillar said accounting rules dictate
that its collections on those retained interests must be treated as an investing
transaction, rather than an operating transaction, and that results in a
"significant" shift in cash flow away from operating and to investing.

Mr. Burritt said Caterpillar's financial position and cash flow "remain strong"
and noted that cash flow was strong enough for Caterpillar in 2004 to boost its
dividend, buy back shares and contribute more than US$650-million to its pension
plans.

GM, meanwhile, cut its 2002 operating cash flow to US$11.1-billion from the
previously reported US$15.5-billion, a reduction of US$4.4-billion. For 2003,
the figure was changed to just under US$3-billion from the previous
US$7.6-billion, a reduction of US$4.6-billion.

Toni Simonetti, a GM spokeswoman, said the old classification method that didn't
hurt operating cash flow was widely regarded as acceptable practice before the
SEC stepped in, but that "we of course are complying" with the SEC's concerns.
She also said investors focus more on the sector cash flows from the company's
automotive and financing units that aren't changing because of the
reclassification. "At our company, the significance of this is not that great,"
she said.

Ford cut its 2002 operating cash flow to US$11.7-billion from US$17.8-billion, a
reduction of more than US$6-billion. For 2003, the company revised its figure to
US$17.3-billion from US$19.4-billion, down more than US$2.1-billion. (Ford also
provided revised figures for 2004, in which it said the revision caused a
US$1.9-billion increase in operating cash flow.)

Harley-Davidson Inc., meanwhile, cut its 2002 operating cash flow by
US$230.1-million and its 2003 figure by US$272.9-million -- smaller cuts than
Caterpillar, GM and Ford, but significant for Harley-Davidson in percentage
terms. A spokesman said the company wouldn't comment beyond the disclosure in
its annual report.

While most companies affected by the change are seeing declines in operating
cash flow, that doesn't have to be the case. Textron Inc. revised its 2002
operating cash flow upward by US$50-million and its 2003 figure upward by
US$127-million. That can happen, Prof. Mulford says, when a company collects
more on receivables from past transactions than it's generating in receivables
on new transactions, producing a positive cash-flow effect that's now credited
to operating cash flow because of the SEC's guidance.

Karen Gordon, a Textron spokeswoman, said the company securitizes much of its
loans. In this case, that meant quicker collections of cash that outstripped new
transactions and resulted in the positive impact in Textron's revision, though
she said that was "completely a matter of timing."

The revisions largely validate Prof. Mulford; most of the companies revising
their past numbers had been cited by his financial-analysis lab nearly a year
ago as prime candidates for such a move.

Prof. Mulford said the SEC is getting more diligent about making sure companies
toe the line in reporting their cash flow. There's been so much flexibility in
the cash-flow accounting rules, he said, "so little specific guidance, that the
grey areas are great."

Making a case for cash

LENGTH: 686  words

DATELINE: Mumbai


Mumbai, March 26 -- In a world of mobile wallets, debit, credit and prepaid
cards, not to mention bitcoins, cash may seem un-cool. But in a recent report,
Cash Essentials - Beyond payments, Guillaume Lepecq, founder of AGIS Consulting,
brings out the various dimensions of cash, and shows that other instruments do
not match the many attributes of cash.


 Would you think there are vested interests at play in promoting cashless
societies?
 Several groups have an interest in displacing cash. One, a number of companies
offer alternative payment solutions and are eager to capture some of those
transactions. Two, cash protects consumers' privacy and freedom. For various
reasons - marketing, tax evasion, or even security - organisations may prefer to
restrict this freedom.
 Lastly, some say that eradicating cash will enable central banks to apply
negative interest rates. But if banks start applying negative interest rates,
then savings will start flowing out of the bank system.
 Who may be some groups of people for whom cash may continue to play a key role?

 Cash is probably the most widely used product in the world. If I were to
highlight three groups, it would be women, as they suffer more from financial
exclusion than men. For these vulnerable groups, cash is the only alternative.
Two, victims of disasters find that cash has demonstrated its robustness and
resilience in times of emergency. Three, counter-intuitively, millennials prefer
cash and recent research highlights this. (Millennials refers to those born from
early 80s to early 2000, who came of age in the new millennium)
 Cash means privacy and opens up tax evading transaction possibilities. How can
these be handled?
 Cash payment is certainly anonymous, but in many countries regulations aim to
curb tax evasion and money laundering. There are caps on payments in cash and
certain transactions may not be settled in cash. Just the bulkiness of cash is a
limitation - $1 million in $100 bills weighs 10 kg. Cash is not the only way to
do private transactions - bitcoins, anonymous prepaid card, gold and foreign
currency also serve the purpose. Billions of people are using cash the right
way, a few may not be.
 Has the global financial crisis (GFC) changed people's perception of cash?
 The GFC has reminded us that cash has numerous functions. One function is the
store of value. A significant share of cash is hoarded. Another is the
contingency role. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the GFC has led to an
increase in demand for currency, not only in the US but in countries such as
Australia which were relatively immune.
 Is there a divide between developed and developing economies in cash usage?
 The main divide is the development of banking infrastructure. Developed
countries have a dense network of bank branches and ATMs which facilitate
circulation and velocity of cash. However, we have seen considerable innovation
in developing countries, which could well leap-frog technologies - M-Pesa in
Kenya is often recognised as one of the key innovations in payments. It is
essentially a cash transfer system using mobile phones and a network of over
60,000 agents.
 Transporting cash comes with costs. There is also the issue of counterfeits. Is
this why other payment modes are preferred?
 The cost of payments is significant. The European Central Bank estimated it
averages 1 per cent of GDP. Worldwide, this amounts to roughly $760 billion per
year - larger than the airline industry. The overall cost of cash is in line
with its share of the market as a payment instrument. And cash is, often, the
most efficient payment instrument, particularly for low-value transactions.
 Your views on moving to bitcoin and other such non-cash currencies.
 We are seeing great innovation in terms of new payment instruments: cards,
contact-less, mobile payment and crypto currencies. Digital currencies may have
a future but they also face several significant challenges. They are unregulated
in some cases, depend on infrastructure and are complex to use and lack
convenience. In any case, I do not believe digital currencies will replace cash.

Cashing in on undervalued stock;
Some investors find good purchases in companies with healthy cash piles

BYLINE: Yasmine Yahya

SECTION: MONEY

LENGTH: 507 words


WITH no end in sight to the problems plaguing the euro zone, the market has been
taken over by an extreme case of the jitters.

Yet, astute investors have identified some gems amid the chaos, and have waded
into the market to make selective purchases.

Businessman Oei Hong Leong, for one, bought 20.8 million shares in trading firm
Intraco, upping his stake in the company to 21.12 per cent.

'There is good value in certain shares and many undervalued stocks,' he told The
Straits Times.

One factor that attracted him to Intraco was its healthy cash pile, he added.

Analysts say there are indeed quite a number of companies that are now
undervalued and sitting on robust amounts of cash.

Many of these are cheaper than blue chips, so would not require a very big
capital outlay.

One way to spot these companies is by looking at the amount of net cash they
have, and comparing it to their overall market capitalisation.

Net cash can be calculated by deducting the company's outstanding loans from its
total 'cash and cash equivalents'.

Some companies provide this figure in their quarterly results announcements.

Venture Corp, for example, stated in its latest results presentation that it had
a balance cash amount of $306.4 million at the end of March, after deducting
loans of $170 million from its total cash pile.

That is about 14 per cent of its current market capitalisation of $2.15 billion,
which is a healthy amount and not too high, said DMG & Partners Research head
Terence Wong.

'You don't want a company that is just sitting on a lot of cash. If the cash
pile is 40 or 50 per cent of their market cap, that is too rich,' he said.

'You want a company that is deploying part of its cash, either by paying out
dividends or acquiring new businesses, so that investors could get good
returns.'

Besides the net cash position, analysts also determine a company's worth from
its operating cash flow.

And they typically project the company's future cash flow to see whether it
would be able to maintain dividend payouts, said CIMB analyst Jonathan Ng.

'A company's cash pile will increase if it is consistently able to generate
positive free cash flow,' he said.

'Free cash flow' is the figure derived after deducting a company's capital
expenditure from its operating cash flow.

Simply put, free cash flow represents the amount of cash that a company could
generate after spending on the maintenance or expansion of its assets, such as
properties and equipment.

One company that has impressed analysts with its strong cash flow is Sheng
Siong.

The supermarket operator pledged it would pay out 90 per cent of its net profit
in dividends last year and this year, but Maybank Kim Eng analysts said the firm
could likely continue doing so beyond this time frame.

'An examination of its working capital requirement, overall cash flow and
gearing convinces us that the group is well able to maintain a high payout going
forward.'

Enhanced cash funds aren't always what they seem and may be riskier than you
think, writes Jonathan Barrett.

They are marketed as run of the mill cash funds with a little extra kick. So,
why did several enhanced cash funds lose money in the September quarter?

Unlike cash funds, which tend to have minimal differences in the assets they
hold and the performance they deliver, the make-up of enhanced cash funds varies
widely.

Research house Morningstar says the complexity of income-producing funds has
increased considerably, which means investors need to better understand what
they are invested in, and income managers need to be more transparent.

"The universe of these funds has changed dramatically in recent years. We've
seen an increase in the diversity and complexity of funds being offered to
Australian investors," Morningstar says.

Fund managers are relying on an investor appetite for high-yielding investments,
and most now offer several types of cash fund. The credit crunch stripped
one-third from Perpetual's first-half profit forecast after its Exact and
Enhanced Cash Funds shed value.

Those enhanced cash funds that delivered positive returns during the volatile
September quarter were generally invested in large amounts of cash, and small
levels of more complex fixed-income investments.

ING's Optimix Enhanced Cash Fund, for example, had 85 per cent of its portfolio
in cash, with the remainder in Australian fixed income, before the credit
crunch. The fund gained 1 per cent in the quarter. The United Cash Enhanced Fund
delivered similar returns by investing more than three-quarters of its assets in
cash, and the rest in hybrid securities or fixed interest.

Funds that got caught out in the crunch tended to have a large exposure to the
ailing structured credit market, which had delivered strong returns in recent
years.

Grange Asset Management's enhanced cash fund, which often holds less than 15 per
cent of its assets in cash, fell 0.18 per cent in the quarter. At the end of
September it had 40 per cent of its portfolio in bundles of loans called
collateralised debt obligations, and 50 per cent in asset and mortgage-backed
securities.

Buyers fled the CDO market during the volatile period, creating a liquidity
crisis in the sector that placed downward pressure on the value of credit
instruments.

The managing director of Grange's investment management division, Frank
Sciarrone, says the fund is more like a structured credit product than a cash
fund, and is not mandated to hold large amounts of cash.

The term "enhanced cash" is the cause of many problems for investors, as funds
can use it to describe products with vast differences in their risk profiles.

The UBS Credit Enhanced Cash fund, for example, has more than 60 per cent of its
assets in Australian bonds and 7 per cent in global bonds, according to June 30
data.

Most cash-like funds use the UBSA Bank Bill Index as a benchmark. But if they
hold small amounts of cash, or aim to dramatically outperform the benchmark,
they are unlikely to perform in line with, or have the same risk characteristics
as, cash - regardless of their title.

In the past decade, investors took a hit after being exposed to failed enhanced
cash funds run by Commercial Nominees of Australia and County Investment
Management.

The major problem with the 2001 failure of Commercial Nominees was related to a
so-called enhanced cash fund that promised better than cash returns, but implied
the product had cash management-style low risk. The fund took bigger risks to
generate higher returns by depending on interest repayments from unusual
business ventures such as a mushroom farm and property development. When the
ventures failed, interest was not paid.

Morningstar says the credit crunch shows how important it is to understand the
risk profile of an income fund.

The researcher is revamping its income categories so that it can compare funds
with similar characteristics, regardless of their names.

The Officium Income Fund lost 3 per cent of its value in the six months to
September 30, after getting caught in the sub-prime crisis.

The fund invested 5 per cent of its assets with hedge fund manager Basis
Capital. One of the Basis funds is in provisional liquidation and a second has
lost half its value, after investing in CDOs backed by sub-prime mortgages among
its portfolio of credit assets.

At the end of May, the Officium fund had just 15 per cent of its assets invested
in cash. The fund has since changed its strategy, and increased its cash levels
to 42 per cent.

SHADES OF BLACK;
JOHNNY CASH, IN THE EYES OF 'WALK THE LINE' STARS, DIRECTOR

BYLINE: By Glenn Whipp Film writer

SECTION: U; Pg. U8

LENGTH: 1400 words


Johnny Cash sold millions of copies of greatest-hits compilations during his
lifetime, so the fact that a new collection recently debuted at No. 11 on the
Billboard 200 album chart speaks to the continuing power and relevance of his
music.

``He says so much with so little,'' says Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Cash in the
big-screen biopic ``Walk the Line.'' ``I'm not surprised younger people are
listening to his music, because it has an inherent power and honesty that is
timeless. And the things he sang about, giving voice to people who have no
voice, will always be relevant.''

We spoke to Phoenix, other ``Walk the Line'' cast members and filmmaker James
Mangold about music and memories of the Man in Black.

JOAQUIN PHOENIX

Role: Johnny Cash

Cash connection: Met Cash at a dinner party shortly after Phoenix's movie,
``Gladiator.''

Paid Phoenix his favorite career comment: ``I really loved that 'Gladiator,' ''
Cash told him. ``I really liked the way you said, 'Your wife moaned like a whore
as they ravaged her again and again and again.' ''

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``There's a fierce honesty about John's music that
can't be denied. There's no artifice, no pretension. It's so bare and raw and
feels so intimate. He's like John Lennon. There's something just so beautiful
about somebody being so honest.''

Favorite Cash songs: ``I love 'Home of the Blues.' The lyric `I cry and walk
while my heartbeat keeps time with the drag of my shoes' is fantastic. And
'Folsom Prison Blues.' How do you not like 'Folsom'? 'Cocaine Blues' is a
(bleeping) great song to play. 'I Still Miss Someone' is beautiful. They're all
extraordinary for different reasons.''

SHOOTER JENNINGS

Role: Waylon Jennings (Shooter's dad)

Cash connection: His father's friendship with Cash meant that Jennings knew the
Man in Black from birth. June Carter Cash threw Waylon's sobriety party.
Shooter's mother, singer Jessi Colter, hosted a similar event when Cash stopped
boozing and doping.

``He once told me if there were only two pieces of literature you read in your
life, they should be the Book of Corinthians and the Gettysburg Address,''
Jennings recalls.

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``There's an unbelievable spirituality to it. He never
stopped battling his demons, and you feel that struggle coursing through all of
his songs.''

Favorite Cash songs: `` 'Big River' is probably my favorite song. 'The tears
that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.' Fantastic. Then 'Man
In Black' for the philosophy behind it and the lyrics. And 'Cocaine Blues,' just
for the power, man.''

SHELBY LYNNE

Role: Carrie Cash, Johnny Cash's mother

Cash connection: Wrote the elegiac ``Johnny Met June'' for her own latest album,
``Suit Yourself,'' on the day that Johnny Cash died.

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``I loved his individuality more than anything. I'm a
big fan of people who aren't like anyone else, and Johnny Cash was one of a
kind.''

Favorite Cash songs: ``I recorded 'I Walk the Line' for one of my early
Nashville albums. It's one of the best songs ever written. Then, from the later
albums, the version he did of Trent Reznor's 'Hurt.' But then, I loved
everything from those albums. The song choices were so amazing, and every vocal
sounded really great, like Johnny Cash singing from his age, from his lifetime
of experience.''

WAYLON MALLOY PAYNE

Role: Jerry Lee Lewis

Cash connection: Payne, the son of singer Sammi Smith and Willie Nelson sideman
Jody Payne, knew Cash well. ``Everything he sang was cool. Everything he did was
cool. There will never be another Johnny Cash.''

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``Wanna know about life? Just listen to 'Sunday
Mornin' Comin' Down.' It's all there. Kris (Kristofferson) wrote it. But Johnny
lived it. That's what I recognize John Cash for.''

Favorite Cash songs: ``I loved it when he did 'Hurt.' What a swan song. And that
video he did of that song with June almost foreshadowed what was coming around
the bend. Friends of mine, we used to have parties that would center around us
getting hammered enough to get through one viewing of that video. It was that
intense. It just wrecked everybody.''

TYLER HILTON

Role: Elvis Presley

Cash connection: ``If you want to know how big Johnny Cash and all those guys
were, go to Memphis. Him and Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison, that's
Mount Rushmore right there. If you're playing one of those guys in a movie,
you've got a table in any restaurant at any time.''

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``I didn't really know his music. Then, after I got
the script, I went out and bought the 'Folsom Prison' album. Holy (cow)! I was
blown away.''

Favorite Cash songs: Hilton, 21, stars on the WB series ``One Tree Hill'' and
released his first full-length CD last year. ``I started playing 'Busted' at
some of my shows. It's a great song. I sing 'Jackson' whenever I do a show with
a girl. And I like 'Get Rhythm' and 'I Still Miss Someone.' ''

JAMES MANGOLD

Role: Director, co-writer of ``Walk the Line''

Cash connection: Mangold first met Cash in 1999. They spent many days together
through the years and, after June died in May 2003, Mangold phoned him every
Saturday to talk.

``One of the last times I spoke to him, I asked him what his favorite movies
were,'' Mangold says. ``He said, ' ``Frankenstein.'' He's someone who's made up
of all these bad parts that bad people put together, yet he's very gentle.' He
spoke very quietly. And he added, 'Oh, there's another thing I liked about that
movie.' 'What's that?' And he was very quiet for a moment and then the phone
burst from my ear. 'It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!' It was the huge, full,
booming power of his voice, and then he's laughing like a maniac at the other
end of the line.''

Thoughts on Cash's music: ``There's two essential components - the danger and
the softness, the tenderness. That's why I open with 'Cocaine Blues.' The lyrics
of that are outrageous. They're gangster rap. Then, on the other side, you have
a song like 'I Walk the Line,' a man struggling to be good, promising to be
good, in a world full of temptation.''

Favorite Cash songs: `` 'Get Rhythm.' 'Home of the Blues' is a staggeringly
beautiful song that I don't think people know he wrote. And 'I Still Miss
Someone,' of course. It speaks so much to his character.''

The man behind the voice

Johnny Cash didn't know how to put on a face. There was no artifice, no
affectation to the man. So when it came time to make ``Walk the Line,''
writer-director James Mangold decided he would have Joaquin Phoenix do his own
singing, even though Cash's deep, resonant baritone is one of the most
distinctive voices in music history.

``To me, being authentic trumped being pitch-perfect,'' Mangold says. ``By
denying Joaquin and everyone else the opportunity to be a musician and to really
mean it seemed to be the antithesis of what we were really making the movie
about.''

Phoenix worked with musical consultant T-Bone Burnett (the man behind the rootsy
``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' soundtrack) and a guitar teacher, but it was Cash
himself who helped the actor the most.

``I just listened to his CDs over and over again,'' Phoenix says. ``Singing in
the movie was a terrifying prospect, but as I listened to John's early albums, I
could see he himself was struggling to find himself as a musician. The 'Man in
Black' persona evolved over time. I wanted to capture that process.''

Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon (June Carter Cash), Tyler Hilton (Elvis Presley),
Waylon Malloy Payne (Jerry Lee Lewis), Jonathan Rice (Roy Orbison) and Shooter
Jennings (playing his father, Waylon Jennings) are all featured on the film's
official soundtrack album, singing direct, unadorned versions of classics like
``Ring of Fire,'' ``That's All Right'' and ``Jackson.''

``This is not some twangy, nostalgic movie,'' Mangold says. ``We wanted to make
those early tracks rock. When someone says `the birth of rock 'n' roll,' we want
you to feel what that means, the arrival of this beat, the arrival of this
passion.

``In many ways, the recordings of that period are beautiful, but there's not
enough presence to impress a modern ear,'' Mangold continues. ``What I wanted
people to experience is what you heard when you saw one of these shows in a
gymnasium with the amps turned up all the way. This is music with (power). It's
like a heartbeat. It's as strong as anything you'll ever hear.''

Not all cash investments are created equal;
CASH MANAGEMENT TRUSTS

BYLINE: John Wasiliev

SECTION: SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 833 words


CMTs do not necessarily offer the best return from cash, writes John Wasiliev.

While there is no disputing cash management trusts can be investments in their
own right and are widely used as such, the traditional CMT may not be the best
choice for investors looking for the highest return from an allocation to cash
in their portfolio.

Cash can play an important role in conservative investment portfolios. For
instance, in its LifeStrategy tailored managed fund series, Vanguard Australia
has a conservative portfolio fund option with a 42 per cent allocation to cash.

Cash, as an investment, implies an asset that is liquid, with the entire
proceeds invested able to be withdrawn quickly so as to be available for other
investments. Capital security linked to liquidity is therefore an important
prerequisite.

But Vanguard investment director Eric Smith says that when professional
investors define an allocation to cash, it is unlikely to be one that is managed
along the lines of a cash management trust. It is more likely to be run as a
cash-enhanced fund.

Colonial First State's Warren Bird says that for a diversified investor, a cash
management trust holding should only be there to cover a short-term requirement
for absolute security of capital.

To appreciate the difference between traditional cash management and cash
-enhanced investments, it is useful to understand how CMTs are regarded by a
ratings agency like Standard & Poor's. According to S&P's David Collins, cash
management trusts are rated differently to other fixed interest funds, such as
cash-enhanced funds.

Quite a bit is expected of a cash management fund before it receives S&P's top
AAAm rating. What this rating emphasises is the safety of the overall
investment.

AAAm which most major cash management trusts have implies a superior capacity to
maintain the value of the principal and to limit exposure to loss. It has more
to do with capital safety and less to do with investment return. To obtain the
rating, funds must follow certain guidelines about the assets they invest in and
the terms they hold them for.

There are minimum and maximum guidelines for interest-paying assets that are
deemed to be suitable for cash trusts.

For example, to obtain a AAAm rating, the weighted average maturity of the
portfolio the average term of the investments must be less than seven days, and
10 per cent of investment must mature within seven days to provide sufficient
liquidity.

Government and securities issued by the major banks are the principal
investments of a CMT.

If a cash trust portfolio has an 80-day average maturity, the best rating it can
obtain is AAm.

Collins says that if a fund is rated AAAm, it is going to be a pretty
conservative fund, and the key for people investing in such funds is that they
want a very high degree of certainty that they will get all their money back at
short notice.

A cash-plus fund can also offer a high degree of capital safety, but where they
are different is that investors who want to get out very quickly after they have
entered may experience small negative returns.

Smith says a cash-plus fund is targeted at anyone who might otherwise put their
money into a short-period term deposit for the extra results it can deliver over
a cash investment. Investors in such funds are more interested in performance.

The promise of being able to get your money back within 24 hours means cash-plus
or cash-enhanced trusts carry a risk that there may be a negative return,
although generally only if the investment is held for a very short period.

If the investments are held for a period of six months or longer, there should
be no expectation of a negative return.

What's in a name?

Cash Management Trust: a unit trust like any other managed fund. Investors
purchase units within the trust and the value of their holding is determined by
the trust's unit price. Typically these are managed by investing in money market
investments and distributing all income to unit holders to maintain a constant
unit price of $1 per unit.

Cash Management Account: is operated by a regulated deposit taking institution.
This institution has a legal obligation for the amount invested and the interest
terms offered. It is up to the institution to invest the equivalent funds to
generate a low risk return to cover its obligation to the depositor.

The alternatives

Cash can play an important role in conservative portfolios.

Professional investors favour cash-enhanced funds over CMTs.

Cash-enhanced funds focus on return; CMTs focus on safety.

The ratings game

Standard & Poor's Cash Management Fund ratings are:AAAm (`m' stands for money
market fund) Safety is excellent. Superior capacity to maintain principal value
and limit exposure to loss.AAm Safety is very good. Strong capacity to maintain
principal value and limit exposure to loss.Am Safety is good. Sound capacity to
maintain principal value and limit exposure to loss.BBBm Safety is fair.
Adequate capacity to maintain principal value and limit exposure to loss.

Ready cash finds a home

BYLINE: Peter Freeman

SECTION: WEEKEND REVIEW; Smart Money; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 1139 words


Peter Freeman explores the parking options for liquid investments.

When it comes to holding liquid investments the best option for most people is
fairly simple - put your money in your mortgage, either directly or through an
offset facility.

Provided your lender gives you the right to withdraw it, with little or no
notice, this is the most tax-effective way to hold those funds you want to have
readily available.

Yet for those in the fortunate position of not having a mortgage on the family
home, this strategy is not an option. Instead the choice comes down to cash
management trusts versus cash management accounts.

This choice applies not just to individuals but also to the cash holdings of
do-it-yourself superannuation funds. While some will be actively managed, and so
hold their cash in the form of direct money market investments, most will take
the administratively easy way out and use either a cash trust or cash management
account.

The question is, which option is the better? For most the key determinant will
be the return the various alternatives generate. The accompanying table shows
the annual percentage rate paid by the cash management accounts offered by most
of the major banks and those paid by the 10 biggest cash trusts (including
common funds).

The rates take no account of the frequency with which interest is paid and so
are not effective interest rates. In the case of cash management accounts, this
tends to understate their competitiveness slightly since all but Macquarie and
St George credit interest to your account monthly. In contrast, these two
accounts, as well as most cash trusts, credit interest quarterly.

But even when allowance is made for this there is little doubt that, based on
the accompanying table, cash trusts offer a better return for those with less
than $50,000 to invest. This mainly reflects the fact that they pay the same
rate irrespective of the amount held in the trust.

A study carried out last year by specialist research group ASSIRT came to a
similar conclusion, arguing the returns generated by trusts are significantly
better than the cash management accounts when the amount involved is $20,000 or
less.

"We haven't looked at the issue closely since then but I haven't seen any
developments which would cause us to change this overall conclusion," said
Michael Walsh, research director with ASSIRT.

This view is reinforced by the fact that the cash trusts experienced a huge $2
billion inflow of funds in 1995-96, which pushed their total holdings up by
around 30 per cent. While some of the inflow reflected investor uncertainty, and
so a desire to hold more in cash than previously, it no doubt was also the
result of some investors switching funds from banks to cash trusts in order to
get a better return in today's low interest rate environment.

As the table shows, the differences between the rates paid by cash trusts and
cash management accounts can be substantial, especially on modest amounts.

On $5,000, for example, Citibank's cash management account was paying just 1.49
per cent at the time the table was compiled while the Commonwealth was only
marginally better at 2.5 per cent. Even Macquarie, the top-paying cash account,
was offering only 4 per cent.

This can be contrasted to the much higher rates paid by the cash trusts, which
in recent weeks have ranged from around 5.7 per cent up to almost 6.2 per cent,
in some cases paid on amounts of as little as $1,000.

It is worth noting that some of the accounts surveyed - while paying high rates
and allowing immediate access to funds - don't call themselves cash management
accounts. The Citibank account, for example, is its Investment Account, which
has a higher rate structure than the bank's actual cash management account.
Macquarie's account is called the Cash At Call Account while St George calls its
product the Flexi-Rate Account.

In the case of the cash management trusts, some of those shown are actually
common funds, but the distinction is mainly technical. The ANZ V2 PLUS and
National Australia Bank's fund are the two main examples.

According to Andrew Willink, the head of interest-rate research group Cannex,
the main attraction of cash management accounts is their greater convenience:
"Many not only provide the usual access through the various branch networks but
also provide cheque books and electronic access."

While most cash trusts have some cheque facility attached, most aren't
accessible through a branch network or electronically.

Willink stresses that the only people who can get the best of both worlds - a
high return and maximum convenience - are those with very large amounts they
want to hold as cash. In these situations a cash management account is the
better option.

Possibly the worst aspect of cash trusts is the logistical problems that can
arise when you need to get a bank cheque. Instead of being able to call into
your local branch it is usually necessary to pick up the cheque from the cash
trust's city office. *

Cash Managers Plan Associations As Voice Against US Regulation

                            August 7, 1979, Tuesday

By GARY M. HECTOR

DATELINE: NEW YORK


Cash management professionals, worried that Congress or Federal regulators may
take actions that will constrain cash management techniques, will take steps
this fall to form two parallel national associations that can present the
viewpoints of cash management specialists to concerned government bodies.

At separate meetings in September, bankers, the suppliers of many cash
management services, and corporate treasury officers, the users of these
services, will hold exploratory meetings on forming national associations.  The
resulting organizations would provide a national voice for both suppliers and
users of cash management services.

At a meeting on Sept. 17 in St. Louis a group of corporate cash managers is
slated to discuss a formal affiliation of 18 regional associations of corporate
cash managers.

That meeting has been organized by John G. B. Howland, treasurer of Skil Corp.He
said that all but perhaps one or two of the associations will be represented in
St. Louis and that there is enthusiasm from some participants for a national
association that would be more than a loose affiliation of the regional groups.

Bank cash managers will be discussing a national body during a two-day
conference on cash management in New Orleans on Sept. 12, 13, and 14.

An ad hoc committee has been formed which will meet on the Sept. 13.  David F.
Kvederis, the assistant vice president of Mellon Bank NA, Pittsburgh, who is
chairman of the Bank Administration Institute's first cash management
conference, plans on the first day of the conference to poll bankers about the
need for such an organization.  He also expects bankers to express their views
on the proposal to members of the ad hoc group.

A third organization, Cash Management Institute, which publishes a newsletter
and sponsors conferences on cash management, has volunteered to provide a
meeting ground for members of the two organizations.

The movement toward establishing professional cash management groups has grown
since 1974 when high interest rates and soaring inflation raised the costs of
allowing cash balances to sit idle with banks.  While the trend toward reduced
balances with banks predates 1974, increased inflation, the development of far
deepermoney markets and the introduction of computerized information systems
have raised the potential savings from cash management.

The spread of cash management techniques beyond a tier of extremely large
corporations has spurred the interest of regulators in the effects that
corporate cash managers have on the channelling of the nation's money.

In recent months a number of actions by the Federal Reserve and congress have
convinced many cash managers of the need for a voice for the professionals who
handle corporate cash.

Mr. Kvederis said providing such a voice would be one of the major functions of
a national cash management association.  "We would act as a sounding board for
any outside group that is interested in cash management," he said.  In addition,
he hopes that an association could present regulators with the concerns of cash
managers and suggest research projects that will provide a better understanding
of the flow of money in the U.S.

He said the group would also seek to foster cash management as a profession and
provide a forum for discussion of issues important to cash managers.

The interest among bankers in a national association of cash managers waswhetted
by the formation of groups of users of computerized information systems.  These
services collect data on bank balances of corporations.  Many banks use them to
provide computerized balance reporting services to large corporations.  The user
groups have been meeting for several months to discuss common problems with
their systems, and they have begun to address several national problems of cash
management, such as the need for standards for reporting corporate banking
information.

Mr. Kvederis said the proposed cash management association may affiliate with an
existing banking organization.  But the ad hoc committee will have the option to
decide whether to remain independent or seek a union with an organization such
as BAI or the American Bankers Association.

The corporate group, Mr. Howland said, has less flexibility, as there are no
organizations of corporate treasurers with which they could affiliate.  He
expects that the corporate cash management practitioners would choose to remain
unaffiliated, should they decide to form a national association.

INVESTING IT;
Millions in the Bank, if They Don't Stumble

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRUSH

SECTION: Section 3; Page 6; Column 3; Money and Business/Financial Desk

WITH years of economic growth and restructuring under their belts, many
companies are sitting on mountains of cash. In the auto industry, for instance,
Ford and Chrysler have reserves of $15.4 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively.
And the $17 billion General Motors had in its pocket at the start of 1997 is
$6.8 billion more than it had 12 months earlier. That means G.M. was socking
away about $19 million a day in 1996 -- nearly $1 million an hour.

Such growing piles of dollars have sparked a debate over their import. Many
investors dislike such hoards; companies are businesses, after all, not banks,
they say. But many others welcome the development, particularly in a highflying
market. Not only is the cash a potential cushion if stock prices fall, they say,
but it can also make a stock seem more expensive than it actually is, and thus
perhaps hide some attractively priced investments.

To identify companies that are particularly cash-heavy, The New York Times asked
Compustat, a part of Standard & Poor's, to screen the approximately 430
nonfinancial corporations in the S.& P. 500. Specifically, Compustat subtracted
long-and short-term debt from the cash and cash equivalents of these companies,
and then ranked them by the percentage of their share price that is backed by
this net cash. This measure, calculated at Wednesday's close, can give investors
a good sense of the cash underlying their holdings.

Often, companies that are high on the list have relatively limited needs for
capital. For example, there are King World Productions, which syndicates "The
Oprah Winfrey Show" and other television programs; Novell, the computer software
company, and Biomet, which develops and markets medical devices. These
corporations do spend money on talented people and research, but they are spared
the big, recurring expenses encountered by heavy industries. Indeed, of the 40
screened companies with the least cash as a portion of share prices, about a
dozen are in those prototypical heavy industries, utilities and steel.

Some companies score high simply because they are doing extremely well and their
product cycles are peaking. Compaq Computer, for example, "may be getting so
much money from its successful operations that it is having difficulty putting
that money back to work," said James Solloway, the director of research at Argus
Research.

FOR investors, these cash hoards can mean stock buybacks, higher dividends and
other immediate benefits. But cash-watchers also look for other possibilities.

For example, Neil Hokanson, president of Hokanson Financial Management in
Encinitas, Calif., wonders if Biomet's $139.5 million in cash -- 8 percent of
its Wednesday stock price -- means that the company is getting ready for an
acquisition.

Similarly, Martin Whitman, portfolio manager of the Third Avenue Value fund,
sees the $789 million war chest of Applied Materials as a sign that it can
continue to expand research and to acquire more ventures like Opal Inc. and
Orbot Instruments, which the company recently bought for a total of $285
million. These moves would help Applied Materials stay in the forefront in the
manufacture of semiconductor production equipment, Mr. Whitman said.

Having lots of cash also confers a flexibility that can be of great help in
industries like computers, where competition can push prices lower, said Jack
Church, the portfolio manager of the Glenmede Equity fund. "The average life
cycle of the equipment is short, and they need to have the ability to cut
prices," he said.

Moreover, a cash-heavy balance sheet often means an undervalued stock, in part
because investors often do not analyze the potential uses of cash. Investors
tend to judge companies based on their expected earnings -- and the 3 percent or
so that cash earns after taxes is not impressive to them.

"People often ignore the fact that cash is an asset that can be redeployed in an
efficient way," said Will Browne, a portfolio co-manager of Tweedy Browne's
American and Global funds.

Indeed, cash-rich companies appeal to "value" investors, who are particularly
fond of bargain-priced equities. And it is easy to see why. King World, which
leads the list, has a share price that is 36 percent backed by cash. If that
money is subtracted from the share price -- after all, a dollar of cash should
fetch a dollar in the market, no more, no less -- the stock may be far cheaper
than it appears. At its Wednesday close of $38, for example, King World stock
was trading at 10.12 times its current earnings. But without the cash, the stock
was selling for $24.32 a share. That's just 6.5 times earnings.

Value investors, who are risk-averse as well, also like cash-rich companies
because cash can be insurance against troubled times.

Consider the Boeing Company, which has $3.2 billion in cash. "Boeing can get a
lot of large orders, and then there could be a long time when they are getting
much less cash flow," said Mr. Church, who follows a value strategy. "So it is
really important that they have that cash to see them through."

EVEN the technology companies that are high on the list are wise to have cash on
hand, given the cyclical nature of their products. "Compaq is in such a
competitive, cyclical business," said Mr. Whitman, another value investor. "Five
or six years ago they were in deep trouble and their large cash position saved
them. Cash just gives them staying power in a future that no one can predict."

For Mr. Whitman, a fat wallet is important whatever the industry. "We don't
invest in common stocks unless they have superb balance sheets," he said. "We
want a big margin of safety, because if something goes wrong, the business will
have staying power."

A solid cash position could also support a stock's price in a down market.

"It gets back to the old issue of greed and fear," Mr. Church said.  "Because
the economy and the market are doing well, we are in the greed part of the
cycle. So people are not thinking about cash as a defense, but about how much
better the company could be doing if all the cash were invested. Cash would be
more highly valued in a down economy or a down market."

For example, knowing that 36 percent of King World's share price is backed by
actual dollars can be comforting -- particularly when that percentage is almost
four times as high as that of Bay Networks, the company ranked 10th.

BUT not all investors smile at the sight of plenty of cash in corporate coffers.
Companies should be seizing business opportunities with their cash, not simply
parking the money, they say.

"There is relatively little excuse for sitting around with idle cash on the
balance sheet," said David Beim, a finance professor at the Columbia Business
School. "Anything above 1 percent of annual sales is excess. Anything above 2
percent is really suspect. There are few businesses that need more than that."

By that kind of measurement, Microsoft's $9.16 billion in cash -- it is 17th on
the list -- represents about 97 percent of yearly revenue. And Novell's $1.02
billion equals about 75 percent.

A big amount of cash "is almost a contrary indicator to us," Mr. Hokanson said,
citing Novell as well as Apple, which has $677 million in cash, as examples of
companies that are not effectively redeploying capital.  "Unless there is a
pending acquisition," he said, "we begin to wonder what management is up to."

Indeed, having a lot of cash may not even guarantee that a company will be a
safe investment. If Oprah Winfrey decided not to renew her contract, for
example, King World stock could plummet overnight, despite its large cash
backing. And with Apple's many troubles sending its stock from about $35 at the
start of last year to $17.125 at Wednesday's close, few investors will see much
safety in its cash. Indeed, its $677 million in cash looks almost slim when
Apple's shrinking sales are taken into account. During the year ended September
1995, for example, the company had $11.06 billion in sales. But the next year,
sales were just $9.83 billion.

Still, many people still swear by cash, especially for its insurance value. To
call a high cash position poor management, Mr. Whitman said, "is roughly the
equivalent of saying you wasted your money on fire insurance last year because
your house never burned down."

I-T extends response window for deposit details to February 15

BYLINE: ens economic bureau

LENGTH: 484  words

DATELINE: New Delhi


Extending the date for replying to the queries on cash deposits during the
demonetisation period to February 15, the income tax department has asked people
to declare details of cash donations or gifts of Rs 20,000 or more to reduce the
chances of further scrutiny. In a set of FAQs to answer the queries received
with regard to suspicious deposits made post note ban, the tax department said
assessees should give "explanations" of the source of cash.

If the cash deposited is from multiple sources or arises from cash in hand as on
November 8, the assessee while filing the reply will have to give segregated
details - cash withdrawn from bank, cash received from identifiable persons with
or without PAN, cash received from unidentifiable persons and cash out of
earlier income or savings.

The assessee can also report how much he has deposited or will deposit under the
PMGKY scheme, in which he can pay 50 per cent tax and penalty and come clean. It
said cash received by people exempt from taxes like farm income can be shown
under the head 'cash receipts exempt from tax', only if they are not involved in
business.

"Cash out of receipts exempt from tax is expected to be used for taxpayers not
involved in business who have received cash out of exempt income, for example
agricultural income," the department said. In case the assessee has received
advance salary, the FAQ said he will have to give the name and respective
details of the employer from whom the payment in cash has been received while
filing the response on the I-T portal.

The tax department said that in case the deposits have been made by unknown
persons, the FAQ said the assessee should disclose such deposits with his
remarks in a separate column. In case a taxpayer has deposited someone else's
cash in his account, he will have to disclose the "name and respective details
of the person to whom the cash belongs". With regard to the charitable trusts,
the I-T department said they should disclose source of cash receipts and
donations under various heads like cash withdrawn from bank accounts, received
from identifiable persons with or without PAN and also cash receipt from
unidentifiable persons.

With regard to professionals, it said they should give the details of cash
received from identifiable persons with or without PAN and also from
un-identifiable persons. Also, if the cash receipt is more than Rs 20,000 from a
single person, the details should be furnished.

In case the cash deposited has already been disclosed under the Income
Declaration Scheme, 2016, the amount should be shown under cash out of earlier
income or savings with details. With regard to the money received by petrol
pumps, toll plazas and hospitals which were permitted to receive old notes
beyond November 8, the FAQ said the details of cash sales of business may be
provided. The nature of business will be considered while assessing

the response.

Seek Healthy Cash Flow Numbers To Fine-Tune Your Stock Selection

BYLINE: ANDREW EDWARDS variable, cash flow per share is worth a close look.

SECTION: B; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 497 words


Cash flow matters in the financial world. So while not a core CAN SLIMIBD
Chairman and founder William O'Neil has noted that many fast-growing companies
show full-year operating cash flow per share that's at least 20% greater than
actual earnings per share.

So if a company has annual earnings of $2 a share, look for cash flow from
operations of at least $2.40 a share.

To calculate cash flow from operations, analysts add back non-cash expenses like
depreciation and amortization to a company's net income. Divide by diluted
shares outstanding to get a per-share figure.

In company 10-Q and 10-K filings, the cash flow statement reconciles net income
to actual changes in cash on hand, over a quarterly period or longer. Cash flow
statements typically break down into three sections: cash flow from operations;
cash flow from investing activities; and cash flow from financing activities.

Since cash flow can vary widely between industries, a company's cash flow
numbers should be compared with peers in its industry group.

MarketSmith subscribers can glance at a weekly chart-data block to get a cash
flow per share figure for the latest fiscal year.

Before diving into SEC filings, though, make sure the stock checks out on the
main CAN SLIM variables. Are the current quarterly earnings up by a material
amount? What about annual earnings and sales? Is the company No. 1 or 2 in its
industry in terms of fundamental and technical strength? If not, don't waste
your time crunching cash flow numbers. Start and end with the best of the best.

Remember, the goal is to reduce your investment choices from among thousands of
stocks to just a handful -- with outstanding potential -- that are near buy
points. Then it pays to drill down deeper: Understand what the company does, how
it makes money, what its cash flow is like.

The accompanying table highlights stocks from the IBD 50 with high levels of
cash flow per share.

Paycom Software, which provides cloud-based human resources software, earns a
highest possible 99 EPS Rating. It has shown even better cash flow per share
figures. In 2014, operating cash flow per share of 31 cents topped earnings of
18 cents per share by 72%.

Paycom recently broke out from a third-stage consolidation pattern. The recent
new issue is trading a bit below the 35.96 buy point after pulling back from an
11% gain.

Skyworks Solutions' cash flow per share topped earnings by about 18% in the
latest fiscal year. Cash flow of $3.81 a share in 2014 also was up sharply from
$2.65 in 2013 and $2.14 in 2012. You want to see cash flow growing from one year
to the next. If a company is reporting earnings per share growth that is not
accompanied by healthy increases in cash flow, it could be a warning sign that
the company is not as financially strong as it appears.

The stock recently broke out past a 102.87 flat-base buy point. The Internet of
Things chipmaker is also an Apple supplier. Skyworks' EPS have grown an average
83% over the past three quarters.

World Cup 2014: Cash, There's No Substitute

LENGTH: 676 words


The three and a half million football fans heading to Brazil for the 2014 FIFA
World Cup could have a "real" problem on their hands if banks aren't prepared.
Aside from public transport and services, the region is also working overtime to
meet the financial demands of visitors, writes Micki Nguyen

As fans from around the world flock to the tournament, the demand for cash is
expected to rise, particularly in the recently developed areas hosting World Cup
activities. Making sure World Cup fans visiting from around the world can access
their cash creates a logistical challenge for banks, ATM service providers and
others in the cash supply chain.

The role of cash

Despite the global rise of mobile and other payments, cash use remains high in
Brazil. 65% of Brazilians prefer to pay with cash over other payment methods,
according to research by Boa Vista Services. In Brazil, more than half of the
population receive their salaries in cash. It's no surprise that concession and
retail vendors at the World Cup stadiums in Brazil only accept Visa, and of
course...cash. Fans traveling to the stadiums to cheer on their favourite teams
may find it hard to get around using a credit card as most small businesses and
cab drivers only speak the universally accepted payment language of cash.

The importance of cash at major events was amply demonstrated at the London 2012
Olympics where a number of ATMs were not available at Olympic venues in a push
towards creating a "cashless" event, meaning that some venues had no cash points
at all. This policy backfired, however, at Wembley Stadium when 80,000
spectators were left unable to pay by card, with just two ATMs among them.

With all eyes on the Brazil in one of the world's largest stages, cash should
not be the payment method that fails.

Coping with the event

Even with one of the largest ATM networks in the world with over 160,000 ATMs,
the tournament will put pressure on Brazil's cash supply chain and distribution
as visitors seek to stock up on cash. Banks in Brazil must intelligently
forecast and respond quickly to get cash in the hands of fans to avoid the
potential reputational risk that could come with running out of cash.

Intelligent planning, communication and collaboration were critical for the
banks in the UK to manage the unprecedented challenges of providing cash to
patrons of the 2012 Olympics in London. Brazilian banks can learn from previous
host countries of major events and develop cash management strategies to keep up
with anticipated demand.

Getting cash to customers at the right place at the right time means
collaborative cash forecasting and risk management strategies among banks and
service providers. Scheduling deliveries, for example, to take place at night
and increasing security measures is necessary to deter criminals seeking to take
advantage of predictable cash travel times. At an event where crime is a concern
for visitors and organisers alike, it is important to ensure the supply of cash
is safe and stable.

ATM connections in the region are improving but visitors will need to look for
Visa, Mastercard, Cirrus, and Maestro logos, to ensure compatibility. Visitors
to Brazil should also be extra vigilant of their surroundings and check ATM
equipment and the area around ATMs for anything unusual. The good news is that
the widespread adoption of EMV card technology (chip and pin) in Brazil should
help alleviate card fraud risk. Even if all ATMs were connected to a global
network, the arrival of so many fans for the World Cup would still put a strain
on the cash and logistics infrastructure.

Banks need to act now to proactively put cash management strategies in place
will ensure fans can easily access cash no matter when or where in Brazil. With
visitors from the around the world flocking to Brazil, banks need to re-think
their cash and device management strategies to make sure cash availability is
not an issue, particularly with the Olympics just around the corner.

Underlying value of a company is easily determined

BYLINE: Nathan Bell - Research director at Intelligent Investor,

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 747 words


Investors constantly worry about reported earnings, which is why the valuation
shortcut that derives from it - the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) - gets a great
deal of attention.

Too much attention, in fact.

Reported earnings and the underlying value of a business often don't have much
in common but many investors believe they're much the same thing.

As a result, they get into all sorts of problems with PERs.

There is a better way, called free cash flow yield.

Free cash flow is the cash a business produces, available to distribute to
shareholders, buy new businesses or pay down debt.

It's different to reported earnings, which are more easily manipulated and
surprisingly easy to calculate.

Free cash flow is key

Head to a company's statement of cash flows to establish a business's operating
cash flow - look for "net cash inflow from operating activities". Now look for
"payments for property, plant and equipment", or something similar, in the cash
flow statement.

This is what businesses must spend to regularly upgrade their assets, called
capital expenditure, or "capex" for short.

Companies play tricks with this number (Telstra excludes interest expenses, for
example) so you should review it for potential adjustments. And while payments
for intangibles, such as research and software, may not be for physical assets,
they're arguably capex, so those should be deducted as well.

Free cash flow, then, is operating cash flow minus capex.

Yes, it's really that simple. So how do you use it? There are a number of
considerations.

First, while operating cash flow can fluctuate from year to year, be wary of
very high variability in operating cash flows. If you find it, it needs
investigating.

Second, compare free cash flow to net profit over a multi-year period.

Free cash flow will often be less than net profit, particularly for growing
businesses, but again, investigate large discrepancies.

If a company is spending significantly more on capex than its depreciation
expense, you also need to understand why.

On the flipside, technology companies such as REA Group and IRESS depreciate
large start-up costs over many years but have low ongoing capex.

That means free cash flow is much higher than reported earnings, so using the
PER to value these stocks makes them appear more expensive than they really are.

Third, capex tends to be lumpy and, to some extent, discretionary. Make sure you
account for large but irregular spending requirements.

Fourth, not all capex is created equal. Developing property, such as the
supermarkets that Woolworths and Coles are building, is high-quality capex
because these stores will eventually be on-sold. JB Hi-Fi's decision to continue
rolling out stores into a declining consumer electronics market is not.

Sonic Healthcare

Let's look at Sonic Healthcare to see how to use this figure (see table).

The first line of the table shows the average, "normalised" free cash flows for
2011 and 2010.

If you divide this figure by the company's market capitalisation, you get the
free cash flow yield. For Sonic the figure is 4.9 per cent.

If you're aiming for 10 per cent returns from the stockmarket, that might not
sound attractive.

But this relatively high-quality company should be able to increase free cash
flow by at least 5 per cent a year with acquisitions, producing annual returns
above 10 per cent.

But if you compare Sonic's current 4.9 per cent free cash flow yield with its
dividend yield of 4.7 per cent, it's evident Sonic is paying out almost all of
its free cash flow as dividends. That means there is a strong chance dividends
could be cut if profits fall.

The higher the free cash flow yield is compared to the dividend yield, the more
sustainable dividends are likely to be.

So despite Sonic's relatively reliable profits, the stock is more suited to
growth investors than conservative income investors.

You can also compare the free cash flow yield to a company's earnings yield,
which is the inverse of the PER (one divided by the PER as a percentage).

While the free cash flow yield will often be lower than the earnings yield - as
in Sonic's case - if a company's earnings aren't turning up as free cash flow,
place a question mark over their quality.

Earnings might get all the attention, but it's cash that pays your dividends.

The strategy: to analyse a company's free cash flow.

Why do I need to do that? Bob Van Munster, of Tyndall Investment Management,
says a company's cash flow is the most important factor in determining how much
its shares are worth. That's because excess cash generated by the company can be
given back to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks or reinvested to
help the business grow further. For example, if Acme Ltd had $100 million of
free cash flow and was able to reinvest that to achieve a return of 12 per cent,
all other things being equal, the company would be worth another $12 million. If
a company doesn't have excess cash, its growth options are limited.

How does free cash flow differ from profit? Profits take into account all
aspects of the business; cash flow is more about the money coming in and out.
Van Munster says he calculates free cash flow as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) minus capital expenditure, changes in
working capital, tax paid and minority holdings.

Whoa you mean I have to figure out all this stuff myself? That's what the
professionals do, but Van Munster says an easier way for retail investors to get
a sense of a company's free cash flow is to look at the cash-flow statements in
a company's reports. He says there are three items in this statement operating
cash flow, cash flow relating to investment activities, and cash flow relating
to financing activities but it is the first that is the most important.

Van Munster says you want to see that the company's cash flow is increasing from
year to year. If cash flow is going down, you should ask why. He says the cash
-flow figures should also reflect the trend in the company's profits. If profit
is increasing but cash flow is falling, or if cash flow is not increasing as
fast as the stated profit, it may indicate looming problems or the company is
using provisioning to embellish its profits.

Is a small cash flow necessarily bad? It depends on the reason for it. Van
Munster says mining companies, for example, consume a lot of capital because
they have to grow their inventory when they want to grow their business, whereas
food retailers generally have a high level of free cash flow because their
suppliers provide their working capital. Companies can also have low levels of
cash flow when they are investing for the future.

Beating the festive season cash rush - NewsDay Zimbabwe

LENGTH: 1134  words


In the past three or so years, an annual trend had developed that saw banking
halls crowded with customers withdrawing their money to facilitate the annual
festive shopping extravaganza.

by Clive Mphambela

Zimbabweans had over recent years, developed a culture of carrying hard cash and
using it for all transactions, large and small. Whether one was buying a few
groceries worth $100 or paying for a car worth $10 000, there was a huge bias
towards making and receiving payments for goods in cold hard cash.

Fortunately, the banking sector has responded pretty swiftly, not only to ensure
that adequate cash holdings are available during this period of increased money
demand, but they have also put in place many alternative payment platforms,
which are available for customers to use in order to avoid queuing up in banking
halls or carrying large amounts of cash around.

Why is carrying cash around risky?

Let us remember that carrying large amounts of cash around also poses a high
personal security risk for people, as they are exposed to muggings and theft of
the cash. It is common cause that the "cash economy", as most of us now know it,
also puts pressure on banks to provide adequate notes in bank vaults so that the
banking public can have access to their money as the festive spending rises.

How can you prepare yourself adequately for the 'seasonal cash demand'?

Since the adoption of the multicurrency system in 2009, there has been a growing
demand for cash, particularly in late November through to December of each year.
This natural seasonal increase in the demand for cash is caused by the need for
increased cash holdings by economic agents to pay for various transactions. The
bonus payments at the end of the year naturally result in people having a little
bit more to spend and, therefore, they hold relatively larger cash balances in
their pockets, wallets, purses and homes. This is because the end of the year is
a natural time for that extra spending on goods and services. Some also take the
opportunity to settle those nagging long time debts and obligations. But do we
have to use cash to settle all these bills, pay for groceries or buy that dress
for a Christmas gift?

Banks, naturally, will have prepared adequately for the increased cash demand
and I am sure that a lot of cash has already been imported from thousands of
miles away to cater for the increased needs of the public. This leads us to
another important point about the use of the United States dollar in the
economy.

'Importing cash is neither free nor cheap'

Yes, this is unfortunately true! Just think about how that crisp new $100 note
ends up in your wallet, when the teller pays it to you as you make a cash
withdrawal. Every note that we have in circulation in the country has travelled
a long way to get here, but at a cost.

While some bit of the cash that we use every day comes into the country through
the borders as people travel into the country and leave their US$ here after
spending them on local goods and services, the bulk of the cash that is
circulating in the country is directly imported by the banks in Zimbabwe.

Sadly, while at face value it may seem cheap to use cash, it is in actual fact
very expensive to use cash all the time. Worse still, a lot of the cash that
banks are importing at great expense is being exported by people as they travel
to other countries to buy goods for resale locally. These imports are made
mostly in cash and as we have said above, this cash does not come back into the
country. The neighbouring countries get the cash for free after our banks have
imported it at great cost.

How we can conserve our cash?

How can the banking public assist the banks in making sure that there is enough
cash to go around during the oncoming peak season? Consumers can and should
utilise alternative payment platforms and avoid, firstly spending hours queuing
in banks and secondly carrying huge amounts of cash with them. Here are a few
tips on how we can all enjoy the festive season, whilst not facing the
unpleasant inconvenience of having to run out of cash.

Technology has advanced quite rapidly and it is high time all consumers adapt to
change, move with the times and adopt convenient ways of transacting.

l Avoid banking halls, rather withdraw cash from Automated Teller Machines
(ATMs)

Zimbabwe's banking system has put at the disposal of the banking system a wide
network of ATMs. Some banks have even gone further to introduce in-store ATMs so
that instead of going into the banking hall, simply withdraw cash from the ATM
and effect your transactions using your card if there is a point of sale (POS)
device installed within the shop.

l Use POS machines

Always use a pos machine with your ATM card whenever there is one installed in
the shop. POS charges are normally cheaper than cash withdrawal charges that
most banks levy for withdrawing cash from the bank or ATM. Most pos facilities
also have a cash-back facility, where you can get the extra cash you need in the
same transaction that you pay for goods or services. Using POS based facilities
enables you to save yourself a trip to the bank.

l Sign up for SMS and e-mail alerts

Most banks now offer SMS alert services that send you notifications whenever a
transaction happens on your account. Sign up for this platform and receive SMS
message alerts for all transactions on your account. This way you do not need to
walk into the banking hall to inquire about your balance.

l Use internet banking platforms

Instead of queuing for hours just to do a bank transfer, or to make a cash
withdrawal, sign up for internet banking services with your bank and effect your
transfers from the comfort of your home or office or on the move via your
desktop PC, laptop, tablets and iPads. Use this payment method for paying
utility bills, and even personal debts. Develop the habit of asking for your
creditor's account details and transfer the money to them, rather than going to
the bank and getting cash.

l Mobile banking platforms are quite convenient

Buy airtime, pay for goods and services and utility bills via your telephone
through mobile banking platforms available from almost all banks in Zimbabwe.
There are also a variety mobile-based transfer platforms to choose from and the
banking public is encouraged to use these convenient facilities to send or
receive money.

Discover Why a Merchant Cash Advance Might Be a Better Solution Than You Think

LENGTH: 724  words

DATELINE: Studio City, CA


Small Business Center has issued the following news release:

A merchant cash advance offers small businesses access to cash quickly and
easily. Mainstream loans are still difficult to access for small businesses,
despite mainstream lenders claiming they have become more flexible in their
qualifying terms. Since cash flow is the lifeblood of any business, small
businesses need an effective way to cover their cash flow gaps and the most
effective solution at the moment is a merchant cash advance.
What Is a Merchant Cash Advance?

A merchant cash advance is not actually classed as a loan because, essentially,
your business receives a lump sum payment in exchange for a portion of your
future credit card sales at a discount. Basically, you get a certain amount of
money and have to pay it back over a pre-agreed term as a percentage of your
monthly credit card sales.

It's actually quite similar to factoring except that instead of the business
selling all accounts receivable at a discount, the business "sells" a portion of
all credit card sales at a discount to the merchant.
The Pros and Cons of Merchant Cash Advances

The biggest attraction of merchant cash advances is that they are the safest way
to get working capital because your business doesn't have to offer up an assets
as security. Furthermore, since they aren't classed as loans, these types of
advances wont' show up on your credit report, ergo your credit rating won't be
affected.

Merchant cash advances also don't require you to jump through hoops to gain
access to the cash. Usually, only two factors will be considered, namely the
level of your credit card sales per month and how long you've been in business.
Typically, you won't need to provide tax returns, business plans or financial
statements like you would with a mainstream lender. And providers of these cash
advances are much more flexible, meaning that even if you couldn't qualify for a
mainstream loan, there's a really good chance you will be able to get a merchant
cash advance.

With a merchant cash advance, you'll also be able to gain access to the funds
quite quickly precisely because there are so few hoops to jump through. A
standard business loan can take weeks or months to go through, if it does go
through. With MCAs, you can have the money within a few days.

Repayments are calculated as a percentage of sales, which means repayments
fluctuate according to how much money you make in a certain month. This means
repayments will have a much lower impact on your cash flow because the level of
your repayment will fluctuate according to the revenues you generate. If you
generate a lower revenue one month, your repayment will decline accordingly.

However, considering the length of time it takes to get a loan or the very good
chance you might not get the loan at all, merchant cash advances are definitely
a good option.
Merchant Cash Advances Aren't Quite As Expensive as You've Been Told

The main issue with merchant cash advances is that they tend to be more
expensive than commercial loans. However, what is rarely analyzed is how much
more expensive it would be to your business if you didn't have the cash when you
needed it.

For example, a small business experiencing a cash flow gap could easily fail if
it doesn't obtain working capital quickly to keep the ball rolling. Without cash
to buy inventory to sell, for instance, it won't be long before you go out of
business. And since a merchant cash advance won't negatively impact your cash
flow - Bloomberg states that you can typically expect to pay between 8 and 10
percent of gross sales - you have a better chance of avoiding the much more
expensive situation of your business going under.

And when you consider that the cost of money with a merchant cash advance can be
spread out over as long as a year, merchant cash advances no longer seem quite
as expensive.

Clearly, a merchant cash advance is a great option for any business, especially
when you need cash urgently and would rather avoid all the hassle involved with
getting a commercial loan. When used to generate more revenues, merchant cash
advances are often a much better option than traditional business loans, even if
they seem slightly more expensive at first.

Cash Flow Shows Companies' Conditions

BYLINE: JUAN CARLOS ARANCIBIA

SECTION: Making Money; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 503 words


Cash is king, the saying goes, and for businesses it's cash flow in particular
that reigns high.

Cash flow is a breakdown of funds going into and out of a company from all its
activities. It is reported alongside the profit and loss statement and the
balance sheet.

Items such as paying employees, rent and utilities reduce operating cash flow.
Money coming in, mainly from sales, increases it.

Because they track actual dollars, cash flow figures can do a better job
reflecting current company conditions than other financials. They are also
harder to manipulate than other numbers.

For example, a company may consider a signed contract part of its revenue under
certain accounting methods.

But until the check comes in, it's not recorded on its cash flow statement.

To get the operating cash flow number, you can add back all non-cash items into
the net income, or earnings. Those items include depreciation and amortization.

Warning In Internet Boom

Cash flow statements would have told investors that the soaring initial public
offerings in the Internet boom of the late 1990 s had suspicious financials,
says an expert on financial statements.

"All those newly formed companies that went public started to report increases
in revenue and net income almost from day one," Jay Taparia, an analyst, wrote
in his book "Understanding Financial Statements."

"This made investors happy -- they thought they saw money pouring into the
business. If investors had taken a look at the cash flow statement . . . they
would have seen that all that cash was coming from other shareholders and bank
debt, not sales.

"They were funding the business through financing, which can only be done so
long. When the investment money dried up and sales still weren't there, the
bubble burst."

What To Look For

As a general rule, growth companies should have 20% more in annual operating
cash flow per share than their most recent fiscal year's earnings per share.

Let's say a company earns $2 a share. You want to see operating cash flow per
share of at least $2.40.

Still, the number can vary from one industry to the next. Some industries
generate more cash than others.

The key for a firm is to keep its operating cash flow positive and preferably
increase it from year to year.

There are two other measures of cash flow that companies disclose in their
financial reports. These are cash from investing activities and cash from
financing activities.

Cash flow from investing activities can include income a company receives from
investments it has made.

Financing activities would cover money obtained through stock or bond offerings.
Outflows could include debt repayments.

The three types make up a company's cash flow statement.

Data Sources

Cash flow can be found in a company's filings with the SEC, or often its own Web
site.

The schlock austerity of Johnny Cash

BYLINE: Jody Rosen, slate.com

SECTION: ISSUES & IDEAS; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 1451  words


These days, it's hard to find anyone who isn't a Johnny Cash fan. Three years
after his death, he's become one of those rare musicians held in near-universal
esteem. Everyone knows he's great, and his music is touched with such timeless
and ineffable cool that hipsters still love him despite his embrace by the
unhip. Cash's posthumous career, needless to say, is going very well. A best-of
CD landed in the Billboard Top 10 last year, and a new album, American V: A
Hundred Highways, arrived on July 4 and promptly hit No. 1. It's the first Cash
album to top the pop charts since Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) -- proof
positive that as much as we esteem our "living legends," we prefer them recently
dead and deified in Hollywood biopics.

The current wave of Cash-mania kicked into high gear with last year's Walk the
Line, but the real force behind the Cash revival is Rick Rubin, the rock/hip-hop
super-producer who oversaw the singer's last five studio albums. Together,
they're dubbed the American Recordings series, and A Hundred Highways is the
fifth volume. Rubin remembers a time when Cash had considerably less cachet. The
producer saw his first Cash concert in the early 1990s -- at an Orange County
dinner theatre. Cash had been dropped by Columbia Records, had made a string of
lackluster albums for Mercury and was contemplating an end to his recording
career altogether. He'd been largely abandoned by country fans -- his
relationship with the Nashville establishment was always chilly -- and the rock
audience that had discovered him through Bob Dylan in the late 1960s had
likewise moved on.

Rubin's solution was simple; in fact, his solution was simplicity. On American
Recordings (1994), Rubin stripped back the musical arrangements to a bare
minimum, setting Cash's fathoms-deep baritone against stark acoustic guitar
picking. Throw in a couple of surprising rock cover tunes, a video starring Kate
Moss and appearances at the Viper Room in L.A., and the rest was history -- up
shot the record sales and in rolled the Grammys.

In the decade following, Cash and Rubin recorded scores more songs, scarcely
altering the formula. Together, the five Cash-Rubin studio albums -- along with
Unearthed, a box-set release of outtakes from their sessions -- form one of most
satisfying groups of popular recordings of the last decade-plus. Cash had always
sung spirituals, folk songs,and country standards, but the American Recordings
series proved that, like Ray Charles and Willie Nelson, he could sing any song,
bringing depth and gravity to everything from WWII-era pop standards to Depeche
Mode's Personal Jesus.

The American Recording series also features some mesmerizing Cash originals,
songs that present an old man's awe-struck and amused meditations on death.
American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) is a virtual concept album about death,
and its churning title track, with a lyric cribbed from the Book of Revelation,
stands as one of Cash's greatest creations. The mood is even more elegiac on A
Hundred Highways, which was made in 2002 and 2003, in the months following the
death of Cash's wife June and before his own death on Sept. 12, 2003. In a
ragged, wheezy voice -- Cash suffered from asthma in the last months of his life
-- Cash sings gospel prayers, visions of resurrection and another stunning new
song, Like the 309, the last he ever wrote, in which he imagines his casket
being loaded on a train for a final ride.

And yet, for all their greatness, the Cash-Rubin records give off an
unmistakable whiff of cheese. It feels peevish to find fault in albums that
contain indelible performances by one of the 20th century's singular
troubadours. But if it's possible for music to be both great art and shameless
kitsch, look no further.

For starters, check out the album covers: a series of stark black-and-white
photos capturing the singer in mythic poses -- in a black cape on the edge of a
wind-whipped field of grain; framed by a weather-beaten wooden fence; nearly
swallowed up by shadows -- beneath the giant lettering "CASH." The critic Paul
Evans once called Sinatra's late-period albums "embarrassing
Ol'-Blue-Eyes-Is-God stuff," and a similar spirit is at work here. In a 2004 NPR
interview, Rubin confessed, "I don't know that it was so much [Cash's] music,
per se, that drew me to him. It was more his overall persona ... [he was]
rebellious, honest, divided. There was clearly a side of him that was spiritual
and religious, and there was another side of him that was dark and drug-using --
he really lived an extreme life."

In other words, Cash was an icon of authenticity, whose mixture of bad-boy
attitude and down-home piety excited a rocker dude's romantic imagination.
Rubin's vision of Cash as Ye Olde Goth is evident in the choice of repertoire --
he steered the singer toward dark, death-haunted folk songs like Mary of the
Wild Moor and covers of Danzig and Nine Inch Nails -- and in the relentlessly
monochrome musical settings. Rubin has always favored minimalism. (Even his
hip-hop records are stark.) But the fastidiously unadorned and solemn music on
the American Recordings series -- bare-bones rock ensembles playing stately
tempos, with bass piano notes tolling like church bells over minor chords --
seems designed to clobber listeners with the idea that they are in the presence
of a Great Man Singing the Truth. We usually associate kitsch in music with the
big and blowzy, but the Cash-Rubin records use the opposite musical tactic for
emotional manipulative effect. It's schlock austerity.

Not that Cash and Rubin were afraid to indulge in outright tear-jerking. From
the tremulous versions of all-time weepers like Danny Boy and First Time Ever I
Saw Your Face to Cash's spoken interludes in We'll Meet Again and the new
album's A Legend in My Time (which packs an extra My Way-style
self-mythologizing wallop), the American Recordings albums include some of the
most purple musical moments this side of Mantovani. Cash's emotional
forthrightness was a refreshing change from irony-choked popular culture. Still,
sometimes too much is too much. Many a pop balladeer has been raked over the
coals for lesser sins than Cash's corn-pone recitation of the Old West poem A
Cowboy's Lament.

The most celebrated product of the Cash-Rubin partnership was the cover of Nine
Inch Nail's Hurt, and the resulting Mark Romanek-directed video was nominated
for Video of the Year in 2003. But that video is the prime example of the
occasionally dodgy taste that surrounded the rebirth of Cash. Trent Reznor's
song was an ambiguous ballad about masochism; Cash reportedly interpreted it as
a drug-addict's confession. But the Romanek video turns the song into ghoulish
hagiography, interspersing file footage from Cash's younger years with lingering
shots of the present-day singer, looking very old and unwell -- an unseemly mix
of reverence (Johnny is God) and exploitation (Johnny's Gonna Die Soon).

The problem with all this Cash-worship is that it's reductive. Cash had a long
and varied career as an entertainer. Sure, he specialized in gothic country
songs and murder ballads, and yes, he had a drug problem, wrecked some hotel
rooms and did other "rebellious" things. But he also recorded albums of
children's music and clowned around with the Monkees on The Johnny Cash Show, a
tacky ABC variety program he hosted for two years. Rubin clearly cherishes the
image of Cash as an anti-establishment renegade. When Cash won the best country
album Grammy for Unchained, Rubin took out an ad in Billboard featuring a famous
photo of Cash flipping the bird to the camera above the inscription, "American
Recordings and Johnny Cash would like to acknowledge the Nashville music
establishment and country radio for your support." But the truth is, Cash was as
steeped in show business as any Nashville hack -- his "Man in Black" wardrobe
was a uniform just like Tim McGraw's 10 gallon Stetson, and the grizzled,
wounded voice you hear on the American Recordings albums was just one of many
registers in which he could sing.

One of the more revealing recordings of the Cash-Rubin collaboration is the
gospel-tinged If I Give My Soul, on Unearthed. According to Rubin, Cash began
singing the song in a broad, stagy style. (He had just come off a concert tour.)
Rubin interrupted Cash; he wanted a more intimate performance. The Unearthed
version begins at this point: The singer intones, "Get off-stage, Cash" and
drops into his quiet, reflective, "soul-baring" mode. That moment reminds you
what Johnny Cash was, on his first Sun Records recordings in 1955, during the
final Rubin sessions just weeks prior to his death and all those decades in
between: a pro.

Cash flow, and ways

to avoid selling your car

"I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today."

- Wimpy from the "Popeye" comic

WIMPY WAS USING credit before credit cards were around.

Cash flow represents the movement of money into and out of your business. The
sources can be from operations, investments and financing. This is often
considered the most important metric, because a business without cash is simply
out of business!

There are only two ways to improve cash flow: more inflow and less outflow. Cash
flow analysis (projections) can be used to determine the amount of start-up
capital needed for a new business. Compute monthly, at a minimum, until positive
cash flow is achieved.

There is often confusion about cash flow projections and budgeting; they are not
the same thing.

A budget emphasizes what you expect to spend over a specific period of time
(usually one year). Cash flow emphasizes when you expect to spend the money and
is a real-world number.

A budget can be compared to a traffic light with clear signals such as stop,
caution and go. A budget doesn't represent real-world numbers (only estimates)
of what is expected to happen. Cash flow, however, is like a stop sign: You have
to decide when to go, based on traffic, and the traffic is always changing.

Run the stop sign and the results can be catastrophic. Let's examine cash flow
in more detail.

Cash in -- Any money that comes into the business checking account, whether
derived from cash received, accounts receivable collected, advances from a
credit line, borrowed money (a loan), equity or owner invested funds into the
business.

Cash out -- All business expenses paid out, including payroll, draws by owner,
etc...

Change in cash position -- Essentially, your checking account at month's end,
adding inflows and subtracting outflows to get an ending balance. This amount
becomes your beginning balance for the following month.

It may be helpful to classify entries with labels such as cash from operations
(either from sales or accounts receivable); and cash from equity, bank or other
loans, or owner investments. This enables you to more easily track changes in
different categories and make adjustments.

If you are fortunate enough to have a "cash-rich" business, as few do, then you
have several options: You could pay down debt (if any), you could invest a
portion of the excess cash and earn interest on these funds, you could pre-pay
invoices requesting greater discounts from vendors, you could give employees
raises, or maybe you could take more for yourself. How about a 401K plan?

If cash is tight in your business and you are experiencing a "cash crunch," you
may want to do a cash-flow analysis more frequently, perhaps weekly.

Improving cash flow

So how can you improve your cash flow? Here are 22 ways.

1. Sell more products or services. One of my favorite sayings is, "Sales cure
all problems." This assumes that your margins are sufficient.

2. Be cautious when extending credit.

3. Accelerate accounts-receivable collections. Get on the phone, if necessary.

4. Charge interest for late payments.

5. Seek up-front payments or deposits, if possible.

6. Accept credit cards to get paid sooner.

7. Take vendor discounts if your cash flow is strong.

8. Delay payments to creditors or align payments with receipts.

9. Negotiate favorable payment terms, such as 60 or 90 days or more.

10. Use alternate financing, such as factoring receivables.

11. Lease equipment instead of purchasing.

12. Establish and use credit lines from financial institutions.

13. Finance purchases.

14. Arrange private loans.

15. Sell an equitable interest in your business.

16. Optimize inventory levels. Use JIT (just in time) where possible.

17. Operate more efficiently.

18. Acquire goods less expensively.

19.S ell assets.

20. Cut workers' hours.

21. Outsource select business activities requiring less cash.

22. Get your billings out promptly.

Many years ago, I remember having to sell my Mercedes Benz to make payroll.
Fortunately, I owned the car and was able to get $17,000. I then leased a new
car. Can you guess what happened? My employees saw that I had a new car and all
wanted raises. Of course they had no clue what happened!

It is critical to know your cash position now as well as projections into the
future. Develop a strategy to meet your short-term and long-term cash needs. For
example, what will you do when business slows down? If you have a seasonal
business, have you prepared for the lean months? Timing is critical to cash
flow.

Whatever you do, do not run out of cash. Cash may be king, but cash flow is the
queen. If you play chess and you lose your queen, it is usually game over.

Rosslare Introduces Its Unique Cash Van Access Control Solution

LENGTH: 633  words


Wednesday, April 09, 2014: Rosslare Security, a worldwide provider of
professional Access Control and Intrusion solutions, introduces its cash van
access control solution to secure cash transportation.

According to industry estimates, the total volume of banknotes in circulation
worldwide rises by around three percent each year, so almost every country is
facing an increased demand for banknote processing. India is a developing
country and every day new ATMs are opened, increasing the demand for cash
transportation many fold. Cash Transportation companies have also increased
their number of cash vans to fulfill the demand from the market. However,
security is still a daily concern for these cash vans and investing in security
guards for these cash vans are costly for cash van companies.

Considering the security concerns and a huge demand from cash van companies for
electronically securing their cash vans, Rosslare has introduced its unique and
secure Cash Van Access Control Solution. After extensive research and talking
with multiple cash van companies for their requirement, Rosslare has designed
its Cash Van Access Control Solution while knowing that cash vans and vault
areas must have restricted and controlled access. All doors must be controlled,
one door only can be opened at a time, and the main cash door can only be opened
with dual authentication by driver and security guard. One supervisor should
have overall control, including the driver cabin, and a security guard must be
inside the van at all times.

Rosslare's unique Cash Van Access Control Solution offers a 5-door interlocking
management system, driver cabin control, cash in and cash out management, and
vehicle maintenance as well. The following describes the components of
Rosslare's Cash Van Access Control Solution, which is considered one of the best
available in the market:

* A 5-door management control (one reader for two doors and two readers for
three doors)

* A 4-reader controller (AC-425) with an onboard door expander (MD-D04) to
control all 8 readers

* The Supervisor has driver cabin control, with the only card that opens the
driver cabin

* A 5-door interlocking system is used so that only one door can be opened at a
time

* A long-range reader (AY-Z12A) installed at the dashboard enables opening the
driver's gate from outside the van

* The main door is controlled by an AC-020 standalone controller connected to an
AY-Q12 anti-vandal reader

* All gates can be opened with a single authentication and closed with the next
single authentication

* Using AxTraxNG software, an Output Group is created and assigned to a specific
card using the AC Link option

"Cash transportation especially in India is getting considered as a very
sensitive issue and getting managed very professionally by different cash van
companies. New ATMs coming every day and lots of rural areas are getting
covered. Cash transportation to those rural areas needs to have a very strong
security system. Security using security guards are not always considered that
secure and can be overpowered any time. There comes the requirement of a
foolproof electronic security system that cannot be overpowered, and there
should not be a compromise with such a sensitive issue of carrying cash. Our
Cash Van Access Control System has been designed while keeping most of the
aspect of cash transportation in mind, and offers a foolproof system and a peace
of mind to companies in cash van business and banks as well. Banks are also
choosing only those cash van companies whose vans are equipped with electronic
security systems. We have already implemented our solution for one of the
biggest cash van service providers in India and more than 50 vans are
operational and working with our solution" says Manmohan Kumar, Sales Director
India.

Stay afloat navigating cash flow

BYLINE: Rene Blaszak

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 80

LENGTH: 565  words


FOR the past six months there has been a lot of news about large and small
companies collapsing and going out of business.

Why is this so?

The answer is usually painfully simple -- the owners had run out of cash needed
to pay bills when credit was no longer acceptable.

The underlying problem with small business is lack of effective cash management
to ensure cash pitfalls are predictable and avoided.

Enter the cash flow statement.

Let's assume, for simplicity's sake, we are going to look at our business's cash
situation once a month. We can use a simple spreadsheet tool, such as Excel, but
if you can't, you can do this easily by hand with a piece of paper and a pocket
calculator. But remember to update regularly so that it contains current
numbers.

First, set up a table with 14 columns.

The first column's title is ``Item'', the next 12 columns are the months of the
financial year July/August/September etc with the last one is headed ``totals''.

For more accuracy you can divide each of the monthly columns vertically into two
so you can head them ``Actual'' and ``Budget'' respectively for each month.

This is because in the budget columns you are going to insert your best guesses
what each cash item is likely to be. You will put in your ``actuals'' as they
occur.

In the extreme left hand column headed ``Item'' you will write down your monthly
opening balance derived directly from your business's bank account. This tells
you exactly how much cash you have in the bank on the first day of each month.

Then staying in that Item column start listing all your sources of cash, one by
one, noting the sources of each revenue stream such as retail sales or revenue
from service calls.

You can then put in a ``Total'' after your last source of cash to provide your
total cash inflow.

Next add another phrase in your Item column called ` Cash Availability'' which,
of course, is the sum of your ``Opening Balance'' above plus your ``Total cash
inflow''.

This is extremely important because it tells you just how much cash you have to
`play' with.

Now let's start listing all our cash expenses item by item until we can list all
total cash expenses which when compared against cash availability will hopefully
provide a cash surplus.

This last figure must line up with your bank balance at the end of the month and
also becomes your opening balance for the next month.

You then fill in your actuals for each month as the year progresses and if you
were able at the start of the year to put in your budget figures for each month,
you can gauge how well your cash management skills are against what you
expected.

You have now prepared your very own cash flow statement and monetary road
directory.

There is one important point to follow, however. Every figure you put into you
table must be cash. Credit, uncleared cheques and promissory notes have no place
in your cash flow statement.

For example, if you pay any bills by credit card, the related cash component
only hits your spreadsheet/table on the day you pay cash to settle your credit
card bill -- usually the next month after you ``paid'' by credit card.

WITH A BUSINESS' CASH FLOW, TIMING IS EVERYTHING

BYLINE: LESLIE HOFFMAN

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. D-3

LENGTH: 664 words


Ever had a friend who seemed to have it all -- high-paying job, nice car,
beautiful home and plenty of toys to fill the garage? But at the end of the
month, your successful friend doesn't seem to have $10 to his name. Turns out he
has been pouring all those earnings into the house, the car and the toys.
Perhaps he can afford them all, but he could certainly use a lesson in cash-flow
management.

This illustrates a critical lesson for business owners: Profitable companies can
go bankrupt. It may seem counterintuitive -- a business that lands in the black
can simultaneously be putting itself out of business. But business owners who
fail to manage cash flow can find themselves much like that friend -- with
positive earnings but no cash to pay bills.

The first step is to create a cash budget -- a powerful financial tool that
helps you monitor and manage cash inflows and outflows, plan for excesses and
deficiencies of cash, and decide when you need to borrow and when you can pay
back loans. Having a better handle on the collection and payment of cash can
forestall the kind of cash crises that plague many small businesses and can lead
to bankruptcy, even if the business is profitable.

While it is important to budget for sales, it is critical to budget for cash
collections -- when you will be paid for the goods and services you provide.
Equally important is to budget for cash payments -- when your vendors or
suppliers are required to be paid. Timing is the key: Unless you operate a cash
-only business, sales do not equal cash collections, and expenses do not equal
cash payments. Many businesses extend credit and, thus, are paid sometime after
the sale is made. Likewise, many businesses pay vendors after the goods or
services have been received.

A cash budget can be created by adding all of your expected cash inflows to your
bank balance at the beginning of the month, then subtracting expected cash
outflows to determine how much cash will remain at month's end.

For example, let's say your company has been earning a profit, and thanks to
strong recent sales, is on target to exceed last month's income. You project
$22,000 in sales this month and you started the month with $4,000 cash in the
bank.

Based on historical trends, you project that of the $22,000 in sales, you will
only receive $12,000 since $10,000 of it will be sold on credit. You also expect
to collect $3,000 the business is still owed from last month's sales. Based on
this, you expect your cash receipts -- everything that represents an inflow of
cash -- to be $15,000.

During the month you must pay $12,000 for the purchase of new inventory and
$8,000 for wages. These cash disbursements -- everything that represents a cash
payment -- amount to $20,000.

Given this scenario, your business would actually be running a cash deficit of
$1,000 and you will need to scramble to find cash to pay bills. Remember that
this is the same business that is earning a net profit before taxes of $3,000 on
sales of $23,000 less expenses of $20,000.

If you already have an accountant, you should sit down with her or him to talk
about building a set of budgeted financial statements. If you're just getting
started and want to learn more about the basics of cash flow, there are a number
of small business development resources out there ready to help. Organizations
that offer classes and workshops include the Small Business Development Center
Network www.nmsbdc.org, WESST Corp (www.wesst.org) and SCORE (www.score.org).

The Guide: Cash upfront: Walk The Line draws a poignant portrait of Johnny
Cash's rise to stardom, but the music legend saved his finest work for his last
years. Bring on the sequel, says Andrew Mueller

BYLINE: Andrew Mueller

SECTION: THE GUIDE; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 1250 words


Walk The Line, James Mangold's cinematic telling of the early life of Johnny
Cash, takes its title from one of its subject's best-known songs. I Walk The
Line, released in 1956, was Cash's third single, intended as a pledge of
fidelity to his first wife, Vivian Liberto. It is an exemplar of Cash's artistic
essence (minimal boom-chicka-boom arrangement, suggestive of a rolling train,
gently growled vocal, like a wolf making friends), and a gorgeously economical
devotional: "Because you're mine," Cash reassures the uncertain object of his
affections, "I walk the line."

Doubtless Cash's intentions were honourable when he wrote the song, but as Walk
The Line demonstrates, he spent the period of his life chronicled by the film -
his childhood in the Arkansas cottonfields, via his service in the US air force,
to his ascent to superstardom in the 1950s and 1960s - doing everything but
fulfilling its promise. Walk The Line, based substantially on Cash's frank
autobiographies, Man In Black and Cash, depicts him as drunk, drug-addled,
faithless and tormented, saved from himself only by his anguished, suppressed
and eventually requited love for the singer June Carter.

Joaquin Phoenix does superbly as Cash, capturing the singer's swagger, and
bringing an understated but unmistakable edge to the scenes dealing with Cash's
guilt over the loss of his own older brother. Reese Witherspoon is a radiant
June Carter. However, Walk The Line ends in 1968, when Cash had married Carter,
after proposing onstage, and is preparing for his legendary concert at
California's Folsom Prison - inspiration for his second single, 1955's Folsom
Prison Blues, it of the untrumpably nihilistic couplet "I shot a man in
Reno/Just to watch him die."

Cash's story up to that point is worth telling. This period helped define the
musical and spiritual parameters within which both country and rock have
subsequently operated. However, it's hard not to think that there might have
been an argument for starting with the twilight of his life - which ended in
2003, Cash succumbing to various illnesses at 71, four months after June Carter
died following heart surgery. Johnny Cash, possibly uniquely in the annals of
popular music, saved his best till last.

When contemplating the monumental accomplishment of Cash's last 10 years of life
- four albums (American Recordings, Unchained, Solitary Man, The Man Comes
Around) and a posthumous box set of extra material (Unearthed) - it is
terrifying to reflect that, had it been left to Cash, none of this astonishing
music would have been made. By the mid-1980s, Cash was a washed-up nostalgia
turn, bashing out I Walk The Line 300 nights a year to people largely
uninterested in anything he might have written in the intervening three decades.
As a recording artist, Cash had given up, and the record industry had given up
on Cash: CBS dropped him in 1986. He wrote in Cash, "I got tired of hearing
about demographics, the 'new country fan', the 'new market profile' and all the
other trends supposedly working against me. . . the last record I gave CBS was
called Chicken In Black, and it was intentionally atrocious." Cash seemed
resigned to a dotage on the cabaret circuit.

His unlikely resurrection began with an invitation from U2 to sing The Wanderer,
the weird, beautiful Louvin Brothers-meets-Kraftwerk shuffle that closed U2's
1993 album Zooropa. Though Cash had always straddled country and rock, he was a
country singer first - country music is songs of experience, as opposed to
rock's essential innocence, which is why country singers sound better as they
get older, and rock singers get shrill and ridiculous. Cash had been a
commercial and critical irrelevance for years, but he'd never sung anything
better than he did The Wanderer, his voice as solemn and portentous as a church
bell.

At around the same time, Def American label boss Rick Rubin - whose reputation
was rooted in hip-hop and metal, with production credits including Run DMC,
Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Cult - went to see
Cash hack out his hits at a dinner theatre. Rubin effected an introduction and
informed Cash that he wanted to sign him and produce him. Cash's faith in his
own potential had ebbed so far that his response, as he recalled in an interview
for the liner notes of Unearthed, was "What for?"

Rubin's idea was simple, and brilliant. He wanted to make records which
emphasised Cash's voice. He wanted the voice to sing old songs and new songs,
and he wanted to goad Cash into writing. Over the next decade, Cash and Rubin
recorded hundreds of songs, most of them set to crystalline acoustic guitars,
Cash's voice mixed so far forward it felt like it was whispering even when it
roared. Granted that at this point in Cash's life, that unmistakable drawl could
have lent mournful gravitas to Hi Ho Silver Lining, but he and Rubin deployed it
astutely, tipping a hat to country standards (Hank Williams' I'm So Lonesome I
Could Cry, Geoff Mack's I've Been Everywhere, the traditionals Sam Hall and
Streets Of Laredo) and plumbing undiscovered depths in songs by an audaciously
diverse range of rock artists, including Nick Cave (The Mercy Seat), Neil
Diamond (Solitary Man), Soundgarden (Rusty Cage), U2 (One), Depeche Mode
(Personal Jesus) and the Eagles (Desperado, a version so wrenchingly affecting
that it makes up for everything else the Eagles did). Rubin had cast Cash as the
supreme oracle of American music, the all-seeing eye at the top of the pyramid,
and the old man rose to the challenge, even as his health deserted him.

The sessions also jolted Cash's long-dormant songwriting muse awake. The
instincts that had characterised his best work in the 1950s and 60s were fizzing
again. The bleak, compellingly reductive view of death that had informed Folsom
Prison Blues was exhumed for the ballad Delia's Gone. The playful wit that had
sparked Five Feet High & Rising twinkled on Tear-Stained Letter. The title track
of The Man Comes Around was a glorious hallucination of apocalypse phrased in
language lifted from the books of Job and Revelations, a desperate bid by Cash
to prepare for his imminent introduction to his maker. It's shockingly powerful.

Most rock music is freighted with a certain idiot refusal to acknowledge such
tiresome realities as time and ageing and death - which is, of course, a major
part of its appeal. The achievement of the last years of Cash was to be honest
enough with himself and secure enough in his faith to match the Reaper's stare,
to sing and write like he knew the clock was ticking. It's all there in Mark
Romanek's magnificent video for Cash's version of Nine Inch Nails' Hurt. Filmed
in Cash's home, and in the abandoned, ruined House of Cash museum in Nashville,
it shows the greying, dying icon, parked amid the detritus of his extraordinary
life, wondering "What have I become?" while an adoring, careworn June Carter
looks on.

The clip is cut with archive footage of Cash taken from the years chronicled by
Walk The Line, and the contrast is all but unbearable: even when he was existing
on a diet of speed and alcohol, Cash was the coolest-looking man who ever lived,
as well as the coolest-sounding. These are certainly things worth celebrating,
but anyone prompted by this fine film to investigate the man's music should
start at the other end of his life, then urge James Mangold to chivvy Phoenix
and Witherspoon into makeup, and get working on a sequel.

Walk The Line is out on Friday

Business Sense: Dude, where's my money?

BYLINE: Colleen Trask/For the Times-Standard

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 1062 words


One of the first things any sensible business owner with a cash flow problem
does is print out an income statement and look at the bottom line. If the bank
account is in the red, but the bottom line shows that the business made a
profit, the very next words will be, "Well, where did my money go?"

Translating profit into cash can be a real problem for small businesses
everywhere. Just because your sales revenue exceeds your expenses for a given
month does not automatically mean that those dollars have made it into your
business bank account! So to answer that question we proudly present: the cash
flow statement.

The cash flow statement comes in two flavors: direct or indirect. The direct
version is like your bank statement. It lists the cash that has come into your
business (cash receipts), and the cash that has gone out of your business (cash
disbursements). Most of us pay close attention to our deposits, checks, and bank
balances, so the direct cash flow statement doesn't seem to be a particularly
useful report. We already know that what has been put into the bank is not
enough to cover what is going out!

The real question is: "Why isn't there enough cash for me to pay my bills on
time?" The indirect form of the cash flow statement can help us answer these
questions, but it is sometimes baffling to look at and not very intuitive to
understand. It starts reassuringly with the bottom-line number from your income
statement, and ends with the balance in your business bank account, but
everything in between those two numbers is confusing!

For starters, the statement of cash flow is divided into three alarming-sounding
sections: operating activities, investment activities, and financing activities.
Don't be intimidated: this is just fancy talk for what you do in your business.
"Operating activities" means your normal business operations -- the stuff that
shows up on your income statement. "Investing activities" is the official
description for your business investing in new equipment (or selling old
equipment). It also includes the normal things we think of as investing, like
buying a few shares of stock in your cousin's start-up venture. "Financing
activities" includes things like getting a loan from a friendly local bank or
selling shares of your company's stock to Uncle Fred (if your business is
incorporated, and Fred is trying to be supportive).

The odd vocabulary is difficult. But what's really tough about reading cash flow
statements is the fact that everything seems backward. An increase in your
accounts receivable is listed as a negative number. But it's an asset, and
assets are good, right? So why is it negative? Because it represents cash you
have not received yet. Assets may be good, but assets that have not yet turned
into cash will not help you make payroll. The same applies to inventory -- if
you have purchased inventory but not sold it yet, it may be a great asset, but
it is not helping your cash situation.

On the other hand, an increase in the balance on your company credit card, your
line of credit or your accounts payable shows up as a positive number. How
confusing! Debt is bad, right? Then why is it a positive number? Because it
represents cash you have not had to pay out yet. Remember, this is all from the
standpoint of cash, not profit. Cash you have not paid out yet is cash you might
use somewhere else if the emergency arises.

Things you have already paid for also show up as positive numbers in your cash
flow statement. The cash has already been paid out, but the expense doesn't show
up until later. Depreciation is the expense associated with equipment you have
already paid for. Prepaid rent or prepaid liability insurance would also appear
this way. These are expenses that impact your bottom line profit for a given
month, but they do not represent cash that was paid out in that month, and they
appear as positive from a cash standpoint.

So how do all these confusing numbers help you figure out where your money went?
First of all, look at the sections: operations, investment, and financing. The
sections with negative cash flow tell you exactly how what happens in your
business affects your cash.

If cash flow from operations is positive, but lots of cash went out to buy new
equipment (investing section), you might want to find a way to finance the
equipment over the same period of time it will be producing income for you --
rather than spending cash you need for payroll on machinery. Likewise, if the
negative cash flow is in the investment section, look at those numbers. Paying
down debt is good, but not when it takes all the cash you need to pay your
suppliers. Investing in your cousin's start-up is also good, but not when it
starves your business of the cash you need to survive.

If operations cash flow is negative, it's time to make some changes in your
operations, and the cash flow statement will help you pinpoint where the problem
areas are. If accounts receivable is the big negative number, look at how your
collections are being done. Who is doing them? Who is following up? A little tip
on improving collections: persistence pays and so does friendliness.

If inventory is the large negative number in your operations section, you may
want to look at how you pay for the goods you sell. If you must pay for them "up
front," but don't sell them immediately, you may want to make that up-front
payment with a line of credit or a business credit card. As soon as you sell the
inventory, immediately pay back the credit card or the line. Business credit is
a tool and this is a good way to use it to smooth out your cash flow.

In the worst-case scenario, negative numbers all over your operations section
may mean taking a hard look at how you are doing business overall and require
some hard decisions. The point is to make those decisions before the situation
is a disaster, which means asking your bookkeeper to print out your cash flow
statement on a regular basis.

Entrepreneurs are courageous people by nature, so don't let the confusing
numbers or unfamiliar words of the cash flow statement intimidate you into
ignoring a useful tool for your business. Ask your accountant or bookkeeper, or
come to the SBDC for some one-on-one business advice on how to get the most out
of your cash flow statement.

Why cash is a (slowly) dying currency

BYLINE: ROSS GITTINS

SECTION: NEWS; Opinion; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 837 words


The banks are facing some resistance as they herd us towards a cashless society.

Slowly, slowly - so slowly nobody notices - the banks are herding us towards
their nirvana of the fabled cashless economy. But cash is a long time dying, and
likely to linger for a long time yet.

In a world without cash, payment is made by using electronic means merely to
change the numbers on people's bank statements.

Why do the banks prefer this? Because it's a less expensive way to shift value
between people. In many circumstances, handling physical cash can be cumbersome,
risky and inconvenient.

Surprisingly, we have no figures for the number and value of cash transactions,
though we have excellent data for non-cash transactions. So a bit of surmise and
detective work is required.

The position seems to be that while there's been no decline in the value of cash
transactions - the value of notes and coins in circulation grows in line with
the economy's growth - the value of non-cash transactions is growing faster. So
cash is slowly losing market share, so to speak.

Leaving aside the black economy, these days few employees are paid in cash
rather than by direct credit to their bank accounts. So whereas in the old days
people had to choose to deposit some of their cash into their bank account,
these days all our income starts out in our account and we decide how much to
withdraw in cash.

I think we're less inclined to take cash out of our accounts to pay regular
bills. We're more inclined to pay them by internet or telephone Bpay or to
authorise the biller to pay himself from our account on the due date.

And when it comes to big purchases in shops, I think we're less inclined to pay
cash and more inclined to use plastic.

But we still use cash for small transactions - tram fares, buying a paper,
purchases from small shopkeepers, or children's pocket money. Why? Because it's
still the most convenient.

According to a survey conducted by the Australian Retailers Association in 2001,
cash accounts for only about 40 per cent of the value of all payments received
by the surveyed retailers.

But the proportion varied from 56 per cent cash for food and convenience stores
to 13 per cent for department stores and 9 per cent for women's clothing stores.

Meanwhile, the banks have made much progress in cutting their costs by changing
the way we withdraw cash from our accounts. In the old days we did it manually
over the branch counter. These days we're much more likely to do it using
plastic and electronics.

A survey by Roy Morgan Research in 1998 showed that pretty much the same
proportion of people used an ATM in the previous four weeks as visited a bank
branch. By last year, the proportion of people using an ATM had risen almost to
three-quarters, while the proportion visiting a branch fell to half.

It thus seems likely that most of the cash we withdraw these days comes via
new-fangled means. There are three ways: taking money out of an ATM, getting a "
cash out" from a store using Eftpos, or using your credit card to get a cash
advance.

This month's Reserve Bank Bulletin includes an article giving the split-up of
cash withdrawals between those three ways during the year to March. It carried a
few surprises.

Of the $143 billion in withdrawals, more than 85 per cent was via ATMs. So
that's the main way we get hold of cash these days. Over the past five years,
ATM withdrawals have been growing at the rate of almost 13 per cent a year.

But get this: not much less than half of all ATM withdrawals are made from
"foreign" ATMs - ones not owned by your bank. This matters because the banks
charge a fee of $1.50 for using a foreign automatic teller, whereas they charge
only about 60 cents for using one of theirs.

When people use their own bank's ATMs, their average withdrawal is almost $200;
when they use a foreign ATM, it's only $140.

You may think a lot of people get cash outs. Actually, only about a quarter of
those using their debit cards do. And, on average, they take less than $60. So
Eftpos cash outs account for only 7 per cent of the total value of electronic
cash withdrawals.

Remarkably, this means the value of the cash advances people get using their
credit cards actually exceeds the value of cash outs. And the average cash
advance is almost $300.

Of all the mainstream ways of borrowing, credit cards have the highest interest
rates. What silly, silly sausages.

The two factors driving our drift away from cash are the carefully crafted
structure of the banks' transaction fees (for instance, a branch withdrawal
costs $2.50, whereas an ATM withdrawal costs 60 cents) and our convenience.

The banks have had great success in changing the way we pay for things because,
for the most part, the way they want us to go happens also to be more convenient
for us.

But until they can come up with some more convenient way of making sundry small
retail payments, they won't rid themselves of the costly annoyance of handling
our notes and coins.

How Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin rose above the corn: A shrewd producer drives the
country icon's posthumous success

BYLINE: Jody Rosen, Slate.com

SECTION: ARTS; Pg. E1

LENGTH: 1454  words


These days, it's hard to find anyone who isn't a Johnny Cash fan. Three years
after his death, he's become one of those rare musicians held in near-universal
esteem. Everyone knows he's great, and his music is touched with such timeless
and ineffable cool that hipsters still love him despite his embrace by the
unhip. Cash's posthumous career, needless to say, is going very well. A best-of
CD landed in the Billboard Top 10 last year, and a new album, American V: A
Hundred Highways, arrived on July 4 and promptly hit No. 1. It's the first Cash
album to top the pop charts since Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) -- proof
positive that as much as we esteem our "living legends," we prefer them recently
dead and deified in Hollywood biopics.

The current wave of Cash-mania kicked into high gear with last year's Walk the
Line, but the real force behind the Cash revival is Rick Rubin, the rock/hip-hop
super-producer who oversaw the singer's last five studio albums. Together,
they're dubbed the American Recordings series, and A Hundred Highways is the
fifth volume. Rubin remembers a time when Cash had considerably less cachet. The
producer saw his first Cash concert in the early 1990s-at an Orange County
dinner theatre. Cash had been dropped by Columbia Records, had made a string of
lacklustre albums for Mercury, and was contemplating an end to his recording
career altogether. He'd been largely abandoned by country fans -- his
relationship with the Nashville establishment was always chilly -- and the rock
audience that had discovered him through Bob Dylan in the late '60s had likewise
moved on.

Rubin's solution was simple; in fact, his solution was simplicity. On American
Recordings (1994), Rubin stripped back the musical arrangements to a bare
minimum, setting Cash's fathoms-deep baritone against stark acoustic guitar
picking. Throw in a couple of surprising rock cover tunes, a video starring Kate
Moss, and appearances at the Viper Room in L.A., and the rest was history -- up
shot the record sales and in rolled the Grammys. Click Here!

In the decade following, Cash and Rubin recorded scores more songs, scarcely
altering the formula. Together, the five Cash-Rubin studio albums -- along with
Unearthed, a box-set release of outtakes from their sessions-form one of most
satisfying groups of popular recordings of the last decade-plus. Cash had always
sung spirituals, folk songs, and country standards, but the American Recordings
series proved that, like Ray Charles and Willie Nelson, he could sing any song,
bringing depth and gravity to everything from Second World War-era pop standards
to Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus.

The American Recording series also features some mesmerizing Cash originals,
songs that present an old man's awe-struck and amused meditations on death.
American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) is a virtual concept album about death,
and its churning title track, with a lyric cribbed from the Book of Revelation,
stands as one of Cash's greatest creations. The mood is even more elegiac on A
Hundred Highways, which was made in 2002 and 2003, in the months following the
death of Cash's wife June and before his own death on Sept. 12, 2003. In a
ragged, wheezy voice -- Cash suffered from asthma in the last months of his life
-- Cash sings gospel prayers, visions of resurrection, and another stunning new
song, Like the 309, the last he ever wrote, in which he imagines his casket
being loaded on a train for a final ride.

And yet, for all their greatness, the Cash-Rubin records give off an
unmistakable whiff of cheese. It feels peevish to find fault in albums that
contain indelible performances by one of the 20th century's singular
troubadours. But if it's possible for music to be both great art and shameless
kitsch, look no further.

For starters, check out the album covers: a series of stark black-and-white
photos capturing the singer in mythic poses -- in a black cape on the edge of a
wind-whipped field of grain; framed by a weather-beaten wooden fence; nearly
swallowed up by shadows-beneath the giant lettering "CASH."

The critic Paul Evans once called Sinatra's late-period albums "embarrassing
Ol'-Blue-Eyes-Is-God stuff," and a similar spirit is at work here. In a 2004 NPR
interview, Rubin confessed, "I don't know that it was so much [Cash's] music,
per se, that drew me to him. It was more his overall persona -- [he was]
rebellious, honest, divided. There was clearly a side of him that was spiritual
and religious, and there was another side of him that was dark and drug-using --
he really lived an extreme life."

In other words, Cash was an icon of authenticity, whose mixture of bad-boy
attitude and down-home piety excited a rocker dude's romantic imagination.
Rubin's vision of Cash as Ye Olde Goth is evident in the choice of repertoire --
he steered the singer toward dark, death-haunted folk songs like Mary of the
Wild Moor and covers of Danzig and Nine Inch Nail -- and in the relentlessly
monochrome musical settings. Rubin has always favoured minimalism. (Even his
hip-hop records are stark.) But the fastidiously unadorned and solemn music on
the American Recordings series -- bare-bones rock ensembles playing stately
tempos, with bass piano notes tolling like church bells over minor chords --
seems designed to clobber listeners with the idea that they are in the presence
of a Great Man Singing the Truth. We usually associate kitsch in music with the
big and blowzy, but the Cash-Rubin records use the opposite musical tactic for
emotional manipulative effect. It's shlock austerity.

Not that Cash and Rubin were afraid to indulge in outright tear-jerking. From
the tremulous versions of all-time weepers like Danny Boy and First Time Ever I
Saw Your Face to Cash's spoken interludes in We'll Meet Again and the new
album's A Legend in My Time (which packs an extra My Way-style
self-mythologizing wallop), the American Recordings albums include some of the
most purple musical moments this side of Mantovani. Cash's emotional
forthrightness was a refreshing change from irony-choked popular culture. Still,
sometimes too much is too much. Many a pop balladeer has been raked over the
coals for lesser sins than Cash's corn-pone recitation of the Old West poem A
Cowboy's Lament.

The most celebrated product of the Cash-Rubin partnership was the cover of Nine
Inch Nail's Hurt, and the resulting Mark Romanek-directed video was nominated
for Video of the Year in 2003.

But that video is the prime example of the occasionally dodgy taste that
surrounded the rebirth of Cash. Trent Reznor's song was an ambiguous ballad
about masochism; Cash reportedly interpreted it as a drug-addict's confession.
But the Romanek video turns the song into ghoulish hagiography, interspersing
file footage from Cash's younger years with lingering shots of the present-day
singer, looking very old and unwell -- an unseemly mix of reverence (Johnny is
God) and exploitation (Johnny's Gonna Die Soon).

The problem with all this Cash-worship is that it's reductive. Cash had a long
and varied career as an entertainer. Sure, he specialized in gothic country
songs and murder ballads, and yes, he had a drug problem, wrecked some hotel
rooms, and did other "rebellious" things. But he also recorded albums of
children's music and clowned around with the Monkees on The Johnny Cash Show, a
tacky ABC variety program he hosted for two years. Rubin clearly cherishes the
image of Cash as an anti-establishment renegade. When Cash won the best country
album Grammy for Unchained, Rubin took out an ad in Billboard featuring a famous
photo of Cash flipping the bird to the camera above the inscription "American
Recordings and Johnny Cash would like to acknowledge the Nashville music
establishment and country radio for your support." But the truth is, Cash was as
steeped in show business as any Nashville hack -- his "Man in Black" wardrobe
was a uniform just like Tim McGraw's 10--gallon Stetson, and the grizzled,
wounded voice you hear on the American Recordings albums was just one of many
registers in which he could sing.

One of the more revealing recordings of the Cash-Rubin collaboration is the
gospel-tinged If I Give My Soul, on Unearthed. According to Rubin, Cash began
singing the song in a broad, stagy style. (He had just come off a concert tour.)
Rubin interrupted Cash; he wanted a more intimate performance. The Unearthed
version begins at this point: The singer intones "Get off-stage, Cash" and drops
into his quiet, reflective, "soul-baring" mode.

That moment reminds you what Johnny Cash was, on his first Sun Records
recordings in 1955, during the final Rubin sessions just weeks prior to his
death, and all those decades in between: a pro.

Cash's Grip Barely Slips as Tech Advances

BYLINE: David Heun

SECTION: DEBIT & PREPAID Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 754  words


Cash has been notoriously stubborn in light of the relentless onslaught of new
payment methods, though it has started a very slow decline.

New data from the Link ATM network in the U.K. indicates consumer use of cash in
that country fell below the 50% mark for the first time last year. The news
falls in line with statistics released a year ago from thePayments Councilin the
U.K. that noted, for the first time in 2014, that consumers and businesses in
the country were making more non-cash payments than cash payments.

But those particular stats relating to cash payments vs. plastic card or mobile
payments noted that even if businesses are cutting back on cash payments,
consumers still considered cash a favorite payment method - to the tune of 52%
of their transactions in 2014.

The council predicted that consumer number would fall below 50% when 2016 stats
were ultimately compiled, but Link ATM says it has happened already.

Still, cash is holding onto a position that many other payment methods consider
out of reach.

"By volume, cash represents 50% of all transactions in the U.K., meaning more
than all other payment types put together," said Gareth Lodge, a London-based
industry analyst with Celent.

The Link forecast does suggest a large drop in volumes of nearly a third for
cash use over the course of the past decade, Lodge said. "Yet, it still
forecasts more than 11 billion transactions."

Putting those numbers in context, that is more cash payments than the combined
total of faster payments, wire, direct debit or direct credit accounts today,
Lodge added.

Getting a true read on the staying power or dwindling importance of cash
"depends on who you talk to" because the payments industry is so diverse, said
industry analyst Russ Schoper of Atlanta, Ga.-based Business Development
International Inc.

"Some areas of the world, with the U.K. being one of them, are seeing less cash
in circulation," Schoper said. "Here in the U.S. a large portion of our society
still wants to carry and use cash."

Younger consumers are using less cash, and some banks are converting to cashless
bank branches, Schoper added. "ATM networks are also consolidating or acquiring
ISOs to drive other services through an ATM other than just cash withdrawal."

Aite Consulting Group, in its most recent report on cash use in the U.S. filed
in 2011, predicted the use of cash would decline in the U.S. by nearly $200
billion by 2015. At the same time, the consulting firm said such a drop "would
not signal the beginning of a cashless society" mainly because some age groups
will continue to use cash more than others.

If the use of cash were to decline by 17% every five years, then the use of cash
in the U.S. still wouldn't fall below $1 billion until nearly 200 years from
now, Aite said at that time.

Still, a move away from cash is becoming increasingly apparent in certain
business sectors. Quick-service restaurants and coffee shops remain popular
venues for consumers to use cash, though mobile payments and plastic cards have
an increased presence in this sector. However, some major chains, most
notablyStarbucksandTaco Bell, have moved to online ordering and pickup at the
store in a strategy that discourages cash payments in the store.

But it remains a slow process, one in which cash remains resilient.

A year ago, a similar data report from theATM Industry Associationand Tremont
Capital Group made it clear that the rise in mobile payments was having little
impact on the use of cash. In fact, ATMIA cited a cash circulation increase of
8.9% on average year over year across 30 countries from 2009 to 2013.

The organization felt a technology shift to more digital and mobile payments
over the next five years would result in only a "negligible shift" from cash to
mobile.

As much as any other factor, the cost of payments and fear of losing business
may drive more cash-driven businesses to move toward mobile or cards, Celent's
Lodge said.

"Taxis used to never take cards because of the cost of the transaction," Lodge
said. "Now, with Uber, they can't afford not to. Yet at the same time, there are
now more options and more competition, with mobile POS devices for example, that
make it much easier to accept cards."

During the last 10 years, cash payment volumes have reduced by 28%, according to
the Link data. The ATM network predicts an even steeper drop in the next 10
years, fueled mostly by debit, contactless and mobile payments. Link says a 34%
drop in the number of cash payments to 11.3 billion could occur by 2025.

Cash defined coolacross generations

Johnny Cash was cool. There was something so rugged, so independent

and so original about him that even the MTV crowd recognized how cool he was,
nominating him in several categories at this year's video awards.

Weakened by a variety of ailments over the past several years, Cash died at
Baptist Hospital in Nashville Friday morning from complications due to diabetes.

His passing brought to an end not only five decades of writing and recording
some of the best (and a couple of the worst) songs in country music, but also a
life that at times approached mythic proportions, at least in fans' minds, as
the gravelly voiced singer struggled with sin and redemption, love and loss,
desire and satiation both on and off the stage.

How cool was he? As a 23-year-old bass-voiced country newcomer, he was invited
to jam with Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins at the Sun Records
studio in Memphis, Tenn. The one-time grouping would later be referred to as the
Million Dollar Quartet.

How cool was he? On his second single, the haunting Folsom Prison Blues, he
anticipated gangsta rap by four decades when he sang the immortal line, "I shot
a man in Reno just to watch him die."

How cool was he? He invented the concept of "crossover," taking huge country
hits like I Walk the Line and Ring of Fire from the country-western charts to
the pop charts.

How cool was he? By the '60s he became known as "The Man in Black" due to his
trademark black outfits.

He was the first pop singer to understand the aggressively neutral and vaguely
sinister message conveyed by wearing black on stage, and to this day that look
is emulated.

How cool was he? Cool enough to undercut his outlaw image by singing duets with
wife June Carter Cash on songs like Jackson and If I Were a Carpenter. It was a
groundbreaking career move; subsequent tours featured any number of Cash
relatives and in-laws on stage. Two became stars: daughter Roseanne Cash and
stepdaughter Carlene Carter.

How cool was he? Cool enough to embrace musical shifts that seemed on the
surface to be undercutting his own country-western base. When protest music
drove country artists like Merle Haggard to the right, Cash recorded with Bob
Dylan.

How cool was he? When drugs were at their peak of music-industry glamour, Cash
managed -- with stops at both Hazelden and the Betty Ford Clinic -- to quit a
lengthy habit.

How cool was he? When law-and-order was the order of the day, Cash performed for
prisoners at San Quentin and other high-security lockups.

When the music industry went one way, Cash almost always went the other way --
his way. Of all the artists who came and went during his five professional
decades, Cash was one of the very few who never seemed to be holding a wetted
finger up to the wind to determine how best to further his career.

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine/I keep my eyes wide open all the
time/I keep the ends out for the tie that binds/Because you're mine, I walk the
line. (I Walk the Line by Johnny Cash)

Cash was a less complex figure when he arrived on the musical scene, one of the
promising young men, along with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Perkins, in Sam
Phillips' Sun Records stable back in 1955. Backed by the Tennessee Two --
guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant -- Cash zipped up the charts
with Cry, Cry, Cry, I Walk the Line, and, presaging his lifelong empathy for the
marginalized and his flair for writing lyrics of classical simplicity, Folsom
Prison Blues.

Those early songs, neither entirely rockabilly nor country, a little folkie and
a little bluesy, became the model for almost everything Cash did later. Stripped
down and utterly distinctive, they were underpinned by the famous
boom-chicka-boom rhythm that, regular and primal as a heartbeat, recalls the
clickety-clack of trains.

Cash's voice, part dry-land farmer, part Old Testament prophet, emerges from and
absolutely dominates the austere musical accompaniment. With little of consuming
instrumental interest in his songs, the listener is forced back again and again
to Cash's vocals, which seem forged from his hardscrabble background: picking
350 pounds of cotton a day as the child of an Arkansas sharecropper; a brief
stint on an automobile assembly line; four years in the Air Force, where he
learned to play guitar; a failed career as a newly married appliance salesman in
Memphis before finally auditioning at Sun Records.

Craggy, rough-hewn and limited in range, Cash's voice is ideally suited to the
unadorned lyrics of his songs, says Michael Streissguth, editor of Ring of Fire:
The Johnny Cash Reader. "The voice juts out from the landscape. It's a perfect
partner with (early Cash hits) Big River and Five Feet High and Rising. Do you
want Elvis singing Big River? In fact, Cash calls himself a stylist, and fans
accepted it wasn't the best voice, but it was part of the package, like Dylan."

By 1958, the year Cash left Sun Records for a 28-year run with Columbia Records,
that voice had carved out a seemingly permanent home on the country and pop
charts with hits like Ballad of a Teenage Queen (his biggest selling single
ever), Guess Things Happen That Way, and others. Cash had a upward trajectory of
hits with I Still Miss Someone, Don't Take Your Guns to Town and, in 1963, the
blockbuster Ring of Fire, written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore at a time
when Carter met and fell for the still-married Cash.

He also released a series of albums chronicling the American experience,
including Bitter Tears, with its controversial single The Ballad of Ira Hayes,
Peter LaFarge's song about the tragic downfall of a Native American.

Exhausted by a rigorous touring schedule, Cash began popping uppers in 1959 and
quickly became addicted. He spent much of the 1960s in a fog, receiving a
suspended jail sentence for trying to smuggle amphetamines across the Mexican
border, getting booted from the Grand Ole Opry for kicking out the footlights,
and nearly dying from a drug overdose.

It was June Carter who pulled Cash out of his drug habit in 1967, in part by
reconverting him to the fundamentalist Christianity he'd been raised on. That
was the beginning of Cash's second coming.

I hear the train a comin'/it's rollin"round the bend/And I ain't seen the
sunshine since I don't know when/I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps
draggin' on. (Folsom Prison by Johnny Cash)

In 1967, the recently divorced Cash proposed to the twice-divorced Carter on
stage in London, Ont., and they were married the next year, he bringing four
daughters and she two to the union. Their son, John Carter Cash, was born two
years later.

In 1968, Cash also recorded one of his career highlights, the live album Johnny
Cash at Folsom Prison and, the next year, Live at San Quentin.

"The guards were scared to death," Cash later said of the San Quentin show. "All
the convicts were standing up on the dining tables -- all I would have had to do
was say 'Break!' and they were gone, man."

The success of the two prison albums, especially San Quentin, which spun off the
Grammy-winning single A Boy Named Sue, helped propel Cash onto network
television (Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart, from the Folsom Prison
album, had less impact). The Johnny Cash Show ran weekly from 1969 to 1971, with
Cash's taste in guests -- from Bob Dylan to the Who -- both eclectic and
informed.

Cash held his own through most of the 1970s, touring relentlessly and recording
hits like Oney and One Piece at a Time, both about blue-collar settling of
accounts with overlords. He chummed with Billy Graham, played for President
Richard Nixon at the White House, and then confounded everybody by stating, in a
1973 interview, "As far as the war in Vietnam is concerned, that war just made
me sick." He also got involved in benefit work on behalf of prisoners and Native
Americans.

By the 1980s, Cash was slipping off the charts, a victim of "The Urban Cowboy
craze and all that," he told music writer Nick Tosches in the mid-1990s. "So I
kind of pulled back -- and forgot about tryin' to make really good records
because nobody was really interested in 'em."

Revitalized in the late 1960s, Johnny Cash did it again in the mid-1990s with
the American Recordings series produced by Rick Rubin. The four albums -- at
once as sombre and hopeful as anything Cash had ever done, never approached the
sales figures of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, but did enjoy substantial press
-- were generally lauded by critics and, with songs by Tom Petty, U2 and Will
Oldham among the scattering of Cash originals and traditional songs, quickly won
the hearts of young hipsters. Cash was at work on the fifth album in the
American Recordings series when he died.

"I don't see him (Cash) as a country act," said Rubin in a 1994 interview. "He's
an outlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is."

But it's not the seamed face of an aging Johnny Cash that will be remembered, an
old fellow with 80-plus records and 8,000 days on the road to his credit.
Instead, it's the broad-shouldered and trim-hipped artist of his middle years,
striding to the microphone in a black preacher's coat to say, "Hello, I'm Johnny
Cash."

"I don't see anybody poised to be such a meaningful figure in country music or
anybody embodying the human experience and articulating the American experience
the way Cash did," says Streissguth. "He had foibles and was public about them
and dealt with them. I think we saw our hope, our promise for redemption, in
him."

Bizarre cash legacy of the dotcom dozen

BYLINE: Andrew Leach

SECTION: Pg. 7

LENGTH: 1005 words


IT sounds like an investor's dream. Pay out one pound and in return you get GBP
1.57 in cash.

Too good to be true? Not necessarily. The bursting of the dotcom bubble has
created a bizarre situation where a dozen former technology high-flyers have
stock market values that are less than their bank balances.

They raised cash from investors at the peak of the City's infatuation with
technology.

Their share prices later collapsed but not before they had banked the funds from
their backers.

A study by independent research firm Equity Investigator uncovered a dozen
technology companies whose stock market values are lower than their estimated
cash balances at the end of the financial year.

The 12 companies had a combined stock market value of GBP 179.5 million last
week.

Yet even after spending cash in the current financial year, they will be left
with a total cash pile of GBP 281 million. This means they sell at an average 36
per cent discount.

Discounts across the dozen include online business directories company Scoot,
whose shares trade at 77 per cent below its cash holdings.

And computer chip maker Zen Research's stock market value is 58 per cent less
than the money in its bank account.

The dozen underline the fall from grace of shares that were boom stocks just a
few years ago and which took advantage of strong markets to raise hundreds of
millions of pounds.

Max Thowless-Reeves, an analyst with Equity Investigator, said: 'This situation
with companies valued at less than their cash began to emerge in the
third-quarter of last year and has gathered pace.

'It is a legacy of the tech boom and because it has not happened on this scale
before, there is no precedent for what companies should do.'

Inevitably, some companies have chosen to break up. Others have faced pressure
from shareholders to return cash.

If those shareholders bought into the companies at their peak, they would still
face a loss, but at least it would not be as great as the paper loss that they
are now showing on their shares.

Last year, internet firm J2C returned GBP 34 million to shareholders a few
months after its share price slumped, valuing the group at just GBP 21.9
million.

And another internet company, Izodia, which Equity Investigator reckons will end
this year with GBP 30.2 million in cash after starting it with GBP 55.7 million,
has seen its market value rise from a lowly GBP 16 million to GBP 32.7 million.
Last week it was put up for sale.

So who are the cash-rich dozen? And what are the chances of some or all of their
cash being returned to shareholders, either through management action or
shareholder pressure?

Wobbly stocks get wake-up call

BYLINE: Angus Grigg

SECTION: COMPUTERS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 483 words


The Australian Stock Exchange reminded up to 20 recently listed companies of
their reporting and directors' responsibilities yesterday, after concern that
some may not have sufficient cash reserves to continue operating.

An ASX spokesman said the warnings had been given to companies who had cash
reserves to survive six months or less at their current burn rate.

The ASX required clarification of how these companies would be funded, whether
their business plans remained viable and whether a pick-up in revenues was
expected.

The ASX requires 122 companies which have listed since May last year and have
more than 50 per cent of their assets in cash to lodge quarterly cash-flow
statements.

Melbourne-based Lion Equities was suspended by the ASX yesterday after failing
to lodge its cash-flow statement by the opening of business yesterday. It is
likely to be re-listed this morning after meeting the requirements just before
the market's close.

"The ASX reserves the right to seek assurance that a company's financial
position is adequate to warrant the quotation of its securities," the spokesman
said.

Meanwhile, statements lodged yesterday indicated that the cash-burn rates of
Spike Networks and BMCMedia.com blew out in the June quarter.

Spike spent $35.7 million in the year to June 30 on operating and investing
activities, mainly associated with the cash-hungry Spike Radio and the
restructure of its web services business away from the US and towards Asia.

The company had negative operating cash flows of $4.1 million over the quarter
but did not disclose the exact nature of the spend, reporting $3.6 million as
"other" cash outgoings.

Spike recently told the ASX it expected a loss of $27 million for the 2000
financial year, mainly from Spike Radio and the termination of its US services
business.

Despite its heavy cash-burn rate, Spike has $21.7 million in cash after the
formation of a joint venture with Pacific Century CyberWorks and a cash
injection from the Hong Kong giant.

Internet advertising firm BMCMedia.com had negative cash flows of $3.5 million
over the quarter, representing $1.2 million a month, compared to $860,000 a
month in the first quarter.

The increase came from a 26 per cent rise in staff numbers to 115 as it
continued to expand into Asia, opening offices in Taiwan and China.

Recently listed magazine and internet publisher Terraplanet.com said it had
burned through only $22,000 in the June quarter and had $9.7 million in cash
left.

Cash Flow: Timing is everything

BYLINE: The Current-Argus

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 673 words


By Leslie Hoffman, Director of Lending and Client Service, ACCION New MexicoEver
had a friend who seemed to have it all high-paying job, nice car, beautiful home
and plenty of toys to fill the garage? But at the end of the month, your
successful friend doesn't seem to have $10 to his name. Turns out he has been
pouring all those earnings into the house, the car and the toys. Perhaps he can
afford them all, but he could certainly use a lesson in cash flow management.
This illustrates a critical lesson for business owners: profitable companies can
go bankrupt. It may seem counterintuitive a business that lands in the black can
simultaneously be putting itself out of business. But business owners who fail
to manage cash flow can find themselves much like that friend with positive
earnings but no cash to pay bills.The first step is to create a cash budget a
powerful financial tool that helps you monitor and manage cash inflows and
outflows, plan for excesses and deficiencies of cash, and decide when you need
to borrow and when you can pay back loans. Having a better handle on the
collection and payment of cash can forestall the kind of cash crises that plague
many small businesses and can lead to bankruptcy, even if the business is
profitable. While it is important to budget for sales, it is critical to budget
for cash collections when you will be paid for the goods and services you
provide. Equally important is to budget for cash payments when your vendors or
suppliers are required to be paid. Timing is the key: unless you operate a cash
-only business, sales do not equal cash collections, and expenses do not equal
cash payments. Many businesses extend credit and, thus, are paid sometime after
the sale is made. Likewise, many businesses pay vendors after the goods or
services have been received.A cash budget can be created by adding all of your
expected cash inflows to your bank balance at the beginning of the month, then
subtracting expected cash outflows to determine how much cash will remain at
month's end.For example, let's say your company has been earning a profit, and
thanks to strong recent sales, is on target to exceed last month's income. You
project $22,000 in sales this month and you started the month with $4,000 cash
in the bank.Based on historical trends, you project that of the $22,000 in
sales, you will only receive $12,000 since $10,000 of it will be sold on credit.
You also expect to collect $3,000 the business is still owed from last month's
sales. Based on this, you expect your cash receipts everything that represents
an inflow of cash to be $15,000. During the month you must pay $12,000 for the
purchase of new inventory and $8,000 for wages. These cash disbursements -
everything that represents a cash payment amount to $20,000.Given this scenario,
your business would actually be running a cash deficit of $1,000 and you will
need to scramble to find cash to pay bills. Remember that this is the same
business that is earning a net profit before taxes of $3,000 on sales of $23,000
less expenses of $20,000. If you already have an accountant, you should sit down
with her or him to talk about building a set of budgeted financial statements.
If you're just getting started and want to learn more about the basics of cash
flow, there are a number of small business development resources out there ready
to help. Organizations that offer classes and workshops include the Small
Business Development Center Network www.nmsbdc.org, WESST Corp (www.wesst.org)
and SCORE (www.score.org).Dr. Alistair Preston, professor of accounting at the
University of New Mexico Anderson School of Management contributed to this
article.Finance New Mexico is an initiative of the New Mexico Small Business
Investment Corporation (NMSBIC) and its partners to assist individuals and
businesses in obtaining skills and funding-resources for their business or idea.

Cash flow is king when judging a company's prospects

BYLINE: GARY WHITE

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 828 words


The City cheered results from oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell last week,
despite a slump in profitability. It's all down to cash - or, rather, better
cash management. This is the ultimate test of a company's ability to create real
value out of its assets.

For investors, cash really is king. Keeping an eye on what a business is doing
with its money can give you a good handle on its prospects. So, it is vital
investors are comfortable looking at how a company uses its cash - and use this
information to inform their investment decisions.

Many ignore cash flow and focus on profits and revenues alone. This is a
mistake. The cash flow statement is just as important as the balance sheet or
income statement in a company's accounts.

With the majority of investors owning shares in oil companies for their income,
good cash management is vital to keep the dividend pipe flowing. Free cash flow
is very important as it is from this pot that dividends are paid.

A quick and easy way of working out an approximate free cash flow figure is to
take the operating cash flow number from the cash flow statement and subtract
capital expenditures. You will then have a figure which is roughly the cash
generated by the company after it has invested in maintaining and growing its
business.

Following a profit warning in January, Shell's new chief executive Ben van
Beurden unveiled a strategy that aimed to boost its cash by managing its
business better, by making investments and disposing of non-core assets.

The group's cash flow hit $14bn (£8.3bn) in the first quarter, up 21pc from a
year ago and more than double the $6bn seen in the fourth quarter of 2013. This
was ahead of market expectations. BP also said it was on track to meet its
target of $30bn-$31bn in operating cash flow for the year, compared with $22bn
in 2013. Both these statements cheered City analysts.

Investors had been critical of the returns both companies have generated from
their invested capital over the last few years. A similar situation has been
seen in mining - a sector arguably ahead of the game when compared with oil
majors. BHP reported a £7.8bn increase in free cash flow at the interim stage,
by employing a similar strategy to BP and Shell. But the oil groups' cash
strategy could end up having more of an impact, because oil prices have held up
significantly better than the price of metals in the last few years.

Looking at cash flows can also identify companies where the dividend outlook is
negative.

For example, rail and bus operator FirstGroup is expected to have negative free
cash flow for a number of years. Morgan Stanley is forecasting a negative free
cash flow of £82.3m this year, rising to £90.5m in 2015. The company cancelled
its dividend last year, as it needs to use its cash to service its debt pile. It
did not make an interim payment but hinted that it may make a payment alongside
its final results, due to be issued on May 21.

FirstGroup's board "expects to propose a final dividend of up to £50m for the
year to 31 March 2014, as a transition to a progressive dividend policy
thereafter", it said in November. However, some in the City think that, given
the state of its free cash flow, it should reconsider making any payment until
it becomes cash generative.

"A significant part of FirstGroup's cash flow pressure comes from servicing
debt," broker Jefferies said last month. "For us, dividends look inappropriate
for now."

Of course, it is too simplistic to say that a fall in free cash flow is always a
bad thing. A company may be making large investments that will provide a
significant return in the future. A good recent example of this is Deutsche
Telekom, which slashed its guidance for 2015 free cash flow in March. Management
lowered its target of (EURO)6bn (£4.9bn) of free cash flow next year to
(EURO)4.2bn, down from (EURO)4.6bn in 2013.

"We could achieve our original ambition level for 2015 if we were to slam the
door in the face of the customer rush in the US. That's not what we want," said
Thomas Dannenfeldt, Deutsche Telekom's chief financial officer. "The market is
offering us the opportunity to achieve a different ambition: value-driven
customer growth in the US that translates into an increase in the value of the
company."

And if a company is stopping investment in its business merely to make cash
flows look better this could store up problems further down the line. There is
always a judgment call for an investor to make when looking at cash movements
and the market has judged that BP and Shell are now spending their money much
more wisely.

Both BP and Shell - the most significant dividend payers in the FTSE 100 -
appear to be taking steps in the right direction to return to sustainable
dividend growth. But one swallow does not a summer make. This needs to be
sustained - for the sake of income seekers across the UK and beyond.

Stevenson returns next week

Cost analysis;
Farm Bureau leader says cash-rent prices need to be lowered

BYLINE: CHARLYN FARGO Agribusiness Editor

SECTION: MARKETPLACE; Pg. 37

LENGTH: 890 words


In the country, the subject of cash rents is hotter than the latest piece of
land for sale.

That's because more landowners are asking for cash-rent arrangements instead of
traditional crop-share leases, and because cash-rent prices have risen steadily.
Two years ago, the University of Illinois made a controversial decision to phase
all of its leases from crop-sharing to cash rent during a five-year time period.
Farm groups asked the university to reconsider. They argued that crop-shares are
fairer to farmers and would be a more appropriate arrangement for a land grant
university established to help farmers.

Despite the plea, the university has plowed ahead in its embrace of cash rents.

"We're continuing with the plan," said Tom Hardy, spokesman for the U of I. "And
we're making pretty good progress."

Last week, however, Illinois Farm Bureau President Philip Nelson said cash-rent
prices need to be lower to keep farmers in business.

"Two years ago, net farm income was $92,000, and over half of that was
attributed to government farm support," Nelson said. "Last week, a University of
Illinois study put net farm income at $20,000 to $30,000, and if you took away
the farm program, it would be a negative figure. Sooner or later, that's going
to catch up with farmers. Cash rents need to be adjusted. They're just too high
given the current returns."

However, Gary Schnitkey, U of I Extension specialist doesn't expect a decline in
2006.

He estimates cash rents in central Illinois average about $145 an acre.

"Both northern and southern Illinois would be a little lower than that,"
Schnitkey said. "On the other hand, if that's the average, some farmers are
paying more than $200 an acre. The trend is still going up."

The trend is an increase of 1 percent a year, he said.

"I think we're at 50-50 cash rents to crop-share right now," Schnitkey said.
"But that shifts 1 percent a year to more cash rents. I don't see that slowing
any."

For the 2003 and 2004 crop years, farmers were able to make money at fairly high
cash rents. That's not always been the case, Schnitkey said.

"Farmers made money at $180 to $190 per acre cash rent," he said. "Those aren't
typical years. What we're seeing now is cash rents are still up, and costs are
up, so the total return has to go down. At some point the line is going to
cross."

Scott Halpin of Gardner rents some land.

"Most landlords favor it," Halpin said. "In our area, ground doesn't change
hands much, so the cash rents aren't overinflated. They've been fairly stable."

Bob Phelps farms in northern Illinois in Winnebago County.

"We haven't seen cash rents come down any, but I don't think they're out of
control," Phelps said. "I'm glad Philip Nelson is addressing this issue. It
needs to be said. That's a strong statement he made from a leader of a farm
organization who has as many landlords as active tenant farmers in the
membership. The marketplace keeps driving cash rents up."

Phelps has both crop-share and cash-rent agreements in his own farming
operation.

"We recently switched one to cash rent because of the age of the landowner. It
made it easier for him."

Ken Taylor, a farmer from Wayne County, doesn't cash rent any of his land.

"I'd like to keep it that way," said Taylor. "I think cash rents are always more
advantageous to the landlord. Cash rent is like buying at Wal-Mart. Our area is
one of the last areas to still have much crop share."

Kevin Miller of Teutopolis in Effingham County sees more and more agreements
going to cash rent.

"In my individual operation, about half to two-thirds of my leases are now cash
rents," he said. "But it's been my preference. With the farm programs more
involved, a lot of my landowners prefer cash rent for the simplicity. In our
county, I'd say cash rents range from $90 to $150 an acre, depending on the soil
productivity."

What concerns him about more cash-rent leases is competition from other farmers.

"It opens the opportunity for a very aggressive farmer to bid up more land,"
Miller said. "And for that farmer to have severe financial problems quickly as a
result. In times of low yields, your financial exposure is high. And you end up
taking a hit."

He's seen some agreements go to variable cash rent, where the landowner and
farmer agree on a base, then adjust the rate after harvest, depending on yield
and prices.

"I like to have a landlord know my operation and want to a have a long-term
relationship," Miller said. "When you do that, they don't necessarily ask for
the top dollar. That's not the most important thing.

"But I'm sure we'll be doing more cash rents in the future. That's the way it's
going. You just have to have some reasonable common sense in doing them."

Terry Davis of Roseville thinks cash-rent agreements will continue to increase,
in number and price.

"Landlords want a guaranteed income," Davis said. "With crop prices being down
and input costs up, everyone had hoped cash rent would go down, but it's held
steady. I'm already 70 percent cash-rent, 20 percent I own and 10 percent
crop-share. The 10 percent has already hinted they'd like to switch to cash
-rent. I prefer crop-share because of the reduced risk. The landowner loses a
connection to the farm as soon as it becomes a paycheck."

Weekly Cash-Flow Analysis: Why Isn't It a "Best Practice"?

By Margie Kaufman

Boston.

TEXT:


 [*32]  Amajor part of the anatomy of any turnaround is measuring and
forecasting a company's weekly cash flows. A seemingly simple exercise, it
presents a powerful tool for supporting complex management decisions. Applied
during a restructuring process in myriad circumstances, it can also serve as a
basis for valuation or the foundation of a liquidation plan. The utility of a
weekly cash-flow analysis is agnostic to the subject business or industry.

   An essential element of any in- or out-of-court restructuring process, cash
-flow analysis is not just a tool to manage the overall business, but can be
wielded more precisely to manage cash, inventory, accounts receivable and
accounts payable, as well as bank debt and (where applicable) borrowing
availability. Understanding the flow of cash tells management how much can be
spent in any given week, based on other financial activities. Management uses
this information to facilitate decisions about how best to operate the company.

   The construction of the cash-flow model begins with the scheduling of all
necessary disbursements and the timing of such disbursements; the same process
is used for sales, collections and inventory management (either purchased or
produced). Once these schedules are pulled together and summarized, the task of
understanding the inflows and outflows begins. Then, in collaboration with
management, the process of adjusting the timing and availability of funds based
on how the business actually operates begins, with the outcome being to
determine a final weekly cash flow. With the company's weekly cash flow
finalized, management can use it to compare against the actual performance of
the business, adjusting future weeks for changes, and rolling out additional
weeks of activity as needed.

   A good example of the value of this exercise as a decision-making tool is
inventory management. A simple decision to reduce inventory has far wider
implications. For a manufacturer, it could mean a curtailment in production,
decreased payroll and benefits, and reduced overhead costs; for a distributor,
it could result in the liquidation of inventory on hand or a reduction in future
purchases. By projecting operating receipts and disbursements and then comparing
actual results to the projections on a weekly basis, a cash-flow analysis allows
management to evaluate performance and make changes more swiftly. Rather than
depending on month-end financial results to be reported, this information allows
management to take corrective actions that affect financial results in a timely
fashion.

   By analyzing stores, product lines or divisions, the cash-flow model assists
the debtor in understanding what parts of the business are or are not performing
well. Clearly, the goal is to eliminate or rehabilitate unprofitable operations,
and preserve or strengthen the core profitable business segments. Management can
use the analysis in making decisions about closing certain locations or
terminating product lines or divisions, project how changes will be implemented,
then measure results accordingly.

   In addition to assisting in a restructuring, weekly cash-flow reporting can
help various creditors understand how the company is performing, measure the
debtor's progress through the proceeding and analyze potential recoveries. This
basic tool, as the foundation of a company's discounted cash-flow valuation, is
one of three standard methodologies to determine enterprise value. By managing
to increase cash flow, a company can enhance its value in a meaningful way.
Analyzing the detail and pinpointing sources of the "cash burn" at retail
locations, product lines or divisions, and then making the necessary changes,
ultimately increases free cash flow and enterprising value. The monitoring of
weekly cash flow creates a powerful tool that management can use to make the
necessary operating changes that will help increase the company's value.

   During a bankruptcy proceeding, the weekly cash-flow projection is the
centerpiece of cash-collateral and debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing
pleadings. When a company considers filing for bankruptcy protection, it must
determine how the process will be financed. Can the company operate within the
constraints of cash collateral or does it need to seek DIP financing? The answer
to this question is informed by a cash-flow analysis that has been modified to
account for the business impact and unique costs of a bankruptcy. The answers as
to timing and quantity of financing, as well as careful scrutiny of underlying
assumptions, are also critical to obtaining needed funding and successfully
managing a bankruptcy process to its conclusion. All parties are keenly focused
on measuring results against the initial budgets underpinning the court's
granting of cash collateral usage or DIP financing, but they also aid the
debtor's preparation of monthly operating reports, as required by the court.

    [*33]  At times, maximizing recovery value for creditors necessitates the
liquidation of some or all assets of a company. Even in this instance, the
weekly cash flow or liquidation budget is utilized to measure recoveries for
secured and unsecured creditors. The timing and associated costs of liquidation
activities affect recoveries; therefore, they need to be well planned and
communicated to the parties-in-interest. As specific assets are being
liquidated, the results can be tracked and managed. If liquidation costs are
running too high, this can be quickly identified, monitored and more carefully
managed.

   Decisions as to when to close locations, production facilities or warehouses
can also be modified. Nimbleness is required, and the cash-flow implications of
alternative paths of action should be forecasted to guide the liquidation.
Monitoring the liquidation scenario is key to maximizing recoveries for creditor
constituents. Whether it is inventory liquidation, accounts-receivable
collections or the sale of equipment or real estate, all can be measured as part
of a weekly cash-flow analysis, and recoveries can be revised based on actual
results.

   Adaptable for any industry, a weekly cash-flow analysis can also be helpful
for multi-divisional and international companies. While described as a "simple
tool," the weekly cash-flow analysis can be as complex as the business requires.
It can be broken down by location (for retail stores), product lines (for
manufacturers), divisions and country locations. While the tool should not
become cumbersome and unwieldy, incorporating greater detail helps refine the
cash-profitability analysis and information utility for management when it
decides what changes are necessary to the business. Some analyses detail
disbursements by the vendor (in supporting schedules), and others detail
receipts by customers. Especially when cash is tight and active vendor
management is essential to maintaining a consistent source of supplies, such a
level of detail helps develop effective supplier payment schemes. Alternatively,
knowing when customer payments are not received as expected signals to
management that collection efforts to garner scarce cash resources may be
needed. For companies that must wire or ACH funds to vendors, it is helpful to
detail the manner in which various types of disbursements affect the flow of
cash. A wire clears on the day that it was initiated and an ACH clears the day
after it was initiated, while a check could take five to seven days to clear.
All forms of disbursements and receipts need to be tracked and accounted for in
the analysis.

   Cash-flow projections are not static analyses; they are dynamic and require
constant management and updating. As previously noted, tracking actual results
and comparing them to projections to create a variance report in order to
understand what has transpired in the business is indispensable. However, so is
"rolling out" or adjusting projected flows, as well as projecting additional
weeks. Operating results need to be measured and action plans need to be
adjusted as results become available. For those companies that have never used a
weekly cash-flow analysis, management's eyes are opened to new -- and sometimes
surprising -- insights into business operations. These include the timing of
sales during a month  [*88]  [EDITOR'S NOTE: The page numbers of this document
may appear to be out of sequence; however, this pagination accurately reflects
the pagination of the original published documents.] or season (e.g., sales may
be disproportionately concentrated at the end of the month or season), customer
cash receipts (e.g., receipts may be skewed to a given week during the month) or
completion of production.

   As results are reported and additional weeks are added to a weekly cash-flow
model, it is vital to make sure that all projected activities are adjusted based
on the most recent week(s). This may sound basic, but it is amazing how often
original projections are perpetuated without giving due consideration to the
implications of immediate past performance. For example, if a company records an
additional $ 1 million of cash receipts from receivables in a given week,
management must examine whether this cash is the result of incremental sales
from prior weeks, or having collected receivables earlier than projected. If the
latter is the case, then future receipt forecasts must be adjusted.

   If the company continually either exceeds or falls short of its weekly sales
forecast, future receipts need to be adjusted accordingly. If customer receipts
continually fall short of expectations, it may indicate that additional
collection efforts are required. In addition, if actual disbursements occur in
the week prior to the one projected, then future disbursement must be adjusted
accordingly. Management relies on the best and most current information to make
critical decisions. Keeping the cash-flow model accurately updated is a key
activity during a restructuring process, sale process or liquidation, as it
provides management with the insight needed to facilitate decisions that help
maximize value for stakeholders.

   There are additional factors that can complicate a company's weekly cash-flow
analysis. If a company's invoices based on an annual contract and receipts are
received on a sporadic basis, managing cash flow can become more difficult,
[*89]  providing yet another reason to implement the discipline of a weekly cash
-flow analysis. In a recent assignment of an educational facility, students were
invoiced monthly but payments were received inconsistently. The school had a
line of credit that it drew down as receivables continued to age. As a result of
inconsistent collection patterns, the line of credit had lots of peaks and
valleys. The school did not operate using a weekly cash-flow analysis, but once
one was established, management gained a better understanding of the inflows of
receipts and put more focus into accounts receivable collections. This effort
paid off, and the school was able to operate for two years with internal cash
flow and did not require a working-capital line of credit. In this case, the
weekly cash-flow analysis was extremely useful, as management was able to reduce
debt and better manage its operations.

   This illustration underscores the importance of a cashflow forecasting tool,
which is used by restructuring consultants all the time. In a recent review of
the business plan and operations of a company that designed, sourced and
distributed several different product lines to retailers, one of the top items
on the information request list was a weekly cash-flow forecast. This was a
business in which annual revenue was approximately $ 250 million and sales were
very seasonal, with the majority of sales occurring in July through December.
However, the company had never produced a weekly cash-flow report and were
months behind in producing financial statements.

   How is it that a company of such size does not closely manage its cash
position? The company was out of season, low on cash and unable to pay its debts
as they became due. Vendors stopped shipping new products, and fill rates to
retailers decreased. The company struggled for several months until its owner
infused cash into the business. During this stressful time, the company never
implemented a weekly cash-flow analysis. A weekly cash-flow analysis would not
have prevented the cash shortfall from happening (this was the result of other
problems from within the business); however, it would have assisted management
in ascertaining the timing and the amount of the cash shortfall, and provided an
analysis of its working capital.

   Another company with a seasonal business (with two seasons), knowing that it
would run out of cash by the end of the second season, only prepared a weekly
cash-flow analysis at the insistence of its outside consultant. This company,
which provided services over a short time period, did not recognize its revenue
when invoiced, but rather in equal segments over the time of the contract. In
this instance, the monthly operating statement differed materially from the cash
-flow and balance-sheet analyses, and cash-flows should have been monitored more
closely. With management's involvement, the weekly cash-flow analysis was
prepared and continues to be monitored. Corporate leaders now make decisions
based on the weekly update and review of cash flows.

   These are a few examples of how a weekly cash-flow analysis can be a powerful
tool to assist management in making decisions about how to operate a business
while maximizing value for its shareholders and creditors. For a company trying
to increase the value of its business in a potential sale or liquidation
scenario, daily decisions in a restructuring process can be made easier with the
use of weekly cash-flow analysis. While too many companies still do not use a
weekly cash-flow analysis as part of their daily management decisions, the
adoption of such a tool should become a "best practice" for all management
teams.

hyperWALLET to integrate with PayNearMe to offer cash-payment acceptance options

LENGTH: 507 words


PayNearMe allows consumers to use cash to buy goods online, pay utility bills,
make rent payments and repay loans, all via convenient printable or mobile
barcode technology. PayNearMe's innovative cash-payment option is processed at
nearly 10,000 participating 7-Eleven and ACE Cash Express stores across the US.

The integration with PayNearMe will enable hyperWALLET, whose global payment
solutions and brandable prepaid-card products are utilized by over 150
corporations worldwide, to offer cash as a payment acceptance option for the
first time. This new cash-payment acceptance capability will be available to
hyperWALLET's customers in early 2014.

"We are pleased to expand our array of supported payment options," states Bill
Crowley, Vice President of Product and Services at hyperWALLET Systems Inc.
"With PayNearMe, hyperWALLET will offer our corporate customers the ability to
add cash payment options directly into their e-commerce websites."

More than 25% of US consumers regularly transact in cash and cash equivalents
because they either don't have a bank account or choose not to rely on automatic
payments, checks and credit cards. The partnership with PayNearMe allows
hyperWALLET's corporate customers to expand their payment options to better
serve these cash-paying consumers.

Companies in the direct-selling industry are expected to benefit the most
because consumers in this market often buy goods from distributors with cash.
These distributors then need an easy way to use this cash to order new goods
from the parent company.

"PayNearMe is a great alternative for the underbanked demographic, or for those
who simply prefer to pay with cash," said Mr. Crowley. "We believe our
integration with PayNearMe will offer substantial value to a variety of
companies including direct selling organizations, as it will enable their
distributors to pay with cash for products ordered via their websites."

"Cash in circulation has grown 42% since 2008; yet, cash-paying consumers are
still finding it difficult to participate in the digital economy because most
online businesses only accept credit and debit cards," said Danny Shader, CEO of
PayNearMe. "The ability to offer cash as a fast, simple and essential payment
option will help hyperWALLET's corporate customers expedite business
transactions and open up new markets."

Numerous businesses, such as property management companies, utility providers
and financial institutions offer PayNearMe as a payment option to their
customers.

To make a payment, individuals bring their cash payment and mobile or printed
PayNearMe PaySlip to a local 7-Eleven or ACE Cash Express store. PaySlips, which
can be printed on paper or rendered on the screen of a smartphone, include a
unique barcode and cash payment instructions. At the store, the cashier scans
the barcode, accepts the payment and issues a receipt confirming that the
payment was accepted and processed. There are no forms to fill out, and the
user's account is credited immediately. The whole process takes less than a
minute.

NCR Set to Make Move into Cash Handler/Recycler Field

BYLINE: Frederick H. Lowe, ATM&Debit News

SECTION: CARDS; Pg. 13 Vol. 174 No. 13

LENGTH: 570  words


NCR Corp. plans to offer cash-handling and cash-recycling machines, a market
that is taking off as the U.S. automated teller machine market is maturing.

Bill Nuti, NCR's chairman and chief executive officer, said its expertise in
making ATMs will help it expand quickly in the adjacent space.

"It's in our wheelhouse. We will be No. 1 in this market," Mr. Nuti said during
a meeting with analysts last month.

Cash-recycling and cash-handling machines are used in branches to count and
dispense bank notes and coins, and some banks say they can reduce employee
turnover.

NCR's top rivals in the ATM market, Diebold Inc. and Wincor Nixdorf AG, already
offer cash-recycling and cash-handling systems to banks.

Lee Manfred, a partner with First Annapolis Consulting Inc.in Linthicum, Md.,
said NCR is responding to slower growth and increased competition for its core
ATM business. "The ATM markets are maturing in the U.S., and NCR is leveraging
its knowledge of ATM technology to enter another vertical market," he said.

Nicole Sturgill, a research director for delivery systems at TowerGroup Inc. in
Needham, Mass., an independent research firm owned byMasterCard Inc., said the
machines are a logical next step for NCR. "NCR doesn't have to reinvent the
wheel" to enter this market, she said.

Cash-recycling and cash-handling systems have "passed the proof-of-concept stage
with banks," Ms Sturgill said.

She projects thatover the next four years U.S. banks will spend $8.4 billion
automating their branches, and 7% to 10% of that amount will go toward
teller-assist units, such as cashhandlers and cash recyclers.

Banks install cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines at teller stations;
recyclers accept notes and coins that customers deposit, and handlers (sometimes
called dispensers) can dispense cash to tellers or customers. Both automatically
track the incoming and outgoing funds.

Banks consider both machines keys to reducing expenses because they help cut
turnover. Banks often must terminate tellers who cannot provide an accurate
count of deposits, Ms. Sturgill said.

"Cash-recycling machines eliminate the need for several tellers to check each
other's count for accuracy," she said.

Cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines also give banks an accurate count of
the types of bank notes they dispense to customers.

"The bank may think it dispenses X amount of tens, fives, twenties, and
hundreds, but a cash-dispensing machine may show something different, which
would reduce the amount of the cash a branch needs," Ms. Sturgill said.

NCR will also be taking on a partner, Talaris Ltd. (formerly De La Rue Cash
Systems), the industry leader in banknotecounting, banknoterecycling, and
coincounting, the analysts said.

Talaris manufactures desktop cash-handling products and ATM technology for
original-equipment manufacturers, and it supplies some internal mechanisms for
NCR teller machines.

NCR, of Dayton, Ohio, signaled its intent to move into the cash-recycling, cash
-handling, and coin-counting markets in August when it purchased NCI Ltd., a
London company that develops teller-connectivity software that enables banks and
credit unions to automate teller functions.

Before NCR bought NCI, Talaris was listed on NCI's Web site as the exclusive
distributor of the software.

The purchase makes it easier for NCR and its bank customers "to introduce and
integrate branch-automation technologies," Mr. Nuti said then.

ATM Maker Enters Cash-Handling And Cash-Recycling Market

BYLINE: Frederick H. Lowe

SECTION: ATM NEWS; Pg. 1 Vol. 9 No. 2

LENGTH: 1014  words


NCR Corp. is joining rival ATM manufacturers and one of its suppliers in
entering the cash-handling and cash-recycling market, which is taking off as the
U.S. market for ATMs is maturing.

Bill Nuti, chairman and CEO of Dayton, Ohio-based NCR, told analysts in early
December he expects the company to dominate the market. "It's in our wheelhouse.
We will be No. 1 in this market," Nuti claimed.

NCR, like rivals Diebold Inc. and Wincor Nixdorf AG, is using knowledge derived
from manufacturing ATMs to develop products for banks, and it using its years of
contacts with financial institutions to sell cash-recycling and cash-handling
machines.

The machines count and dispense bank notes and coins. They also reduce costly
bank-employee turnover, proponents say.

NCR's decision to enter this market is the result of a confluence of issues. The
most-important one concerns the slow growth and the increased competition NCR
and its competitors are seeing in the U.S. market for ATMs, says Lee Manfred,
partner with First Annapolis Consulting Inc. in Linthicum, Md.

"The ATM markets are maturing in the U.S., and NCR is leveraging its knowledge
of ATM technology to enter another vertical market to grow revenues," Manfred
says.

Nicole Sturgill, research director for delivery systems at TowerGroup Inc., a
Needham, Mass.-based consulting firm, agrees. "NCR doesn't have to reinvent the
wheel [to enter this market]," she says.

Cash-recycling and cash-handling systems have "passed the proof of concept stage
with banks that have been testing the machines for the past 18 to 24 months,"
Sturgill says.

Over the next four years, Sturgill expects U.S. banks to spend $8.4 billion
automating their branches. Of that amount, banks will spend 7% to 10% on
teller-assist units, which include cash-dispense units and cash recyclers, she
adds.

Not everyone shares Sturgill's optimistic view. Gil Luria, vice president of
research for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, for example, says he does
not expect a lot of branch growth in the United States and Western Europe.

Banks install the cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines behind teller
stations. Cash-recycling machines accept bank notes and coins bank customers
deposit with tellers. The machine counts the money and give the bank an accurate
record of the amount bank customers have deposited with the financial
institution.

Cash-dispensing machines dispense bank notes and coins to tellers to give to
bank customers.

Banks consider both machines keys to reducing branch expenses because they help
cut employee turnover. Banks typically fire tellers who repeatedly do not
provide the bank with an accurate count of deposits, Sturgill says.

Branch turnover is a costly expense. TowerGroup says 53% of part-time employees
and 25% full-time employees leave branches annually.

"Cash recycling machines eliminate the need for several tellers to check each
other's count for accuracy," Sturgill says.

Cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines also give banks an accurate count of
the types of bank notes they dispense to customers. "The bank may think it
dispenses X amount of 10s, 5s, 20s and 100s, but a cash-dispensing machine may
show something different, which would reduce the amount of the cash a branch
needs," Sturgill says.

In announcing its intentions, NCR, the world's largest ATM manufacturer based on
2007 shipments, is taking on Talaris Ltd., formerly De La Rue Cash Systems, the
industry leader in the banknote-counting, banknote-recycling and coin-counting
fields, observers say.

Talaris manufactures branch teller-automation products, desktop cash-handling
products and ATM technology for original-equipment manufacturers, and it
supplies internal mechanisms for NCR ATMs, Sue Foster, a Talaris spokesperson,
tells ATM&Debit News. Foster did not know what the internal mechanisms involved.

It is not unusual for a company to compete with one of its suppliers, Sturgill
says.

Cash Systems has a long history in the ATM business. The company installed the
world's first ATM in 1967 at Barclays Bank in London. Basingstok, England-based
Cash Systems founded the cash-recycling industry with the world's first machine
in 1985.

Talaris, which has offices in 14 countries and has market-leading positions in
Spain, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and North America, says it is capable
of processing more than 500 million banknotes each day.

The Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C-based investment firm, participated in a
management buyout that led to the purchase of De La Rue's cash-handling and ATM
technologies in August for $520 million. In September, Carlyle Group named De La
Rue's cash-handling business Talaris.

Besides competing with Talaris, NCR also will face off with rival Diebold, which
is based in Canton, Ohio.

Competitors See The Same Market

Last summer, Washington Trust Co. of Providence, R.I., opened a branch in
downtown Providence that housed Diebold's Express Cash Recycler, which dispenses
cash and automatically counts and verifies customer deposits (ADN, 6/26/08)
Paderborn, Germany-based Wincor Nixdorf, the world's second-largest ATM
manufacturer based on 2007 shipments, sells cash-recycling and cash-dispensing
machines in Europe, Sturgill says.

NCR signaled its intention to move into the cash-recycling, cash-handling and
coin-counting markets in August when the manufacturer purchased NCI Ltd., a
London-based company that develops teller-connectivity software for financial
institutions. The software enables banks and credit unions to automate teller
functions.

NCI has made and has marketed since 1996 Teller Cash Connectivity, a suite of
software products that controls both teller cash recyclers and dispensers.

Before NCR bought NCI, De La Rue was listed on NCI's Web site as the exclusive
distributor of the software.

"This acquisition will make it easier for NCR and its banking customers around
the world to introduce and integrate branch-automation technologies that can
transform branch productivity and the customer experience," Nuti said in a
statement, noting the range of branch services includes ATMs.

Man in Black the coolest ever to walk the line

SOURCE: CanWest News Service and Knight Ridder Newspapers

BYLINE: Patrick Langston and Rick Shefchik

SECTION: News; Pg. A1 / FRONT

LENGTH: 1594 words

Johnny Cash was cool. There was something so rugged, so independent

and so original about him that even the MTV crowd recognized how cool he was,
nominating him in several categories at this year's video awards.

Weakened by a variety of ailments over the past several years, Cash died at
Baptist Hospital in Nashville Friday morning from complications due to diabetes.

His passing brought to an end not only five decades of writing and recording
some of the best (and a couple of the worst) songs in country music, but also a
life that at times approached mythic proportions, at least in fans' minds, as
the gravelly voiced singer struggled with sin and redemption, love and loss,
desire and satiation both on and off the stage.

How cool was he? As a 23-year-old bass-voiced country newcomer, he was invited
to jam with Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins at the Sun Records
studio in Memphis, Tenn. The one-time grouping would later be referred to as the
Million Dollar Quartet.

How cool was he? On his second single, the haunting Folsom Prison Blues, he
anticipated gangsta rap by four decades when he sang the immortal line, "I shot
a man in Reno just to watch him die."

How cool was he? He invented the concept of "crossover," taking huge country
hits like I Walk the Line and Ring of Fire from the country-western charts to
the pop charts.

How cool was he? By the '60s he became known as "The Man in Black" due to his
trademark black outfits.

He was the first pop singer to understand the aggressively neutral and vaguely
sinister message conveyed by wearing black on stage, and to this day that look
is emulated.

How cool was he? Cool enough to undercut his outlaw image by singing duets with
wife June Carter Cash on songs like Jackson and If I Were a Carpenter. It was a
groundbreaking career move; subsequent tours featured any number of Cash
relatives and in-laws on stage. Two became stars: daughter Roseanne Cash and
stepdaughter Carlene Carter.

How cool was he? Cool enough to embrace musical shifts that seemed on the
surface to be undercutting his own country-western base. When protest music
drove country artists like Merle Haggard to the right, Cash recorded with Bob
Dylan.

How cool was he? When drugs were at their peak of music-industry glamour, Cash
managed -- with stops at both Hazelden and the Betty Ford Clinic -- to quit a
lengthy habit.

How cool was he? When law-and-order was the order of the day, Cash performed for
prisoners at San Quentin and other high-security lockups.

When the music industry went one way, Cash almost always went the other way --
his way. Of all the artists who came and went during his five professional
decades, Cash was one of the very few who never seemed to be holding a wetted
finger up to the wind to determine how best to further his career.

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine. I keep my eyes wide open all the
time. I keep the ends out for the tie that binds. Because you're mine, I walk
the line. (I Walk the Line by Johnny Cash)

Cash was a less complex figure when he arrived on the musical scene, one of the
promising young men, along with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and Perkins, in Sam
Phillips' Sun Records stable back in 1955. Backed by the Tennessee Two --
guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant -- Cash zipped up the charts
with Cry, Cry, Cry, I Walk the Line, and, presaging his lifelong empathy for the
marginalized and his flair for writing lyrics of classical simplicity, Folsom
Prison Blues.

Those early songs, neither entirely rockabilly nor country, a little folkie and
a little bluesy, became the model for almost everything Cash did later. Stripped
down and utterly distinctive, they were underpinned by the famous
boom-chicka-boom rhythm that, regular and primal as a heartbeat, recalls the
clickety-clack of trains.

Cash's voice, part dry-land farmer, part Old Testament prophet, emerges from and
absolutely dominates the austere musical accompaniment. With little of consuming
instrumental interest in his songs, the listener is forced back again and again
to Cash's vocals, which seem forged from his hardscrabble background: picking
350 pounds of cotton a day as the child of an Arkansas sharecropper; a brief
stint on an automobile assembly line; four years in the Air Force, where he
learned to play guitar; a failed career as a newly married appliance salesman in
Memphis before finally auditioning at Sun Records.

Craggy, rough-hewn and limited in range, Cash's voice is ideally suited to the
unadorned lyrics of his songs, says Michael Streissguth, editor of Ring of Fire:
The Johnny Cash Reader. "The voice juts out from the landscape. It's a perfect
partner with (early Cash hits) Big River and Five Feet High and Rising. Do you
want Elvis singing Big River? In fact, Cash calls himself a stylist, and fans
accepted it wasn't the best voice, but it was part of the package, like Dylan."

By 1958, the year Cash left Sun Records for a 28-year run with Columbia Records,
that voice had carved out a seemingly permanent home on the country and pop
charts with hits like Ballad of a Teenage Queen (his biggest selling single
ever), Guess Things Happen That Way, and others. Cash had a upward trajectory of
hits with I Still Miss Someone, Don't Take Your Guns to Town and, in 1963, the
blockbuster Ring of Fire, written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore at a time
when Carter met and fell for the still-married Cash.

He also released a series of albums chronicling the American experience,
including Bitter Tears, with its controversial single The Ballad of Ira Hayes,
Peter LaFarge's song about the tragic downfall of a Native American.

Exhausted by a rigorous touring schedule, Cash began popping uppers in 1959 and
quickly became addicted. He spent much of the 1960s in a fog, receiving a
suspended jail sentence for trying to smuggle amphetamines across the Mexican
border, getting booted from the Grand Ole Opry for kicking out the footlights,
and nearly dying from a drug overdose.

It was June Carter who pulled Cash out of his drug habit in 1967, in part by
reconverting him to the fundamentalist Christianity he'd been raised on. That
was the beginning of Cash's second coming.

I hear the train a comin'; it's rollin"round the bend. And I ain't seen the
sunshine since I don't know when. I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps
draggin' on. (Folsom Prison by Johnny Cash)

In 1967, the recently divorced Cash proposed to the twice-divorced Carter on
stage in London, Ont., and they were married the next year, he bringing four
daughters and she two to the union. Their son, John Carter Cash, was born two
years later.

In 1968, Cash also recorded one of his career highlights, the live album Johnny
Cash at Folsom Prison and, the next year, Live at San Quentin.

"The guards were scared to death," Cash later said of the San Quentin show. "All
the convicts were standing up on the dining tables -- all I would have had to do
was say 'Break!' and they were gone, man."

The success of the two prison albums, especially San Quentin, which spun off the
Grammy-winning single A Boy Named Sue, helped propel Cash onto network
television (Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart, from the Folsom Prison
album, had less impact). The Johnny Cash Show ran weekly from 1969 to 1971, with
Cash's taste in guests -- from Bob Dylan to the Who -- both eclectic and
informed.

Cash held his own through most of the 1970s, touring relentlessly and recording
hits like Oney and One Piece at a Time, both about blue-collar settling of
accounts with overlords. He chummed with Billy Graham, played for President
Richard Nixon at the White House, and then confounded everybody by stating, in a
1973 interview, "As far as the war in Vietnam is concerned, that war just made
me sick." He also got involved in benefit work on behalf of prisoners and Native
Americans.

By the 1980s, Cash was slipping off the charts, a victim of "The Urban Cowboy
craze and all that," he told music writer Nick Tosches in the mid-1990s. "So I
kind of pulled back -- and forgot about tryin' to make really good records
because nobody was really interested in 'em."

Revitalized in the late 1960s, Johnny Cash did it again in the mid-1990s with
the American Recordings series produced by Rick Rubin. The four albums -- at
once as sombre and hopeful as anything Cash had ever done, never approached the
sales figures of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, but did enjoy substantial press
-- were generally lauded by critics and, with songs by Tom Petty, U2 and Will
Oldham among the scattering of Cash originals and traditional songs, quickly won
the hearts of young hipsters. Cash was at work on the fifth album in the
American Recordings series when he died.

"I don't see him (Cash) as a country act," said Rubin in a 1994 interview. "He's
an outlaw figure, and that is the essence of what rock 'n' roll is."

But it's not the seamed face of an aging Johnny Cash that will be remembered, an
old fellow with 80-plus records and 8,000 days on the road to his credit.
Instead, it's the broad-shouldered and trim-hipped artist of his middle years,
striding to the microphone in a black preacher's coat to say, "Hello, I'm Johnny
Cash."

"I don't see anybody poised to be such a meaningful figure in country music or
anybody embodying the human experience and articulating the American experience
the way Cash did," says Streissguth. "He had foibles and was public about them
and dealt with them. I think we saw our hope, our promise for redemption, in
him."

CASH-ON-CASH TAKES COMPANIES' MEASURE

BYLINE: BARRIE DUNSTAN

SECTION: INVESTMENT; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 614 words


A month or so ago, the London Financial Times reported on the valuation
techniques of Wall Street's top-performing money managers, Brean Murray, Foster
Securities.

The Melbourne private company consultants Somers Exell Pty Ltd smiled and went
back to check its research figures - because the technique which the Wall Street
managers were using to boost their performance was the so-called cash-on-cash
approach,

a system Somers Exell has used for years.

The Somers Exell group, run by Bill Somers and Steve Exell, has used the cash
-on-cash approach, rather than some version of the price/earnings multiple, for
years to value private companies.

As Steve Exell says, the capitalisation-of-earnings approach to valuation can be
traced back to a 1948 court precedent which has become acceptable practice in
the subsequent 40 years.

This traditional approach, which flows over into expert valuations of companies
for takeover offers, takes an earnings-a-share figure and multiplies it by some
price/earnings ratio or capitalisation figure to produce a neat, precise figure.

But that neat figure is based on an earnings-per-share figure (which can be
subject to all sorts of outside factors) and a price/earnings ratio which also
is subject to gigantic assumptions.

As this column has recently noted, the question of earnings-per-share
measurement can sometimes become a ratio which is subject to varying
measurements and standards.

Somers Exell is very active in the field of private companies but, Steve Exell
says, the firm does not want to get involved in arguments in court where it
tries to justify its valuations.

The cash-on-cash return measures the cash return on trading, divided by the
total cash investment required to buy the company or business.

The formula for a private company is profit before interest and tax, plus
non-tax items divided by net tangible assets plus goodwill plus debt, minus
cash. For public companies, market capitalisation is substituted for net
tangible assets and goodwill.

The cash-on-cash measurement assumes an investor buys an entire business to get
a cash return on his investment, just as a businessman would.

Steve Exell says cash-on-cash return is a far more reliable measure than using
price/earnings ratios because it uses unadulterated figures to measure
performance.

This approach contrasts with the traditional approach of capitalising earnings,
which depends on a gigantic assumption - the price/earnings ratio -to make it
work.

Somers Exell was surprised to discover recently that the top-performing manager
in the March quarter in New York, Brean Murray, was using basically the same
approach as its cash-on-cash measurement.

The New York managers had produced a result of plus 27.4 per cent to out-perform
the S&P 500 which rose less than 1 per cent, basically relying on a research
approach based on the cash-on-cash measure.

The advantage of the measure, as Somers Exell and the New York firm have found,
is that it takes into account the varying levels of debt in a company in the
valuation process.

Steve Exell says there are limitations on using the cash-on-cash approach. One
is where interest and debt are the main stock in trade; another is where the
main business play is the tax system.

The obvious question is how the cash-on-cash approach can be applied to
Australian public companies - in the hope that it provides superior investment
performance - as distinct from its use in the private company field.

Somers Exell has an index of cash-on-cash performance of public companies under
way which will be a useful guide, and the first index details should be
available in November after all public companies have reported their 1987-88
results.

Companies hoard cash in reaction to crisis

STUNG by the financial crisis, companies are holding more cash -- and a greater
percentage of assets in cash -- than at any time in the past 40 years.

In the second quarter, the 500 largest non-financial US firms, by total assets,
held about $US994billion ($1 trillion) in cash and short-term investments, or
9.8 per cent of their assets, according a Wall Street Journal analysis of
corporate filings. That was up from $US846bn, or 7.9 per cent of assets, a year
earlier.

The trend continued in the third quarter despite an improving economy. Of those
500 companies, 248 have reported third-quarter results.

Their cash increased to 11.1 per cent of assets from 10.1 per cent in the second
quarter. Companies as diverse as Alcoa, Google, PepsiCo and Texas Instruments
all reported big third-quarter increases in cash holdings.

``Everyone is hoarding cash,'' Citigroup financial strategy group heda Carsten
Stendevad said. He and others call that a hangover from the financial crisis of
a year ago, when companies could not raise money or had to pay higher rates than
usual.

Large cash balances are both a curse for the economy and a potential blessing.
Hoarding means companies are spending and investing less, damping economic
growth. But that leaves them with more cash to deploy as the economy improves,
giving them a freer hand to acquire, and to restart hiring and capital spending.

Large cash balances are ``great news for the macroeconomy,'' said Mr Stendevad.
``A lot of firms now are in a position ... to start reinvesting again, and that
ultimately is what is gong to drive employment.''

In response to last year's financial crisis, executives bolstered rainy-day
funds to ensure they could cover day-to-day operations.

Aggressive cost-cutting and a boom in debt issuance also have swelled cash
balances. Many companies have no plans for the cash, beyond peace of mind.
``They'd have to beat me over my head to get it out of my hands,'' Alcoa chief
financial officer Charles McLane said.

The aluminum maker reported holding $US1.1bn in cash and cash equivalents on
September 30, up 28 per cent from a year earlier. As revenue slumped this year,
Alcoa cut its dividend, its spending and more than 15,000 jobs to save cash.

Alcoa posted a profit in the third quarter, but Mr McLane remained cautious.
``We're just going to be extremely prudent'' about managing cash, he said.

Some companies are considering targeted spending or acquisitions. Semiconductor
maker Texas Instruments this year has acquired two small companies, plus
equipment from a bankrupt competitor.

TI reported $US2.8bn in cash and short-term investments as of September 30, up
42 per cent from a year earlier.

Chief financial officer Kevin March said executives decided a year ago to amass
cash so they could seize opportunities to buy cheap manufacturing capacity,
technology and other assets.

Now, he said, TI could ``move very quickly'' on deals while maintaining strong
reserves.

Rene Stulz, a finance professor at Ohio State University's business school, said
companies increased cash holdings as globalisation and technological change
exposed them to more risk.

``Firms are riskier than they used to be, so they need a bigger security
blanket,'' he said. They were holding more of their assets in cash than at any
time since the 1960s, when payment automation reduced the need to hold cash for
daily operations, he said.

Kathleen Kahle, a professor at the University of Georgia's business school,
offered another reason: the growth of hi-tech companies, which tended to hold
lots of cash. Younger, riskier firms have more difficulty raising money when
credit is tight, so they keep more cash on hand, she said.

``At the same time, they have a lot of growth opportunities and want to make
sure that they have the funds necessary to invest in good projects,'' she said.

At the end of the second quarter, the 54 biggest information technology firms
held $US280bn -- or 27 per cent of their assets -- in cash, according to the
Journal's analysis, a higher percentage than any other industry group.

Consider Google. The search giant's cash and short-term investments rose 53 per
cent to $US22bn in the third quarter from a year earlier, accounting for 58 per
cent of its total assets.

The cash provides ``operating and strategic flexibility'', Google chief
executive Eric Schmidt said. ``We're very happy to have it sit in our bank
account and earn a modest interest rate.''

The cash hoarding trend reversed for a few years earlier this decade, as
activist investors and hedge funds pressed companies to put cash to use.

Private equity firms turned cash-flush companies into takeover targets, using
the cash to repay acquisition debt. By the first quarter of last year, cash
assets had fallen to 7.9 per cent.

Then came the credit crisis. Unable to raise money in the bond markets or issue
short-term debt known as commercial paper, companies began slashing expenses and
stockpiling cash.

In the fourth quarter of last year, cash holdings of the 500 largest companies
jumped by $US46bn, or 5 per cent, to $US886bn.

Their cash balances increased by another 12 per cent in the first half of this
year, to $US994bn.

As investors regained an appetite for corporate debt last northern spring,
companies rushed to take advantage. Companies in the S&P 500 have issued
$US548bn in corporate bonds this year, up from $US403bn a year earlier,
according to data provider Dealogic. Some of that cash is now idle on balance
sheets.

NCR Set to Make Move into Cash Handler/Recycler Field.

NCR Corp. plans to offer cash-handling and cash-recycling machines, a market
that is taking off as the U.S. automated teller machine market is maturing.

Bill Nuti, NCR's chairman and chief executive officer, said its expertise in
making ATMs will help it expand quickly in the adjacent space.

"It's in our wheelhouse. We will be No. 1 in this market," Mr. Nuti said during
a meeting with analysts last month.

Cash-recycling and cash-handling machines are used in branches to count and
dispense bank notes and coins, and some banks say they can reduce employee
turnover.

NCR's top rivals in the ATM market, Diebold Inc. and Wincor Nixdorf AG, already
offer cash-recycling and cash-handling systems to banks.

Lee Manfred, a partner with First Annapolis Consulting Inc.in Linthicum, Md.,
said NCR is responding to slower growth and increased competition for its core
ATM business. "The ATM markets are maturing in the U.S., and NCR is leveraging
its knowledge of ATM technology to enter another vertical market," he said.

Nicole Sturgill, a research director for delivery systems at TowerGroup Inc. in
Needham, Mass., an independent research firm owned byMasterCard Inc., said the
machines are a logical next step for NCR. "NCR doesn't have to reinvent the
wheel" to enter this market, she said.

Cash-recycling and cash-handling systems have "passed the proof-of-concept stage
with banks," Ms Sturgill said.

She projects thatover the next four years U.S. banks will spend $8.4 billion
automating their branches, and 7% to 10% of that amount will go toward
teller-assist units, such as cashhandlers and cash recyclers.

Banks install cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines at teller stations;
recyclers accept notes and coins that customers deposit, and handlers (sometimes
called dispensers) can dispense cash to tellers or customers. Both automatically
track the incoming and outgoing funds.

Banks consider both machines keys to reducing expenses because they help cut
turnover. Banks often must terminate tellers who cannot provide an accurate
count of deposits, Ms. Sturgill said.

"Cash-recycling machines eliminate the need for several tellers to check each
other's count for accuracy," she said.

Cash-recycling and cash-dispensing machines also give banks an accurate count of
the types of bank notes they dispense to customers.

"The bank may think it dispenses X amount of tens, fives, twenties, and
hundreds, but a cash-dispensing machine may show something different, which
would reduce the amount of the cash a branch needs," Ms. Sturgill said.

NCR will also be taking on a partner, Talaris Ltd. (formerly De La Rue Cash
Systems), the industry leader in banknotecounting, banknoterecycling, and
coincounting, the analysts said.

Talaris manufactures desktop cash-handling products and ATM technology for
original-equipment manufacturers, and it supplies some internal mechanisms for
NCR teller machines.

NCR, of Dayton, Ohio, signaled its intent to move into the cash-recycling, cash
-handling, and coin-counting markets in August when it purchased NCI Ltd., a
London company that develops teller-connectivity software that enables banks and
credit unions to automate teller functions.

Before NCR bought NCI, Talaris was listed on NCI's Web site as the exclusive
distributor of the software.

The purchase makes it easier for NCR and its bank customers "to introduce and
integrate branch-automation technologies," Mr. Nuti said then.

Cash flow follies: Groupon vs. Facebook;
Facebook wins praise for avoiding 'make-believe' metrics, but Groupon doesn't
fare so well under Grumpy Old Accountants' scrutiny

BYLINE: DAVID MILSTEAD

Investing, Warren Buffett says, is easy: Just add up all the future cash flows
of a business, discount them to the present day, and pay less than that number.

Set aside, for the moment, that those future cash flows are somewhere between
estimate and guesstimate. Sometimes, the problem for investors is figuring out
just what cash flow number to use.

For examples, we turn to two of the buzziest Internet companies today: Groupon
Inc., which just reported its first quarterly results as a public company, and
Facebook Inc., which tantalized investors this month with its initial public
offering filing.

First, let's talk about the cash flow statement. Operating cash flow takes the
company's net income and adds back non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, to
arrive at a number for how much cash the company generated from its operating
business.

The number is distinct from investing cash flow, which records cash spent on
things like property, plant and equipment, and financing cash flow, which
considers, for example, what the company borrows or the debt it pays off.

The cash flow statement is (or should be) created per generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States, or International Financial
Reporting Standards in Canada. (IFRS allows companies discretion as to where
they put their interest payments, meaning that operating cash flow at a Canadian
company may not be directly comparable with a U.S. company. That is a topic for
another day.)

Operating cash flow is not the end of the story, however. Analysts and companies
recognize that continuing capital expenditures - the purchases of plant property
and equipment - are necessary to generate operating cash. So, the number that
emerges is often called "free cash flow" - typically, but not universally,
defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Why is it not
universal? There's no explicit definition for "free cash flow" in the accounting
standards.

Now, we turn to Facebook. Two professors who run the Grumpy Old Accountants blog
give the company an "A" grade for its financial reporting. They laud Facebook
for not using EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, anywhere in its statements.

More narrowly, but also importantly, they also credit Facebook for its
definition of free cash flow: From operating cash flow, the company subtracts
not only purchases of capital equipment, but also payments on leases used to
acquire it.

Facebook says it made the choice "because we believe that these two items
collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure
to support our business, regardless of whether we finance such property or
equipment with a capital lease."

Say the Grumpy Old Accountants, Anthony H. Catanach Jr. and J. Edward Ketz:
"Yes, this is a small thing, but it suggests that the company values good
numbers, not 'make-believe' metrics."

"Make believe," like what? Well, like some of the measures Groupon has tried to
use. (This is VOX's third shot at Groupon, and perhaps its last, but I cannot
promise.)

Groupon initially tried to make up its own "consolidated segment operating
income" metric that left out all sorts of real expenses. The Wall Street Journal
reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took issue with this
approach, and Groupon removed it from its IPO filing.

Groupon seems to be getting more rigorous, as evidenced by its earnings release
last week that highlighted free cash flow. And indeed, Groupon calculated it in
a traditional way, subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow.
But the Grumpy Old Accountants, in an interview with CFO magazine, made another
valid criticism of Groupon's financial reporting.

The company's business model, where it sells online coupons and eventually
passes the proceeds on to its merchant partners, offers great room to stretch
out payment times and improve operating cash flow. That's because part of the
measure includes the changes in a company's payables and receivables - so a
company that takes longer to cover its bills can, appropriately, report a better
cash flow number than a company that pays faster.

Since Groupon didn't provide the entire cash flow statement with its earnings
release, Mr. Catanach said, it's difficult to determine whether vendor-payment
policies contributed to its increases in free cash flow. Groupon chief financial
officer Jason Child responded to the comments by telling CFO magazine the
suggestion was untrue and "silly," and that providing a full cash flow statement
would not give investors "any additional information."

Untrue, perhaps, but not silly, since Groupon didn't produce the cash-flow
statement that would have quashed such concerns. It was, indeed, "additional
information" - information that is deeply important for investors to unravel the
mysteries of cash flow.

Middle-Market Cash Management An Overlooked Revenue Source

                           February 22, 2002, Friday

BY SANDRA BOSS and CARSTEN STENDEVAD



Cash management accounts for about one third of North American commercial banks'
economic profit from the midmarket, and most midmarket CFOs say cash management
is integral to their banking relationships.

But many leading commercial banks pay surprisingly little attention to midmarket
customers' cash management needs. The result is that many customers are not
impressed by what they are getting from their banks, and the only thing keeping
them from seeking alternatives is the fear of administrative hassles.

Recently, a few banks have begun to pay attention to the midmarket's needs.
These banks are now rolling up midmarket banking profits and making it
worthwhile for some customers to make the switch. The days of taking midmarket
cash management for granted may finally be over.

IT'S WHERE THE CASH IS ...

The midmarket matters now more than ever, because large corporate customers have
squeezed much of the profit out of the high end of the cash management market.
Large companies expect extraordinary functionality from banks in exchange for
razor-thin fees; they also aggressively minimize deposit balances.

In contrast, busy midmarket financial managers leave much more money on the
table for their banks. They require very basic functionality, and they keep most
of their excess cash on the bank's balance sheet. If they use sweeps, they sweep
to the bank's proprietary money market funds. They are not focused on price:
research shows that quality of service, their relationship with their
relationship manager, and availability of credit are all more important to them
in choosing a bank.

Furthermore, nearly all midmarket companies use cash management. McKinsey's
research found that cash management is at least as important as credit for the
majority of them, and the most important product for 20%. Many of these
companies are service companies with high transaction volumes (such as
insurance, advertising, and some professional services). These cash-oriented
companies use some credit and other products, but they base their choice of lead
bank on cash management capabilities.

... BUT MANY BANKS IGNORE IT

Banks' reasons for overlooking cash management vary. Some banks are still
leading with lending, traditionally the fastest way to grow revenues and
earnings. The recession has not altered this fundamental strategy, though banks
have tightened credit as losses mount.

The majority of banks want to complement lending with fee income, but they are
focused on big-ticket investment banking and asset management rather than on the
lower fees of cash management.

A few banks have erected daunting organizational and financial barriers between
midmarket relationship banking and cash management product groups. They see cash
management as a purely operational product that does not really require a
relationship. In the extreme, the midmarket relationship banker does not even
know his client's cash management revenues or deposit balances.

This bias against cash management is often reinforced by relationship managers.
Most bankers began their careers as loan officers and developed only a
smattering of knowledge of other products. Now new product training emphasizes
investment banking and asset management, not cash management.

Further, many bankers consider cash management beneath their dignity. They worry
that promoting an operational product like cash management would lower their
stature with the CEOs and CFOs to whom they are trying to sell investment
banking.

Finally, they have no real incentives for promoting cash management versus
easier to sell or more glamorous products. It is not surprising that most
bankers discuss cash management strategy with their midmarket clients once a
year or less.

INERTIA IS HARD TO CHANGE

Midmarket CFOs have let banks get away with this, even though cash management is
important to their businesses. The typical midmarket CFO is not even sure
whether his company is satisfied with its current cash management provider:
though CFOs control the provider decision, they may not even know about current
functionality gaps or service issues, because they rarely ask the financial
operations personnel who handle cash management day-to-day for their point of
view.

And when CFOs do consider switching cash-management providers, they have to make
an uncomfortable leap of faith when it comes to promised benefits. Providers
tend to sound very similar during the sales process, even to the operations
team, and a trial is impossible.

The subtle differences in functionality that divide the great from the average
providers -- such as how close to real-time balance information is available, or
whether data transfer is really fully automated -- tend to reveal themselves
only after the new system goes live. As long as such real benefits to switching
feel elusive, the specter of administrative hassle is omnipresent. Even the most
proficient, agreeable operations team will belabor the transition problems
caused by an inept provider.

WHAT'S THE SECRET?

A few banks have seized the opportunity provided by the importance of cash
management to the midmarket and have been convincing enough that CFOs are taking
the leap.

These cash management consolidators have revolutionized relationship coverage to
reach and serve more effectively the midmarket customers who really value cash
management.

Why make a lender responsible for a customer who is flush with excess cash? A
relationship banker with treasury management skills can really connect with the
customer and add a credit expert if lending needs arise.

Why let relationship bankers ignore small customers with limited lending or
investment banking potential? A knowledgeable local service group can handle
routine cash management inquiries promptly and competently, as well as promote
additional products.

Why make cash management product specialists wait around for leads? Research
teams can identify and qualify prospects much more efficiently than generalist
relationship bankers. The best banks complement such new coverage models with
incentives for all customer-facing groups to broaden and deepen the cash
management franchise.

The most aggressive banks are also willing to give some deposit-related profits
back to midmarket customers, thus making the benefits of switching more
tangible.

No bank is eager to see a widespread use of sweeps in the midmarket, but some
are selectively introducing more sophisticated cash concentration and investment
products to the most attractive midmarket prospects. They have also tiered
deposit pricing to increase yield for midmarket customers who keep large
balances while protecting their deposit income from smaller, less sophisticated
midmarket customers.

Finally, if administrative hassles are the most frequent barrier to switching,
why not eliminate or minimize them? The cash management consolidators have
adapted high-end transition approaches for the midmarket and streamlined their
switching procedures. For example, they have simplified and automated the
process for notifying suppliers and customers of new bank routing information.

Where standard routines cannot help (for example, integration between bank
systems and customer proprietary or third-party accounting software), they have
created transition teams that minimize customer pain. The banks that have made
these transitions easier report improved sales effectiveness and more customer
satisfaction both during and after conversion.

The cash management consolidators are already generating more than half of their
midmarket revenues from cash management, versus about a third for other banks.
In some regions, one lead bank already controls cash management, while the other
bank is stuck with all the credit.

For many banks, midmarket cash management is no longer easy money. Those who
invest in superior cash management now will be able to capture increased revenue
from this important source.

Why some practices stopped accepting patients' cash

HIGHLIGHT: American Medical News: views and opinions on issues in medical
practice


Sacramento Ear, Nose & Throat in California has a message for its patients: Your
cash is no good here.

A couple of years ago, the 19-physician otolaryngology practice stopped
accepting cash payments from patients. No singles, tens, twenties, pennies,
dimes or quarters -- no matter how shiny or crisp. Instead, official policy is
that patients pay only with a credit or debit card, or by check.

It's a policy that patients have come to accept. In fact, patients drove the
policy in the first place, said practice CEO Jeffrey Dudley.

"Most people don't carry a lot of cash anymore. Cash is no longer king," he
said.

According to a survey of 3,210 consumers that Javelin Strategy & Research
completed in October 2011, 54% used a credit or debit card most frequently to
pay for goods or services, and only 21% relied on cash. The use of cash was more
common among people over 65 than those 18 to 24 years old.

Trend data are not available, but industry watchers say the numbers indicate
that cash is no longer the preferred method of payment.

Few practices seem to have gone so far as to exclude cash payments, but those
that have cite many reasons for doing so. Eliminating cash reduces the risk of
embezzlement if a staffer takes $10 here and there over a period of time. "Cash
has legs," Dudley said. "Cash is pretty easy to slip into your pocket. We wanted
to eliminate the temptation."

Practices said cash is much more difficult to manage, and the 2% to 3% fee for
each credit-card transaction is more than covered by the reduction in costs for
managing cash -- such as transporting it to the bank.

For these reasons and others, the practice of allergy and asthma specialist
Sudhir Prabhu, MD, went cashless about six months ago. Family Allergy & Asthma
Consultants, which has four offices in and around Jacksonville, Fla., already
was seeing a majority of its patients paying with plastic.

The coordination needed to manage the cash that did come in and always being
able to provide change left Dr. Prabhu asking if this form of payment was worth
the effort.

"When you take cash, you have to have a lot of safeguards in place," he said.
"We have multiple locations and one bank. It just became logistically difficult
to collect money from all the locations."

Those who counsel practices on money matters advise considering several issues
when thinking about forgoing cash.

"It depends on the situation," said Jeffrey Milburn, an independent health care
consultant with the Medical Group Management Assn. "Some of the issues to
consider are the type of the practice, the daily volume and the specialty.
Accepting cash is a convenience for the patient, and some people don't have
credit or debit cards or checking accounts. Or even if they have credit cards,
they have maxed them out. I don't think we are a cashless society yet."

Questions to consider before eliminating cash payments:

     ·     How does the patient population prefer to pay?
     ·     Do patients have noncash means with which to pay, and will they use
          them?
     ·     What is the usual amount that patients have to pay?


Practices with a large number of low-dollar transactions may find it worthwhile
to accept cash, analysts said. Those that tend to have higher patient payments
may find that a cash option is not important.

Oak Tree Internal Medicine in San Ramon, Calif., accepts cash, along with
plastic, checks and money orders, because it has many patients with $5 and $10
co-pays. Most weeks, the office collects fewer than $200 in cash from patients,
and the chance that this money will not end up where it is supposed to is low
because it is a very small office with one physician and three staffers.

"It's not likely in the near future that we would stop accepting cash," said
office manager Karen Pratt. "We try to make things as easy as possible for our
patients. I think patients really appreciate being able to pay with the method
they want to be able to pay with."

If a practice does decide to go cash-free, experts advise publicizing the new
policy as widely as possible on various information materials. Legally, medical
practices can stipulate the form of payment accepted.

Practices may want to consider some flexibility in enforcing a no-cash policy.

Sacramento Ear, Nose & Throat will accept cash, even though the official policy
says it doesn't. The practice provides a small number of cosmetic procedures and
has found that some patients who receive them prefer to pay cash.

"We're not going to turn it down, but we do make sure it gets off the front desk
to the business office," Dudley said. "We really don't ask for cash, but we're
not going to not accept cash."

Cash is king for fallen angels;
Tech Focus

A major divide in fortunes has emerged in the last quarter between the cash
earners and burners in the listed technology sector, according to an analysis of
cash-flow statements by Commonwealth Securities.

ComSec, which studied the cash-flow statements of 45 of its ComSec IT 100 Index
companies, found that cash generators stormed ahead with both higher market
capitalisations and better share price performances than their cash-consuming
counterparts.

The average market cap of cash generators was $32.4 million compared with the
cash burners on $8.2 million, ComSec found.

This illustrated that solid products, services and cash flow had now fully
superseded the blue-sky potential that once sat at the top of investor wish
lists, said ComSec analyst Mr Ross Macmillan.

"The market cap of most of the cash burners is now under $10million and we are
likely to see these share prices decline even further in the next six months if
they keep burning cash," Mr Macmillan said.

The ComSec IT 100 Index comprises 100 of the larger pure-technology companies.
Of these, 45 were required to report cash flows quarterly and 36 were still on
negative operating cash flows at the end of June, Mr Macmillan said.

"Those companies will eventually find it virtually impossible to raise cash on
the sharemarket and very difficult to get further credit from bankers," he said.

In the meantime, acquisitions and collapses would continue apace as companies
found it increasingly difficult to attract willing backers.

Yet to date, a number of companies which have hovered on the cash-flow breadline
for several consecutive quarters continue to survive, though analysts say many
are on borrowed time.

A common strategy of such companies was to slash operations and lie low in a bid
to wait out the technology recession.

"It is a case of going into hibernation now for a lot of these companies" Mr
Macmillan said.

Some, however, like IT&e Ltd, which has had several quarters of negative cash
flow, are still hoping to stage a recovery in the short term.

IT&e has said it is headed for a turnaround next quarter following a significant
restructure in which it exited its distribution, enterprise solutions and
Microarts businesses as well as its stake in Asia Online.

The company says it returned to profitability at the EBITDA level in the June
quarter and as a result its financial controller, Mr Matthew Brown, is
predicting that it will become cash-flow positive in the September quarter.

To help it on its journey to recovery IT&e also renewed an ANZ facility for up
to $60,000 a month and completed a $1.6 million capital raising, Mr Brown said.

Mr Simon Guiliano, an analyst with InvestorWeb, noted that while many surviving
cash burners were defying the odds, the longer the cash outflow exceeded the
inflow, the less appealing to investors it became.

In addition to cash-flow concerns, he said, certain business models, such as
those that relied on advertising revenue, were now coming under deeper scrutiny.

POS Media Online Ltd, an electronic media company for which advertising
comprises the primary revenue source, has felt the brunt of this.

It has twice deferred a planned rights issue as a direct result of the negative
market environment and has ended three consecutive quarters with negative cash
reserves.

Perhaps even more damning, each quarter POS Media has failed to achieve the
recovery it had previously predicted.

"Our biggest problem has been on media sales performance," said chief executive
Mr Peter Aynsley, who said POS Media had first tried to address this by bringing
the function in-house. By March, however, media sales had been outsourced again.

POS Media also slashed costs and has succeeded in raising funds through a series
of private placements, which Mr Aynsley said were sufficient to retire some debt
and fund operations for now.

The company has since told the market that its new media sales company, Ambient
Media, has strong sales prospects, with sales to be booked over the next two
months expected to leave it cash flow-positive in fourth-quarter 2001.

InvestorWeb's recent analysis of the June cash-flow statements of 198 companies
found that like IT&e and POS Media, around eight companies were relying solely
on credit facilities or overdrafts at the end of June.

In addition, it found that 33 companies did not receive a cent in cash for the
quarter, though some of these were biotechnology companies.

InvestorWeb said that while the number of companies reporting negative cash
flows had fallen from previous quarters, and the size of the losses had also
dropped, the figures were nevertheless disturbing.
