energy company, for a purchase consideration of US$15m. The Westinghouse Plasma
Gasifier will turn municipal waste into vitrified slag output that BGE will then
convert to block foam insulation to be sold at a premium, with electrical power
generation as an added benefit of the process.

Jeffery Hu, principal at BGE, said, "We are very excited to be kicking-off our
first project in China which we believe provides the best-in-class waste
management solution with better environmental performance compared to other
alternatives. In addition to the Bijie project, BGE has additional projects in
China which it also continues to advance. This project will also provide a
testing platform for clean coal applications. We believe that the Westinghouse
Plasma Gasification Technology will play a significant role in China Clean Coal
Applications."

Walter Howard, CEO of Alter NRG, said, Having a simultaneous second large-scale
project commencing is a significant commercial milestone as it will provide
additional cash flow for 2014. This illustrates the viability of our
market-leading Westinghouse Plasma Technology in other jurisdictions and the
large pipeline of projects that continue to advance around the world."

He overcame his disability to become award-winning CEO

BYLINE: By Anna Marie Kukec Staff Writer

SECTION: BIZ LEDGER; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 352 words


As a child, Michael Alter said he was a struggling student, due to dyslexia. His
third grade teacher even told his parents that "not every boy will go to
Harvard" and "the world needs more garbage men." His parents waited until Alter
was in college before they revealed that to him.

Yet with a loving family behind him, Alter overcame his learning disability and
earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University -- and a
MBA from Harvard University. "I had good support from my parents and a good
sense of myself and who I am," he said.

Now, he's president and CEO of SurePayroll and recently won CEO of the Year from
the Illinois Technology Association's 13th annual CityLights Awards. He's
actually been nominated for that award a number of times.

"I'm like the Susan Lucci of the tech world," he joked about the "All My
Children" soap star who was nominated several times before finally winning an
Emmy.

Alter is co-founder of SurePayroll and has grown the company from a startup with
about 10 employees in 2000 to a nationally recognized payroll firm with more
than 35,000 small business customers, processing as much as $12 billion in
payroll payments annually.

In February 2011, SurePayroll was acquired by another payroll service, Paychex
Inc. So the Glencoe resident continues to work in the Glenview office but also
travels on business to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C.
Atlanta, San Diego, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, Houston, and elsewhere. He was
in New York last week speaking at a conference for women entrepreneurs.

Alter said he learned about entrepreneurship from his family, which had once
owned the Harry Alter Co., a heating and air conditioning firm founded in 1929.
Earlier in his career, he worked for IBM and at McKinsey and Co., where he was a
founder. Then he partnered with three other entrepreneurs to establish
SurePayroll.

Unlike most CEOs, who are either sent packing or resign after an acquisition,
Alter continues to lead SurePayroll under the new ownership. "As long as I enjoy
what I'm doing and continue to be challenged, I'll stay," he said.

Alter grads show loyalty at annual festival

BYLINE: DA L E H U F F M A N CO M M E N TA RY

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 503 words


This is a big weekend for Archbishop Alter High School, and those who have an
allegiance to the school's hallowed halls, and also those who like fried
chicken.

Labor Day weekend is also Alter Fest weekend each year and as many as 30,000
people are expected to attend the festival this weekend on the school grounds at
940 E. David Road.

One of the features of the annual fundraising festival is Willie's Famous
Chicken Dinner.

Sharon Smith, a volunteer who has been helping publicize Alter Fest, was kind
enough to let me know the story behind the fabled fried chicken.

"The chicken is the project of Willie Bruns, a graduate of Alter's Class of
1968," Sharon said. "Willie flies back to Dayton each year from his home in
Seattle, Washington, to prepare the chicken dinners for the festival."

She added, "Willie comes home and does this each year purely out of his love for
Alter. He has no children at Alter, but feels a strong sense of loyalty to the
school and wants to ensure that Alter is around for future students."

For his big part in shouldering the burden of providing the tasty and famous
chicken dinners each year Bruns has been inducted into the Alter Alumni Hall of
Fame.

"Alter Fest wouldn't be the same without Willie," said Bill Hausmann, who with
his wife, Martha, is co-chairing this year's festival. "People come every year
just to have his chicken. But don't expect him to be sharing his recipe. He
insists it will always remain a secret."

Alter Fest is free and open to the public and in addition to the chicken
dinners, attendees can enjoy games, riders, raffles and live entertainment.
Hours are noon to midnight today and noon to 8 p.m. Monday.

Those in the Alter community will be pleased to know that a number of Alter
students are getting recognition for being good citizens.

Pat Drake, who lives in Fairborn, is the grandmother of a 2007 Alter graduate
named Cory Drake. She sent along some interesting information.

"Cory and other students were on a senior trip to our nation's capital a few
weeks ago and attended a Washington Nationals game," Pat said. "After they
returned home there was a letter from a man named Gene McNerney who lives in
Dunkirk, Maryland, sent to the school. I just felt it is worth sharing."

Among other things, McNerney wrote: "My wife and I attended the baseball game
and found ourselves surrounded by high school students. Many were wearing
sweatshirts with 'Alter' on the front . . . Every one of the students was well
behaved, polite, considerate, and a joy to see. They enjoyed themselves and at
the same time showed consideration and respect for each other and those around
them. I was very impressed. They are a credit to their parents, their school,
their community and most of all, to themselves."

I agree with you Pat Drake. How nice it is to share news about some good kids in
our midst.

Dyslexia doesn't alter CEO's success

BYLINE: By Anna Marie Kukec, Daily Herald Business Writer akukec@dailyherald.com

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 360 words


As a child, Michael Alter said he was a struggling student, due to dyslexia. His
third grade teacher even told his parents that "not every boy will go to
Harvard" and "the world needs more garbage men." His parents waited until Alter
was in college before they revealed that to him.

Yet with a loving family behind him, Alter overcame his learning disability and
earned his bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University -- and a
MBA from Harvard University. "I had good support from my parents and a good
sense of myself and who I am," he said.

Now, he's president and CEO of and recently won CEO of the Year from the
Illinois Technology Association's 13th annual CityLights Awards. He's actually
been nominated for that award a number of times.

"I'm like the Susan Lucci of the tech world," he joked about the "All My
Children" soap star who was nominated several times before finally winning an
Emmy.

Alter is co-founder of SurePayroll and has grown the company from a startup with
about 10 employees in 2000 to a nationally recognized payroll firm with more
than 35,000 small business customers, processing as much as $12 billion in
payroll payments annually.

In February 2011, SurePayroll was acquired by another payroll service, Paychex
Inc. So the Glencoe resident continues to work in the Glenview office but also
travels on business to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C.
Atlanta, San Diego, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, Houston, and elsewhere. He was
in New York last week speaking at a conference for women entrepreneurs. He wants
to encourage others, like his family did for him.

Alter said he learned about entrepreneurship from his family, which had once
owned the Harry Alter Co., a heating and air conditioning firm founded in 1929.
Earlier in his career, he worked for IBM and at McKinsey and Co., where he was a
founder. Then he partnered with three other entrepreneurs to establish
SurePayroll.

Unlike most CEOs, who are either sent packing or resign after an acquisition,
Alter continues to lead SurePayroll under the new ownership. "As long as I enjoy
what I'm doing and continue to be challenged, I'll stay," he said.

BRUNDAGE, Stanley Brower

(October 19, 1927 - March 26, 2014) Stanley Brower Brundage, age 86, passed away
at home with his beloved family by his side, on March 26, 2014 in West Palm
Beach, FL. Born October 19, 1927 in Newark, NJ, he was the son of Alfred and
Lucy Brundage. Stanley was raised in Maplewood, NJ, graduated from Columbia High
School in 1944 and was commissioned into the U.S. Army where he served as a
cryptology specialist for the duration of the war. After completing his service,
he received his Bachelor of Science in Architecture from Yale University in
1951. He married Birdie Glanzer in 1951 and they moved to Norfolk, VA where they
shared a wonderful life raising their three children. Stanley founded the
architectural firm, Brundage Kroskin, in 1956 and continued practicing even
after he officially retired from the firm in 1989 in order to help his daughter
establish her architectural practice, Archi-Techniques, in Norfolk, VA. Stanley
had a lifelong love of animals and devoted his time and energy to protecting
them and advocating on their behalf. He served several terms as president of the
Norfolk SPCA. He was an avid boater and golfer and enjoyed many hours with
family and friends pursuing both interests. Twenty years ago, Stanley took up
painting and as in most things he attempted, he excelled at it. He loved
exploring the use of color to define and inter-relate varying sized and
configured geometrical shapes. His architecture background heavily influenced
his award winning works which were shown in several galleries. Stanley is
survived by his adoring wife of 63 years, Birdie; his dearly loved children,
Peter and Susi Brundage of Dallas, TX; Lisa and Randy Shapiro of Boca Raton, FL;
Eric and Margo Brundage of New Vernon, NJ.; his beloved grandchildren, Amy,
Lauren, Casey, William, Molly, Shane, Lori, Jared and Erica and
great-grandchildren, Ella, Cole, Laine, Chloe and Lola; and two brothers, Lyle
and Robert, nieces and nephews. The family would like to thank Hospice of Palm
Beach and Broward County for their compassionate care. In lieu of flowers,
donations may be made to hospice, a humane society or the charity of your
choosing. A memorial service for Stanley will be held on Sunday, March 30, 2014
at 10:30 AM at Beth Israel Memorial Chapel located at 11115 Jog Road, Boyton
Beach, FL.

Playoffs testing Knights;
Alter and Cleveland Benedictine to play for state title Friday.;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 463 words


KETTERING - As relatively smooth as Alter had it in the regular season, the high
school football playoffs have been anything but for the unbeaten Knights.

That was especially so in last week's clutch 25-22 comeback defeat of Kenton at
Sidney.

Alter trailed 14-10 early in the fourth quarter and led 25-14 after Chris Finke
returned a punt 40 yards for a touchdown. One of his two interceptions also set
up another score.

The Knights had to withstand Kenton's air attack (61 passes) and rally to
advance. It was one of the few times Alter trailed in the fourth quarter all
season.

"We've played some pretty good football, really, all year long," reflected Alter
coach Ed Domsitz during Monday's state-wide media conference call to promote
state championship weekend.

"In the playoffs it's been a little bit of a roller-coaster. One week we seem to
do extremely well and the next week we seem to struggle and commit some
turnovers. Certainly last Friday night it was a game filled with anxiety as well
as elation."

Alter (14-0) will play for its third state title in program history at 10 a.m.
Friday against Cleveland Benedictine (13-1) in the Division IV championship game
at Ohio State University's Ohio Stadium.

The title games return to Columbus for the first time after a 24-year run at
Stark County's Massillon and Canton.

Joining Alter in playing for state championships are Wayne (D-I) and Midwest
Athletic conference members Coldwater (D-V), Minster (D-VI) and Marion Local
(D-VII).

It marks the fourth state title appearance for Alter, all with Domsitz as head
coach and all in the last eight seasons.

The Knights fell to Steubenville 34-33 in a thrilling D-III showdown in 2006
after trailing 34-13. Alter beat Steubenville 21-6 to win the D-IV state title
in 2008 and repeated as D-IV state champs the following year with a 37-7 defeat
of Chagrin Falls.

Alter has beaten Miami Trace, Wyoming, two-time defending D-IV state champ
Clinton-Massie and Kenton during its postseason run.

Loaded with a veteran senior team, the Knights expected to be playing for a
state title.

"We'd like for kids to think at some point in their four years here at Alter
they're going to have that chance to get to the (state) semis or the finals,"
Domsitz said. "That helps the kids to come out and play football. We've got
about one-third of the boys at Alter playing football."

Alter and Cincinnati La Salle (D-II) will represent the Greater Catholic League
in the state finals.

Tickets are on sale at Alter from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the main lobby today
through Thursday. Tickets also will be available from 5-7 p.m. Thursday in the
gym lobby.

Presale tickets are $10 for everyone. All seats are reserved.

ASTRONOMICAL ODDS DON'T SCARE TRAINER

BYLINE: By STEVEN CRIST, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section D; Page 31, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 859 words

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, May 13


In 113 Kentucky Derbies, 138 starters have finished 15th or worse. Only 19 of
them had handlers with the faith, or gall, to try them back in the Preakness
Stakes. None of them won, and the only one to hit the board was General Thatcher
in 1923, who went from 16th in Louisville to second in Baltimore None of them
was trained by Happy Alter, an aptly named beam of optimism who will try to
break the streak here Saturday. Alter will run No More Flowers, who finished
15th at Churchill Downs 11 days ago, back in the Preakness.

''He's run too well against these horses before to give up now,'' said Alter,
who said his parents legally changed his first name to Happy.

Alter, who lives up to it by wearing a Panama hat, driving a Rolls-Royce and
kidding around a lot, is serious about No More Flowers. The Florida-based
trainer points to the Florida Derby on April 4. No More Flowers was beaten by
just a nose by Cryptoclearance, who came back to be a close fourth in the Derby,
and he finished four lengths in front of Bet Twice, the Derby runner-up.

Since that race, though, No More Flowers ran a bad second as the odds-on
favorite in the Derby Trial, then was beaten by 25 3/4 lengths in the Derby.

''Maybe he's heading the wrong way, but he's doing well,'' Alter said. ''I have
to give him another chance.'' Alter said his colt disliked the hard track at
Churchill Downs. The Pimlico surface is far slower than usual this year, with
more sand and cushion to the track.

Alter's stable logo is a pair of brown boxing gloves on a field of yellow. The
trainer said he was an amateur boxer and then an intimate friend of Muhammad
Ali, traveling the world to see some of his title bouts. Alter took after his
idol at Louisville, spouting rhyming doggerel about when No More Flowers would
make his winning move in the Derby. Since then, Alter has toned down his act,
but he promises to compose an extemporaneous poem if No More Flowers wins the
Preakness.

Alysheba Tops Field

The Preakness field will be drawn Thursday morning, and Jeff Weissman, the
Pimlico oddsmaker, will release the following early line if there are no changes
in the expected field: Alysheba will be listed as the 7-5 favorite, followed by
Bet Twice at 3-1, Cryptoclearance at 7-2, Gulch at 6-1, Lookinforthebigone at
12-1, Avies Copy at 15-1, Phantom Jet at 20-1 and No More Flowers and Harriman
at 30-1 each.

Wisdom of Solomone

Mickey Solomone, who picked up the mount on Avies Copy three days before the
Derby and steered the long shot to a third-place finish, does not seem to have
been overwhelmed by the experience.

''I was riding at Churchill Downs,'' Solomone said this morning after working
Avies Copy five furlongs in 1:00. ''If you are there and can ride in the Derby
or any added-money feature, you can make money if you ride.''

Avies Copy earned $50,000 for running third, and Solomone got the usual 10
percent, $5,000.

Hot Potato Dropped

Florida legislators, understandably maddened by years of trying to mediate the
annual fight over racing dates among Hialeah, Gulfstream and Calder, got even
last week. A State House committee passed a bill deregulating the thoroughbred
dates, leaving the tracks free to choose their own dates and run against one
another.

The bill, expected to be passed before the Legislature adjourns June 5, would be
effective immediately and negate the assignment of dates for next winter.
Hialeah, kicking and screaming, had been ordered to run in November and December
instead of its usual midwinter dates, which track officials forecast could mean
the demise of the historic and scenic track.

No one expects the tracks to compete against one another. There are not enough
horses to support simultaneous meetings, and not enough fans to make them
profitable. What the legislators are forcing the tracks to do is sit down
themselves, finally, and compromise on the dates. The lawmakers have thus
cleverly rid themselves of the issue. They did the same thing with the state's
dog tracks 12 years ago, and the tracks finally made peace.

Hialeah has always been the stumbling block to resolving the situation because
of its insistence on permanent possession of the best dates despite its
declining business. Now the track will be forced to soften its stand.

Race for Lady's Secret

Lady's Secret, last season's Horse of the Year but badly beaten by males in the
Donn Handicap March 7 in her only start this year, is expected to return
Saturday at Belmont in the Shuvee Handicap, carrying top weight of 126 pounds. .
. . The $115,000 Black-Eyed Susan for 3-year-old fillies here Friday drew a
field of 10, none of them among the division's leaders. Oh So Precious, second
to Devil's Bride in the Comely at Aqueduct May 2, is the likely favorite over
Grecian Flight, Ready to Rule and seven others. The best of the crop are waiting
for the Acorn at Belmont May 23. . . . Kent Desormeaux, a 17-year-old apprentice
rider, is the talk of Pimlico. He has won 80 races since Pimlico opened March
23, including six races here Tuesday and today's eighth race aboard Near East, a
10-year-old half-brother to Ruffian.

Alter looks to rebound after 2-7 start;
HIGH SCHOOL NOTES

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C4

Eric Coulter

The Alter boys high school basketball team is experiencing some growing pains.
Three starters returned from last season's surprise final four squad. But it's
who didn't return that has had the most impact.

The Knights (2-7) fell to rival Chaminade Julienne 64-59 in overtime Tuesday
night at Trent Arena - Alter's fifth straight loss.

"I told (CJ) Coach ( Joe) Staley before the game started, it's always easy being
the assistant," said first-year Alter coach Eric Coulter, who drew the
unenviable task of following Joe Petrocelli as the Knights' main man following
his retirement from coaching last spring.

"You have the best job in the world being an assistant. You can offer
suggestions and it's up to the coach to take them or not."

Juniors Michael Schwieterman, Dean Lemon and Kraig Howe are returning starters
and will be key if Alter is to jump-start its season. But missing is super guard
Jaaron Simmons, now a freshman at the University of Houston. And, of course,
"Petro."

Coulter had a couple of terms as a Knights assistant before landing the head
coach job. "Petro" was the only Alter coach in program history until retiring.
He amassed 800-plus wins.

"Following a legendary coach is very difficult; there's no doubt about it,"
Coulter said. "But the kids make it special. The place (Alter) is a special
place and hopefully we can get it turned around."

? Trotwood-Madison has dropped a Jan. 25 boys basketball game against
Middletown. Rams athletic director Guy Fogle said that was done because Trotwood
played in the Midwest Showcase last month at Indianapolis.

That nixes an intriguing matchup that apparently will play out next season. Mark
Baker, in his first season as the Middies head coach, previously was the head
coach at Trotwood.

Already at the maximum 22 regular-season games, Trotwood (8-0) chose to drop
Middletown (7-3) over other remaining non-league games against Prime Prep
(Texas) at Fl-yin' to the Hoop, Dunbar, Alter and Lakota West.

? Unbeaten Versailles (8-0) suffered an unlucky break when all-world junior Kyle
Ahrens snapped a tibia and fibula in a recent holiday tournament game against
West Liberty-Salem.

According to the Greenville Daily Advocate, the highly sought-after 6-foot-5
junior won't require surgery but isn't expected to return this season.

Just five points shy of scoring 1,000 for his career, Ahrens has multiple
scholarship offers but is uncommitted. Among the many offering are Dayton,
Xavier, Cincinnati and Michigan State. Ahrens was a key member of the Division
III state runner-up Tigers last season.

CHS grad arranging for Alter;
Nick Riley, a student at Capital University, has been working for the Knights'
band since graduation.

BYLINE: By Pamela Ferris-Olson Contributing Writer

SECTION: CENTERVILLE AND WASHINGTON TWP; Pg. RH-1

LENGTH: 494 words


KETTERING - Nick Riley knows the path between wickedness and salvation is
enhanced by the steady pulse of a percussion section.

That is what the 2007 Centerville High School graduate has arranged for the
Alter Marching Knights band to do this season with their 2008 show titled
"Salvation," with music of Bach, Stravinsky and Biebl.

Riley, a music education student at Capital University in Columbus, has been the
percussion director and arranger/composer of Alter's marching band percussion
section since he graduated from Centerville.

"A friend of mine told me that Alter had a new band director and was heading in
a much better direction than previous years. I contacted him and that day was
interviewed and hired on the spot," Riley said.

The Marching Knights, a Class A band in the Mid-States Band Association, has 16
wind and 11 percussion musicians, and four in color guard.

The band performs at football games, MSBA local and circuit competitions, and
local parades.

Working with Alter isn't treason for Riley, who was a member of Centerville's
marching band.

"CHS and Alter do compete together at marching band contests, but not directly.
CHS is in the Open Class in the Mid-States Band Association (the class with the
largest bands) and Alter is in Class A (the class with the smallest bands). It
would be very difficult for the 31-member Alter band to defeat the 196-member
Centerville Jazz Band," Riley said.

Riley showed an interest in percussion at the age of 5. He plays a range of
percussion instruments from snare drum to piano.

At Capital, Riley performs with a number of bands and prefers the concert band,
but his passion is for teaching and watching the marching band. His career goal
is to be a high school band director.

"One of my particular aspirations is to become the percussion caption head or
arranger for a drum and bugle corps (a professional marching band)," Riley said.
"Part of that dream is being realized this summer when I tour as the front
ensemble technician with the newly formed Open Class drum and bugle corps, Magic
of Mobile, from Mobile, Ala."

Riley worked with other Alter band staff, including director Todd Tucker and
Florida-based composer Tim Hinton to create the 2008 show.

They began the creative process in December and previewed the music in April.

During the summer and fall, Alter band members attend a variety of clinics and
camps to learn and perfect the show.

"The biggest challenge working with Alter is dealing with kids of all age levels
and musical backgrounds. Our youngest member is a 12-yearold seventh-grader, and
our oldest member is an 18-year-old senior," Riley said.

"Working with kids of such varied musical experience and skill is a significant
challenge to write music around and to teach. My aim is to challenge the
students with difficult music that I know that they cannot play right away and
then help them improve. As a result, we have developed a very formidable Class A
band and percussion section."

Cityfolk's new director looks to future;
Festival will happen in 2011, Kathleen Alter says, but she can't promise
anything after that.

BYLINE: By Dave Larsen Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 757 words


DAYTON - The City-folk Festival will return next year, but whether Dayton's
largest outdoor festival continues beyond 2011 remains uncertain.

"We definitely will have a festival in 2011," said Kathleen Alter, Cityfolk's
new executive director. "Beyond that I can't promise or say anything."

Alter, who assumed her new role Oct. 4, has been charged with moving Dayton's
traditional arts organization forward amid declining corporate sponsorships,
including the loss of $140,000 in annual Cityfolk Festival funding that
threatened this year's event.

"The environment is changing; we just have to find ways to change with it," said
Alter, 48, a native of Fort Wayne, Ind.

In addition to expanding membership and fundraising efforts, Cityfolk's board
and staff are considering a number of options to sustain the nonprofit folk arts
presenter, Alter said.

Those steps could include Cityfolk booking shows in other markets beyond Dayton;
broadening the types of music it offers within the folk tradition; and
presenting more big-name performers.

"The challenge is how we adjust this business model to survive," said Jerry
Brunswick, Cityfolk board president. "Frankly, that is why we constantly think
about what we present, and what fits within our mission statement and within
genuine folk music."

Booking performers for multiple cities might allow Cityfolk to get a better
price and be more proactive in hiring acts, Brunswick said.

Alter plans to seek more community input regarding performers for Cityfolk's
festival and year-round program of concerts. "We know what we like to see here
in the office, but we don't know what the community as a whole likes to see,"
she said.

Alter brings a wealth of experience to Cityfolk, having served as chief
executive of French Quarter Festivals in New Orleans and executive director of
the Three Rivers Festival in Fort Wayne, Ind.

French Quarter Festivals hosted three annual events, including its signature
festival, which featured New Orleans performers on 16 stages and had an average
attendance of about 350,000 people. "It was the Southeast's largest free music
festival," Alter said.

Alter arrived in New Orleans in July 2005, about one month before Hurricane
Katrina devastated the region. The storm and its aftermath impacted both the
city and the festival organization, she said.

"It was a pretty tough two years down there," said Alter, who returned to the
midwest in September 2007. Most recently, she worked as director of business
development for the American Holistic Medical Association in Cleveland.

Alter's festival experience, systematic approach to management and fundraising
skills made her the top choice among nearly 10 finalists for the Cityfolk
position, Brunswick said.

Alter was attracted by the Cityfolk Festival, a free, three-day event that
started in 1999 following a three-year Dayton residency of the National Folk
Festival. This year's festival attracted an estimated 75,000 people to
River-scape MetroPark, according to Cityfolk officials.

Such festivals help make people "take ownership of their city," Alter said.

Alter also was intrigued by Cityfolk's Culture Builds Community program, which
brings folk, ethnic and traditional music and dance performers into Dayton-area
churches, community centers, senior homes and schools.

"I think in a lot of cases we expose them to things they never even knew
existed," Alter said. "That was the biggest component that really made me love
this organization."

Alter succeeds John Harris, who is credited with stabilizing and steering
Cityfolk through hard times over seven years. Harris announced his departure in
January, but remained as executive director through the 2010 City-folk Festival
in July.

Cityfolk has an annual budget of about $1 million and a staff of six, including
Alter, Brunswick said.

The Cityfolk Festival's annual budget ranges from $300,000 to $400,000,
depending on how staff-related costs are accounted, Brunswick said. That budget
remains a challenge on an annual basis, he said.

"What we're striving to do is achieve a business model that makes that more
certain from year to year," Brunswick said.

The Friends of the Festival campaign launched this year to help offset lost
corporate funds reached its $40,000 goal. Alter hopes to expand that campaign
for the 2011 festival.

Cityfolk's goal is to continue the popular festival well into the future.

"The complexion of it may change, but we'll do what we can to make sure it stays
around," Alter said.

CHS grad arranging music for Alter band

BYLINE: By Pamela Ferris-Olson Contributing Writer

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD-1

LENGTH: 491 words


KETTERING - Nick Riley knows the path between wickedness and salvation is
enhanced by the steady pulse of a percussion section.

That is what the 2007 Centerville High School graduate has arranged for the
Alter Marching Knights band to do this season with their 2008 show titled
"Salvation" with music of Bach, Stravinsky and Biebl.

Riley, a music education student at Capital University in Columbus, has been the
percussion director and arranger/composer of Alter's marching band percussion
section since he graduated from Centerville.

"A friend of mine told me that Alter had a new band director and was heading in
a much better direction than previous years. I contacted him and that day was
interviewed and hired on the spot," Riley said.

The Marching Knights, a Class A band in the Mid-States Band Association, has 16
wind and 11 percussion musicians and four in color guard.

The band performs at football games, MSBA local and circuit competitions, and
local parades.

Working with Alter isn't treason for Riley, who was a member of Centerville's
marching band.

"CHS and Alter do compete together at marching band contests, but not directly.
CHS is in the Open Class in the Mid-States Band Association (the class with the
largest bands) and Alter is in Class A (the class with the smallest bands). It
would be very difficult for the 31-member Alter band to defeat the 196-member
Centerville Jazz Band," Riley said.

Riley showed an interest in percussion at the age of 5. He plays a range of
percussion instruments from snare drum to piano.

At Capital, Riley performs with a number of bands and prefers the concert band,
but his passion is for teaching and watching the marching band. His career goal
is to be a high school band director.

"One of my particular aspirations is to become the percussion caption head or
arranger for a drum and bugle corps (a professional marching band)," Riley said.
"Part of that dream is being realized this summer when I tour as the front
ensemble technician with the newly formed Open Class drum and bugle corps, Magic
of Mobile, from Mobile, Ala."

Riley worked with other Alter band staff, including director Todd Tucker and
Florida-based composer Tim Hinton to create the 2008 show.

They began the creative process in December and previewed the music in April.

During the summer and fall, Alter band members attend clinics and camps to learn
and perfect the show.

"The biggest challenge working with Alter is dealing with kids of all age levels
and musical backgrounds. Our youngest member is a 12-yearold seventh-grader and
our oldest member is an 18-year-old senior," Riley said.

"Working with kids of such varied musical experience and skill is a significant
challenge to write music around and to teach. My aim is to challenge the
students with difficult music that I know that they cannot play right away and
then help them improve. As a result, we have developed a very formidable Class A
band and percussion section."

More major tests await Alter girls;
Unbeaten basketball team takes on rivals Fairmont and Chaminade Julienne next
week.

BYLINE: By Greg Billing Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 314 words


First semester exams wrap up today, Jan. 22, for Alter High School students.

For the Knights girls basketball team, though, two major tests are scheduled for
next week. Alter (13-0) hosts Fairmont (12-1) at 7:30 p.m. Monday and plays
Chaminade Julienne (9-5) at 6 p.m. Friday, Jan. 29, at the Nutter Center.

"It seems like not a week goes by that's not like that," Alter coach Chris Hart
said of tough matchups and tough teams, all looking to end the Knights' 15-game
regular-season win streak. "We're focused on two things right now: Exams and
McNick on Saturday."

Alter travels to Cincinnati McNicholas (5-8) on Saturday for a Girls Greater
Cincinnati League game. Then it's on to rivalry week.

Fairmont is rated No. 1 in Division I of the Dayton Daily News rankings and is
close to cracking the top 10 in the state poll. Alter is No. 1 in Division II of
the DDN ratings and also tops the state poll.

Both teams have potential to play deep into the postseason: Fairmont reached the
regional finals and Alter the state semis last season.

"That says a lot about Kettering, and it says a lot about basketball in the
Southwest District," Hart said. "Tim (Cogan) goes a great job at Fairmont."

The two teams haven't played since Alter's 43-35 win in 2007. Fairmont had
committed to playing in a Columbus tournament the past two seasons, but didn't
this year. That opened up a spot for Alter.

Friday's game against CJ is a doubleheader with the CJ and Alter boys teams
playing at 7:30 p.m.

Springboro hockey wins MLK title

Springboro's hockey team won its second tournament title, winning the Martin
Luther King Classic on Sunday.

Springboro (14-7) beat Troy 2-1 in the championship game.

The Trojans, meanwhile, upset then-undefeated Kenston 2-0 to reach the finals.
Kenston, a private school in northeast Ohio, entered the game 26-0.

Troy has two seniors, and the majority of its roster is freshmen.

Former FPC runner signs with Florida Southern

BYLINE: Andrew Mikula Staff Writer

SECTION: C; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 548  words

DATELINE: PALM COAST


If the small campus atmosphere and the Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture wasn't
enough to convince him, Jon Alter has other reasons for his decision to go to
Florida Southern University on a partial athletic scholarship.

The four-year letterman and co-captain of the Flagler Palm Coast High School
track and cross country teams owes a lot of his very existence to the Lakeland
school.

It's where his parents, Dr. Den nis and Laurie Alter, met and fell in love.

Alter is a recent graduate of FPC and he made the decision to go to Florida
Southern several months back after considering several other schools.

The 18-year-old said he is probably going to follow his father's footsteps --
Dr. Alter is a well-known Palm Coast surgeon who has treated many current and
former FPC athletes -- into the medical profession.

"I liked the coach, the campus atmosphere, the student body, everything about
the school," Alter said. "I was looking for a small school and it's nice that
it's close to home.

"It's a good school for academics."

Alter is bringing some respectable running credentials to the Moccasins, who
have a young, up and coming cross country program.

For the past two seasons, he was a member of an FPC cross country team that
blazed its way to two Class 3A state titles. He was a scoring runner for the
team both years and a dedicated performer in his freshman and sophomore years.

"He's been a major player on our team all four years," Bulldogs Coach Peter
Hopfe said. "He's developed into a great leader, which was critical for our
team, and I'm sure he's going to take those qualities and use them to help his
future team."

A big example of Alter's dedication came in his freshman year during cross
country season. Although not a part of the starting seven at the time, he
decided to forego part of a weekend school party at Walt Disney World to have
his mother pick him up and go to a Saturday morning meet in Jacksonville.

His personal best high school performance came this past season at the state
meet in Tampa. Alter ran a 16:33 for the 5-kilometer race, placing 16th in a
field of 185 runners and fourth on the Bulldogs' team. FPC bested second place
Tampa Plant by 63 points.

"I'd have to say helping win states in my junior and senior year was a high
point because it was something we all worked hard for," Alter said.

Alter had two other sub-16:50 races in the 2002 season, including the Boone
Invitational in Orlando and District 3-3A race at Belleview. Twice named to the
First Team of The News-Journal's All Area boys cross country team, Alter also
was picked to run in the Florida Athletic Coaches Association senior all star
race. He placed 24th in the field at 16:51 in the race at Tallahassee's
Miccosukee Greenway Park.

Alter said he also had scholarship offers from the University of West Florida,
the University of North Florida and Stetson University before picking his
parents' alma mater.

Florida Southern finished fifth this season at the NAIA Division II South
Regional Cross Country meet in November in Huntsville, Ala. The Moccasins were
the third best Florida team in a field of 18.

Florida Southern head Coach Buck Dawson also recruited two other top runners in
the state to bolster his program, including Tony Lyons of Citrus and Jimmy
Murphy of Orange Park Ridgeview.

Electrolysis Clinic and Avon lady. After ten years as Director of Communications
and Public Relations at Oklahoma Christian Home (now Bradford Village), she
retired in 1997.  Among her many areas of civic and community involvement for
which she is best known, Betty served as President of Lion's Club, member and

greeted and embraced. She will be missed terribly, but her incomparable legacy
of caring for others will live on for all eternity. A public viewing will be

Suburban developer affordable housing crusader, champion

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 420 words


William "Bill" A. Alter, founder and chairman of Skokie-based Alter Group, died
Friday at his Winnetka home of complications from Alzheimer's. He was 78.

The Alter Group, one of the top commercial firms nationwide, has been
instrumental in developing affordable housing in Chicago-area suburbs. It's
known for Loop properties like the Pittsfield Center, a 1927 recently designated
for student housing, and Dearborn Plaza, Google's Midwest headquarters.

Alter, a native of Chicago's South Side and an engineering graduate of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, began to transition control of the
business to his son, Michael, in 1995. He had been battling Alzheimer's for
several years and succumbed to complications from pneumonia, spokeswoman Kristin
Bird.

A recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Urban Land Institute in
Chicago, Alter created a company that became one of the top commercial real
estate firms with more than $1 billion worth of office, industrial and health
care projects nationally. The Alter Group, which has operations in Atlanta and
Phoenix, is ranked 6th largest in the nation by Commercial Property News
magazine.

Alter's Realty Company of America, Inc. developed nearly 7,000 homes for postwar
first-time buyers and their growing families.

The defining moment of his early career came in South Suburban Markham, where he
developed Kingston Green, the nation's first residential community for
middle-income minority buyers. With Olympian Jesse Owens as his national
spokesman, Alter brought the American dream to hundreds of families who
previously had been excluded from homeownership.

In 1967, he also was instrumental in developing the rustic bridge in the
Kingsbridge subdivision on Arlington Heights' south end, Bird said.

Also in the 1960s, Alter began assembling commercial sites in Chicago's River
North neighborhood, as well as in DuPage County along what today is the I-88
East-West Tollway and I-355 North-South Tollway.

Alter is survived by his wife, Evelyn. He is the father of four grown children:
Michael Alter, Harvey Alter, Jonathan Alter and Jennifer Alter Abt, two step
children, Nicole Bliwas and Tony Winski, and 13 grandchildren.

Chapel service will be held today at 12:30 p.m. at Shalom Memorial Funeral Home,
1700 W. Rand Road, Arlington Heights, followed by interment at Shalom Memorial
Park.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations to the Weizmann Institute of
Science, Keshet for special needs children and adults, or the Alzheimer's
Association.

DU's 'first lady' dies at 90

BYLINE: By The Denver Post

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-02

LENGTH: 165 words


Arvilla Morrison Alter, the wife of former University of Denver Chancellor
Chester Alter, died Dec. 23 in Denver. She was 90.

Alter was affectionately called "the first lady" of DU during the 14 years of
Chester Alter's administration - from 1953 to 1967 - because of her active role
in the life of the university.

She was instrumental in forming the Women's Library Association, a support group
for DU's Penrose Library. She took special interest in DU's many international
students, often entertaining them in her home.

Born in Portland, Maine, she graduated from Wheaton College in Massachusetts in
1928. She taught at a junior college until she married in 1933. She commented
about her husband in a 1994 interview, "I wouldn't swap him. My life has been
with his."

She is survived by her husband and a son, Richard Alter of Modesto, Calif.

A private service is scheduled. Memorial contributions may be made to Wheaton
College in Massachusetts or the University of Denver.

Alter fundraiser comes together: Benefit for boy with heart defect set for April
25.

BYLINE: John Mangalonzo, The Hawk Eye, Burlington, Iowa

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 559 words


Apr. 3--No one really knows whether the distance between Jeremiah Alter and his
mother Shellis will cease to exist now that the lawsuit that intensified their
torn relationship concluded in March.

Jeremiah, 29, and his wife Bridget, 27, have been ordered to pay Shellis Alter
$976.25 for what Shellis Alter said was money owed to her for babysitting her
4-year-old grandson, Angelus. The payments will be $20 per month with a 2.62
percent interest.

Focusing on that order and their obligation to make payments did not hinder
Jeremiah and Bridget, along with other family and friends to grab the bull by
the horns and organize a benefit for Angelus, who has a hereditary heart defect,
tetralogy of fallot, which is a rare and complex heart defect that occurs in
about five of every 10,000 babies.

He had open heart surgery when he was just 4 months old and is due to go back to
Iowa City in June for more tests. He must have another open heart surgery by
next summer.

The benefit is planned for April 25 at the Mind and Body Martial Arts School on
East Main Street in New London. It will be from noon to 5 p.m., with door
prizes, raffles and silent auction of items donated by nearly 60 area and
out-of-town merchants.

Tammy Norton who along with her mother Linda Norton, helped organize the event.
The former is Bridget Alter's aunt and the latter is her grandmother.

Items range from golf packages, merchandise, jewelry, services and gift
certificates. The winners of the silent auction will be announced at 4 p.m.

"I'm still trying for Chicago Cubs and Hawkeye tickets," said Tammy Norton. As
for the other donations, "I just call them and tell them the story and why we're
doing this, and they were more than willing to donate."

All the proceeds from the event will go toward Angelus Alter's medical expenses.

"We've set up a savings account for Angel at MidWest One Bank, and all the money
will go directly to that savings account, and the only things that will be drawn
out of there are for medical bills," Bridget Alter said.

Along with the auction and raffle, Bridget Alter said there also will be a
petting zoo for the children who will attend with their parents. Baked goodies
also will be plentiful.

Hopefully it all raises enough money for Angelus' needs.

When he is tested in June, "we'll find out what to expect next summer and what
our next step is," Bridget Alter said. "We're very optimistic, so we keep
hoping, by some miracle, they'll give us another year."

Bridget Alter said the lawsuit brought about by her mother in law, Shellis Alter
, is now behind them and they have to move forward, centering their attention to
the one who truly deserves it: Angelus.

For Jeremiah and Bridget Alter, the small claims suit made them see each other
in a whole different light -- it made them stronger as a couple and as a family.

"It made us closer. It helped us get closer together," Bridget Alter said.
"There's something good that came out of it."

Boat originator's son wins first ProSail title for Hobies

BYLINE: KIM LENNON

SECTION: SPORTS; sailing; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 408 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



TAMPA - Hobie Alter Jr. of Capistrano Beach, Calif., and crewman    Carl Nunez
of San Diego finished second in both races Sunday but it was    good enough to
win the overall title in the first regatta of the    ProSail World Series of
Sailing held off Davis Island.

     The field was composed of Hobie 21 catamarans that were built just    six
months ago.

        "It was good competition," said Alter Jr., son of Hobie Alter    Sr.,
who produced the first Hobie catamaran 20 years ago. "Everybody    was learning.

 None of us have that much time on the boat."

     The Fort Walton Beach team of Carlton Tucker and Glenn Purcell    finished
second, 2 1/2 points behind Alter.

     "It was very, very challenging," Tucker said of shifting winds    that were
clocked at 6 knots at the start but increased to a steady 12    knots by the
second race on the 6-mile course.

     Tucker and Purcell took three firsts in the two-day, five-race    regatta,
but a fourth place in Sunday's first race and a fifth in    Saturday's first
race cost them the championship. Alter and Nunez had      one first and four
seconds.

     "Race number one was a pretty sad race for us," Tucker, 29, said    of
Sunday's first race. "If anything cost us the series, that would be    the
race."

     Brian Stewart and Rick Hohenhauser of Sarasota finished third    overall.

     The sailors, who usually compete for plaques or trophies, were    going
after a $ 5,000 purse that ranged from $ 2,000 for first to $ 250    for fifth.

     "I like the idea of the money being in it because now I can afford    to go
to the next one," said Tucker, who collected $ 1,250.

     The Tampa race was the first of three regional qualifying events    for
Hobie 21s. The top 10 boats will advance to the ProSail    Championship Series
in Newport, R.I., on Aug. 10-14. There they will be    joined by the Formula 40
class, which features 40-foot high performance    catamarans and trimarans, in
competition for an overall purse of    $ 330,000. The series will conclude in
Miami on Dec. 4-10.

     Alter said he thinks he and Nunez have a good chance of winning the
series.

     "We have as good a chance as anyone else," said Alter, 31, who's    been
sailing for 25 years.

RECRUITING

Alter lineman Dean Lemon (right) is one of the Knights' juniors who should get
plenty of attention from college recruiters.

Eric Frantz

It's not uncommon for college football coaches to recruit Alter High School.
Expect these next 12 months, however, to be bustling.

The Knights have an extremely deep and attractive junior class.

The headliner? Defensive tackle Kraig Howe (6-3, 253) who picked up a new offer
from Northwestern this week. Howe also owns offers from Illinois, Pitt, Toledo
and Miami. Consider the Wildcats offer, which he received from head coach Pat
Fitzgerald, one of Howe's favorites. Georgia Tech, Boston College and Vanderbilt
are also showing interest in the Bellbrook native.

Other notable junior prospects for Alter include defensive lineman Dean Lemon
(6-2, 223), punter Alex Craft (6-0, 204), linebacker Dylan Black (6-1,

190) and defensive back Nick Coleman (6-0, 170), who picked up his first offer
from Pitt this week.

Among the schools spotted at Alter recently have been Ohio State, Michigan
State, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Northwestern, Pitt, Purdue, Wisconsin,
UTEP, Southern Mississippi, Florida Atlantic and Miami.

Change of plans: Centerville senior offensive lineman Jared Weyler (6-4, 280)
committed to Minnesota after previously pledging Bowling Green. Weyler visited
Minnesota last weekend and was impressed.

"They have a mindset of getting after it and going after people, and that's how
I've played my entire life," Weyler told gopher247.com. "At Centerville we use
the triple option, we're really physical at the point of contact and we get
rough with people."

Weyler also had offers from Ohio, Ball State, Middle Tennessee, Toledo, Buffalo,
Miami, Akron and Air Force.

Hoying update: Cold-water junior quarterback/ defensive back Brody Hoying (5-11,
180) recently visited Toledo and is getting increased interest from Michigan
State, specifically from assistant coach Mike Tressel. Consider Hoying on the
Spartans radar.

Fellers commits: Miami East senior wide receiver Michael Fellers (5-11, 171) has
committed to Notre Dame College. He may also do some kicking for the Falcons
next fall. Fellers received his offer while on his way to practice for the Blue
Grey All-American Bowl in Dallas in December.

Didn't take long: A day after we reported Miamis-burg freshman offensive lineman
Josh Myers (6-5,

275) had received an offer from Indiana, he got another one, from Illinois. The
next day he got one from Ohio.

End zone: Troy senior defensive end Seth Over-la (6-3, 225) committed to
Hillsdale. He picked the Chargers over Furman, Dayton, Ohio Dominican, Morehead
State and Cornell. ... Clinton-Massie senior defensive lineman Kyle Aubry (6-0,
225) has committed to Notre Dame College.

Junior Emma Bockrath, part of one of Alter's two starting sister duos, is the
Knights' leading scorer, averaging 14.5 points entering the state semifinals.
MARC PENDLETON / STAFF

Alter long ago established itself as a state boys football and basketball power.
The Knights girls programs are no longer playing catch-up.

Alter was the state runner-up in Division II volleyball last fall. The Knights
also advanced to the D-II girls state soccer final four.

On Thursday, Alter will play in the girls high school basketball D-II state
semifinals in Columbus. Several Alter basketball players were on those
volleyball and soccer teams.

"We have great athletes," Knights girls basketball head coach Chris Hart said,
"very driven and very goal-oriented. You have to give them a lot of credit in
this day and age. To be so successful at more than one sport is not easy to do."

Unbeaten Alter (28-0) will play upstart Toledo Rogers (24-4) in Thursday's 1
p.m. D-II state semifinal at Ohio State University's Schottenstein Center. The
game also will kick off the three-day, season-ending state tournament.

At 3 p.m. Thursday, top-ranked Millersburg West Holmes (27-0) will play Akron
St. Vincent-St. Mary (25-2) in the other D-II semi. The winners will play at
10:45 a.m. in Saturday's first of four state championship games.

Other area teams seeking girls state basketball titles are Versailles (23-3) in
D-III and Fort Loramie (26-2) in D-IV. Loramie is the defending D-IV state
champ.

Offensively, the Knights are outstanding in the running game, rebounding and
shooting. And they might be even better defensively.

Alter defeated Kenton Ridge 65-48 in last week's regional final in Springfield.
That represented the most points Alter had allowed since Jan. 21. Until Kenton
Ridge, Alter had allowed 39 points or less in 10 straight games.

"To have the kind of year that we've had, once the season is over and once we
get through the (postseason) banquet and we have some time to reflect on the
year, we'll be able to appreciate what we have accomplished because it has been
special and unique," Hart said.

Also unique is Alter's starting lineup, which has two pairs of sisters. Junior
Emma Bockrath leads the Knights in scoring (14.5 points). Senior Kara Bockrath
also is a guard (6.9 points). The Bazelak sisters, Libby and Maddie, are the
other starting siblings. Maddie is a junior (10.2) and Libby a freshman (7.4).

Completing the starting lineup is heralded freshman Braxtin Miller (10.3).

Fort Loramie will play Reedsville Eastern (25-1) in a D-IV semi at 8 p.m.
Thursday. Versailles is matched against Proctor-ville Fairland (22-3) at 3 p.m.
Friday.

McCREIGHT LECTURE SERIES;
UC-Berkeley scholar to speak here on Bible

BYLINE: Paul J. Nyden Staff writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P1A

LENGTH: 696 words


Studying literary scholarship, along with Hebrew language and culture, inspired
Robert Alter to study various translations of the Bible and to begin publishing
new translations of his own.

"My training was in the field of comparative literature. I worked on
18th-century to 20th-century European literature and American fiction, Alter
said, during an interview with the Gazette-Mail.

Alter will deliver the annual McCreight Lecture in the Humanities on Thursday at
7:30 p.m. at the University of Charleston. Sponsored by the West Virginia
Humanities Council, the program is free and open to the public.

Alter has published 23 books.

"My route - first into biblical studies, then biblical translations - was a
rather unusual one, he said. "I got interested in biblical narratives. My book,
The Art of Biblical Narratives,' came out in 1981.

"Four years later, I came out with a book on biblical poetry. I continued to
write articles from time to time, and put some of them together in another book.

"By happenstance, somebody at Norton [the book publishing company] suggested I
do a Norton Critical Edition, either on Franz Kafka or something from the Bible.

"I asked if I could write about the book of Genesis. There is something wrong
with all the translations, Alter said. "At that point, the editor at Norton got
into a conversation with my agent.

What emerged was not the Norton Critical Edition but a new translation of
Genesis.

"That came out in 1998. I didn't really have a clear sense of the road I was
beginning to march on. What I wanted to do was produce a translation of the
whole Hebrew edition of the Bible that would do justice to its literary power
and subtlety.

Alter grew up in Albany, New York, then moved to New York City in the 1950s to
attend Columbia University, which made it possible for him to also attend the
nearby Jewish Theological Seminary.

In 1967, he moved to California and became a professor in Hebrew and comparative
literature on the Berkeley campus of the University of California. In the
mid-1970s, Alter began focusing on the Bible and its different translations.

After publishing his new translation of Genesis, Alter said, "I did a series of
books, including the five books of Moses and the Psalms.

"Today, I have more than two-thirds of the Hebrew Bible [from Genesis through
Kings, in the Old Testament] finished. I will make a push and see if I can do
the whole thing.

Alter said his work gets widely varied reactions from different readers.

"I don't think my translations are selling among fundamentalists in the Bible
Belt, he said, "but I have a lot of enthusiastic readers from Episcopal nuns to
Presbyterians and Orthodox Jews.

Discussing his upcoming lecture in Charleston, Alter said, "First, I am going to
talk a bit about the King James Version. It was so decisive in the history of
the English translations of the Bible. I will talk about its strengths and its
problems.

"Then I will say something quite brief about Biblical translations done in the
second half of the 20th Century - all of which I find unsatisfactory.

Alter, now 79, still lives in Berkeley.

"I have been at the university for well over 40 years, he said. "I like it here.
I like living here. I love the students.

"I have been technically retired for three years, but I am still quite engaged
in the university. I teach one graduate course a year. Now I seem to have gotten
myself into getting to be director for a new Center for Jewish Studies.

Alter said his translations try to reflect the fact that members of desert
tribes in the Old Testament lived in a stark and brutal world.

"My translation tries hard - doesn't always succeed - but tries hard to convey
to English readers the literary values of the Hebrew rhythms, subtleties of word
choice and, sometimes, word play.

"In the Hebrew Bible, writers were impelled by a powerful religious imperative.
They often decided to clash their visions in very articulate narrative, and
sometimes poetic, ways.

Alter said he believes his translations give readers new perspectives into what
the Bible's original writers "had to say and God, humankind and ethical values.

Alter hoops star to play Division II

BYLINE: Dave Lamb HERE AND THERE

SECTION: CENTERVILLE BELLBROOK; Pg. Z2-18

LENGTH: 366 words


Alter High School basketball standout Danny Bruner didn't simply lead the
Greater Catholic League in blocked shots last season. He also had more swats
than every team in the league except Cincinnati St. Xavier.

But you won't hear the 6-foot-7 senior boasting that he owns the lane. Instead,
he'll soft sell the accomplishment that he says came mostly against shorter
players and that he had pretty good timing.

When he lists his highlights from Alter's 12-10 season, he won't immediately
mention his three-pointer with three seconds left that beat Cincinnati Purcell
Marian. Or his trey at the buzzer that forced overtime against Cincinnati
McNicholas.

"The last-second finishes are great to have," he said.

"But I like the games when we win comfortably, where everyone gets to play and
everyone contributes."

That's the sort of modest attitude that Alter coach Joe Petrocelli is going to
miss. And that Fairmont State University coach Tim Murphy is going to inherit.

Bruner recently signed a letter of intent to play basketball at the NCAA
Division II school in Fairmont, W. Va., near Morgantown.

"Danny's going to do very well," Petrocelli said. "He really came into his own
halfway through last year and we relied on him a lot this year. He's very
coachable and he's a very good student."

Bruner led the Knights in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (6.6). He also paced the
team in shooting percentage on two-pointers (51.7) and threepointers (32.8).

He earned first-team All-GLC North Division honors.

Bruner, who carries better than a 3.9 grade-point average, is considering a
business major at Fairmont. He's working this summer for Kohls' Landscaping.

Fairmont State graduates just two players from a 13-14 team.

Bellbrook's Frost chosen for state All-Star game

Bellbrook High School senior Justin Frost has been selected to play in the Ohio
North-South All-Star Game in Columbus in June.

The 6-4, 240-pound center will continue his football career at the University of
Indianapolis, which plays in the rugged NCAA II Division Great Lakes Valley
Conference.

Frost was a two-year starter for the Eagles and also played as a sophomore on
the offensive line.

LENGTH: 440 words


It is with great sadness that we share the news of Jean Alter's death, after a
prolonged illness. He was 86. Jean died at home in the presence of his wife,
Hélène des Rosiers and friend Annie Martel of Seattle, who helped care for him
in his last moments. Jean had survived numerous health challenges over the last
three years but succumbed to pulmonary embolism, following a long-standing
diagnosis

of Parkinson's disease.



 A Celebration of Jean's Life will be held with friends and family, Jean Victor
Alter was born in Warsaw, Poland, on October 7th 1925. Son of Wiktor Alter, who
was a Jewish social activist and leader of the Bund between the two World Wars,
and Melania Lorein Alter, from Ghent, Belgium. He lived in Warsaw until his
early teenage years and then in Belgium where he and his mother had travelled
for their annual summer vacation, just before the invasion of Poland by the Nazi
army.

Paris. He received a Fulbright Fellowship that led him to obtain his Doctorate
degree at the University of Chicago.



 He taught graduate studies in French literature, comparative literature and
semiology at various east coast universities, namely Howard, in Washington DC,
Case Western Reserve, in Ohio and University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia,
where he held the Chair of the Romance Languages Department for several years

including Les origines de la satire anti-bourgeoise en France and A
Sociosemiotic Theory of Theatre .

Rosiers from Montréal, Québec. Together, they travelled extensively to Latin
America, Europe and North Africa. They celebrated his 85th birthday in Paris,
his favorite city. His European travels brought him back to Poland and Belgium,
where he had spent his youth.



 He is survived by : his wife, Hélène des Rosiers, and her son and
daughter-in-law Renaud and Beth des Rosiers of Boulder, Colorado and their
daughters, Sala and Théa who brought many smiles to his face; his daughter Nora

STILL SISTERS

The former big and little were matched for almost six years,

forging a relationship that remains rock-solid today

Cheryl Alters Jamison and Lenore Tapia can't say enough good things about Big
Brothers Big Sisters of Northern New Mexico.

The former "big" and "little" were matched for almost six years, forging a
relationship that remains rock-solid today, some 16 years after their official
match ended. For that, they say thank you.

They do, however, have one bone to pick with the organization.

"We both got a letter one day saying, 'Well, it's over.' We said, 'no it's not.
We're not done,' " Alters Jamison said.

Tapia also remembered the letter. "I never thought about getting out. I called
her and said, 'Did you get this letter?' "

The letter, of course, came because Tapia had reached 18 and was too old for the
program that had matched her with Alters Jamison when the younger girl was still
in middle school. Her mother had just died, and Tapia's father sought Big
Sisters for all three of his girls. Their relationship took hold -- as did
dozens of other matches in those early days of the organization. The pairs are
invited to attend the group's 25th anniversary picnic Sept. 19 at Ragle Park.

Tapia and Alters Jamison became fast friends.

They started their friendship carving pumpkins for Halloween, cemented it riding
bikes, roller skating and cooking. Eventually, Tapia accompanied Alters Jamison
on trips she took for her job at the Western States Arts Foundation, including a
memorable trip to New Orleans. The duo even took part in a commercial filmed on
the Santa Fe Plaza for then-U.S. Rep. Bill Richardson, back when New Mexico's
governor wasn't a household name.

The friendship was a two-way street. Tapia was exposed to a world beyond Santa
Fe, and Alters Jamison was included in an extended family's traditions and
celebrations. Alters Jamison attended Las Posadas at Tapia's home and Fiesta
events the year Tapia's cousin was La Reina, and she visited the family's ranch
in Moriarty.

"It was just a wonderful way for me as a newcomer to town to get a look at the
culture of the area," Alters Jamison said.

Tapia's dad would drive his daughter to the highway to meet Alters Jamison --
her little car couldn't handle the road to the Tapia home during winter months.
Those were "Lenore drops."

The program, Tapia said, "gave me a friend outside the family I could talk to.
It was easy for us to get along because we both liked to talk."

Out of her sisters, "I'm the only one who stayed in the match," Tapia said. "She
encouraged me in my life to do things with myself."

She enjoyed BBBS so

much that after graduation and getting her first job, Tapia herself became a Big
Sister -- she's been matched three times.

"I got to be the first grand-sister," said Alters Jamison, who became a board
member for the organization after her match with Tapia ended.

Both women said the match encouraged Tapia's independence. She loves to travel
and recently built her own home in Eldorado with the help of her father and
other family members. This month, she's starting a new job at a bank after years
of running the coffee bar at a local Albertson's.

The two women still call and e-mail one another, although roller skating is no
longer on the menu. They are united by their shared memories, their love of
cooking (Alters Jamison is a cookbook author with her husband, Bill) and their
joy in laughter.

They believe in the transformative power of friendship.

Alters Jamison remembered the trip to New Orleans, when she and Tapia had
planned to eat at chef Paul Prudhomme's restaurant but discovered their presence
was required at a work-related banquet instead -- a banquet that could have
proved dull as dishwater for a teenage girl among strangers.

"Lenore was seated between a critic for Newsweek and a banker," Alters Jamison
remembered. "She was the toast of the table. It was so fun to see the poise she
had developed. She just charmed them. É When I first met her, she was shy,
quiet. I realized then that nothing was going to stop that kid."

Celebrating 25 years

The Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northern New Mexico 25th anniversary picnic will
take place from noon to 4 p.m. Sept. 19 at Ragle Park off Zia Road. All former
Bigs and Littles are encouraged to attend.

Alter Jr. leads after first day of professional yacht race series

BYLINE: KIM LENNON

SECTION: SPORTS; sailing; Pg. 14C

LENGTH: 356 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



TAMPA - Hobie Alter Jr. of Capistrano Beach, Calif., took the lead    Saturday
after the first day of the ProSail World Series of Sailing    held off Davis
Island.

     The event - the nation's first pro yacht race - is the first stop    in the
six-race ProSail tour. The tour will feature some of the    nation's top Hobie
21 sailors competing for a purse of $ 145,000. The    Formula 40's will join the
tour in Newport, R.I., on Aug. 11-14 to    compete for an overall purse of $
330,000.

     The first heat was delayed for four hours by a lack of wind. By 3    p.m.,
winds had increased to 5 knots and the boats were under way.

 Winds reached 12 knots for the second and third heats.

     Alter Jr., 31, and crewman Carl Nunez of San Diego captured a first    and
two seconds in the three heats. They lead the overall standings    going into
today's races, which will begin at 10 a.m. Carlton Tucker of    Fort Walton
Beach and Brian Stewart of Sarasota are second and third.

     Alter Jr. is the son of Hobie Alter Sr., who developed the first    Hobie
catamaran 20 years ago. The Hobie 21, which was introduced six    months ago,
can reach speeds of 30 knots (35 mph). Only 70 boats have    been produced and
28 were entered for Saturday's race.

     "It's an entry-level class that doesn't take a millionaire to get
wnvolved in," said Sid Morris, ProSail's executive director. Morris    said a
fully rigged Hobie 21 costs about $ 8,500.

     Unlike other sailing regattas, the ProSail series is easily viewed    from
land.

     "The ProSail concept is one of putting sailors and boats close to    shore
and modifying the courses so that they'll be accessible to    spectators,"
Morris said. The best view is off Davis Island Yacht Club    or Bayshore Drive.

     The Tampa race is one of three regional qualifying events to use    the
Hobie 21. The top 10 sailors will advance to the ProSail    Championship series
in Newport, R.I., Aug. 11-14.

and identity, and to help them build a positive self-image.

The project also provides an opportunity for young Americans to open their
hearts to children who have endured many hardships, and to promote the value of
sharing kindness with others.

Students at Alter received pictures of children who are waiting for portraits
and then work in their art classes to create the portraits.

Once finished, the Memory Project organization delivers the portraits to the
children, and the children are invited to create drawings or write letters to
send back to the art students.

Students Kelly Glardon, Emily Wall, Laura Pelstring, Madison Schneider, Kaitlyn
Davis and Lauren Wissman will be working with children at an orphanage in
Mexico.

Alter Fest a Labor Day weekend rite;
Three-day festival features new attractions this year to complement its 'Famous
Chicken Dinners.'

BYLINE: By Jim DeBrosse Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 399 words


KETTERING - Chickens may come home to roost, but they've got nothing on 1968
Alter High School graduate Willie Bruns.

Bruns has returned to his alma mater every Labor Day weekend for the past 25
years to prepare the special sauce and supervise the grilling of some 3,000 half
chickens for Alter Fest's "Famous Chicken Dinners." And for the past 12 years,
he has flown from his home in Seattle to volunteer.

Festival organizers expect as many as 40,000 visitors to the three-day
fundraising event for the high school, which continues today through Monday. New
attractions this year include a sports bar "tent" with big screen TVs and food
service provided by Buffalo Wild Wings, as well as an outdoor cabaret featuring
some of the Dayton area's hottest bands.

"We couldn't ask for better weather," said Martha Hausmann, who, with husband
Bill, is this year's festival co-chair for the Alter High School Boosters
Association. Bill Hausmann said festival organizers tried to have "a little bit
for everybody," including games and rides for children, Blackjack and Texas Hold
'Em for the adults and live music throughout the day.

But from its inception 27 years ago, the mainstay of Alter Fest has been its
"Famous Chicken Dinners," with Bruns supervising the grilling for all but two of
those years.

His secret sauce is prepared in the home economics classroom at Alter, funneled
into three-gallon tanks and sprayed over the chicken halves as they move slowly
along the 40-foot-long open grill.

"He's done (the sauce) for so many years, we tease him about marketing it and
giving all the proceeds back to Alter," said former classmate and fellow
volunteer Stu Cochran. "Willie would let us do that."

Bruns said he wouldn't miss the annual trek home.

"It's fun. And I've got plenty of relatives here," he said.

Martha Hausmann said alumni, parents, students and teachers will provide a total
of 7,000 volunteer hours for the festival. Last year, it raised $240,000 for
schoolwide use. The funds have paid for everything from renovating the teachers'
lounge to purchasing computerized microscopes for student labs.

KETTERING - Alter High School is best known for producing NCAA Division I boys
basketball players, but another part of the program is quickly catching up.

Senior Allison Bockrath verbally committed to play basketball at Cornell
University on Tuesday. She will be the fourth Knights girl to play D-I ball in
the last five years.

"The opportunity to play with a young Ivy League school team was the best fit
for me," Bockrath said.

"I really connected with the coaches and the players during my visit. It is also
a beautiful campus with a great academic reputation."

Bockrath, 5 feet 10 inches, averaged a team-high 12.8 points and 5.6 rebounds
for Alter (19-6) last season. A three-year starter, she scored a season-high 23
points against Centerville.

Bockrath also was a first-team All-Girls' Greater Cincinnati League pick and
played on the Ohio Lady Attack AAU team that won the 11th grade national
championship last summer.

Also recruiting her were Austin Peay, Charleston (S.C.), Tennessee-Martin and
Florida Gulf Coast.

Other Alter graduatates playing D-I college ball are senior Courtney Chihil
(Florida Gulf Coast), sophomore Ashley Christie (Mount St. Mary's, Md.) and
senior Meghan Waterman (Niagara).

Cornell, located in Ithaca, N.Y., was 6-22 last season. Ivy League schools do
not offer athletic scholarships. However, the league winner is granted a spot in
the NCAA D-I Tournament.

Other area D-I players who have verbally committed are:

* Kelley Austria, Carroll/Dayton;

* Mariah Harris, Kenton Ridge/Michigan State;

* Raytea Long, CJ/ Vanderbilt;

* Brooklyn Pumroy, Fairborn/Marquette.

Dynamark Makes Its Mark;
Security Firm Founder Wins Md. SBA Award

BYLINE: Sandra Griffin del Villar, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FINANCIAL; PAGE F8

LENGTH: 686 words


When business at Wayne Alter Jr.'s Hagerstown security franchising company took
off and sales soared into the millions, Alter did what few entrepreneurs can
bring themselves to do -- he stepped aside.

His company, Dynamark Security Centers Inc., has grown to 250 locations
nationwide in 14 years. But in 1984, Alter, who is president and chief
executive, set up a council of Dynamark's franchisees, dealers and corporate
officers to make the decisions on company strategy. Alter doesn't serve on the
council.

Allowing others to share in corporate decision-making has helped his company
maintain working harmony, Alter said. In addition to monitoring, selling and
installing alarm systems, franchisees have banded together to work on community
projects, such as locating missing children.

Dynamark's fast growth, coupled with its community activity, won Alter the 1989
Maryland Small Business Person of the Year award from the U.S. Small Business
Administration. (The winner of the 1989 District of Columbia Small Business
Person award, which included nominees from the District, Northern Virginia, and
Montgomery and Prince George's counties, was Design Cuisine, a catering and
rentals service in Shirlington that is owned by Stavros Veletsis, Horst Klein
and William Homan.)

Alter's award puts him in contention for the 1989 Small-Business Person of the
Year, a national award to be announced today.

Letting others manage was not easy for Alter, but it has brought the company
success, he said.

"Growth doesn't kill a company, poor management of a company kills a company,"
he said. "You have to realize you can't do everything ... as you grow, you need
good people, and you can't keep or attract good people if they're not going to
be involved in the decision-making process."

Dynamark's council, known as the research and development council, is made up of
eight franchisees and four corporate officers. The council decides such issues
as which new products to market and screens potential franchisees and dealers.

Dynamark sells and installs dozens of different alarm systems for homes and
businesses. Operators at DynaWatch, a subsidiary of Dynamark, monitor these
systems through television-like screens and alert local authorities to fires,
burglaries or medical emergencies.

Alter started with one store in 1975, increased to five locations within the
first two years, and then one year later offered store managers the option to
buy and become dealers. In 1984, he offered dealers the option to franchise.
Currently, Dynamark has 150 franchises and 100 dealerships. Alter, who used to
own five stores, has sold all of his locations and oversees Dynamark from its
headquarters in Hagerstown.

Alter said all potential dealers and franchisees are screened during a one-week
training program at Dynamark's headquarters.

"A successful company comes from a team effort," Alter said. "Once you get a
business started, success is in the people you work with," not where they came
from, he said.

A lot of his dealers "started out in corporate America ... They found out that
it [the corporate world] wasn't what they thought it would be, and they went out
to find a business of their own," Alter said.

The corporation was named 1986's fastest growing franchisor by Venture magazine.
Combined sales from all of the dealerships and franchises was about $ 25 million
last year, Alter said.

Dynamark is also deeply involved in Child Seekers, a program of the National
Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Dynamark distributes posters of missing
children to its stores and, last month, donated $ 10,000 to the group.

The Hagerstown-Washington County Chamber of Commerce nominated Alter for the SBA
award. "Dynamark has been a good corporate citizen of this community for quite a
number of years," said Charles Stroh, the chamber's executive vice president.

As for Alter, he said he intends to keep on working to locate missing children
as well as opening new stores. He expects a 20 percent increase in sales this
year. "I think one's future is only limited by one's imagination," he said.

Alter coach uptight over loose team;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

SECTION: ; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 765 words


The unbeaten Knights won over Alter football coach Ed Domsitz long ago, but that
doesn't mean there haven't been some growing pains.

"It's strange because this team ends up doing more extra work during the week
because they do stupid stuff that irritates me, like walking on the practice
field or they're talking while I'm talking," Domsitz explained. "I'm watching
them (last) Thursday night and I'm thinking I wish I was someplace else. They
were loose, but I'm serious."

Alter (12-0) was at its serious best in last week's 28-0 shutout of high school
playoff rival Clinton-Massie. That sends Alter into a Division IV, Region 16
final against Cincinnati Wyoming (12-0) at Monroe. The showdown is one of two
Week 13 match-ups that feature unbeaten teams throughout the state.

Joining Alter in regional finals are Wayne (D-I), Miamisburg (D-II) and
Trot-wood-Madison (D-III) of the Greater Western Ohio Conference, Coldwater
(D-V), Marion Local (D-VI) and Fort Recovery and Minster (D-VII) of the Midwest
Athletic Conference, St. Marys Memorial (D-III) and Mechanics-burg (D-VI).

All the winners advance to next week's state semifinals. The Ohio High School
Athletic Association will announce some state semi bracket pairings and neutral
sites this week, and the others on Sunday.

This is an unprecedented haul of athletic success at Alter. Its boys and girls
won D-II state soccer championships this past weekend at Columbus and the
football program is hoping to do the same.

There are two common opponents Alter and Wyoming have beat, McNicholas and
Indian Hill. Alter blew out Indian Hill 54-28 in its playoff opener and Wyoming
needed two overtimes for a Week 4 win. Wyoming advanced by eliminating Valley
View 29-12 last week.

Domsitz may have reservations about the Knights' easy-going persona, "but they
come out and they play ball," he said.

The Knights have almost exclusively leaned on the run with senior Holden Rushing
(1,018 yards, 16 touchdowns), senior quarterback Ryan Markoff (895 and 13) and
emerging sophomore John Bivens (800 and 11). The defense, anchored by senior
linebacker David Rueth, was at its best in blanking Massie and allowing less
than 100 yards offense. Rueth was the starting goaltender in Sunday's state
soccer championship.

"I was so proud of our defense, our offense, our kicking game," Domsitz said.
"It was one of those games where everything came together."

? Fort Recovery put the D-VII field on notice that it isn't ready to relinquish
its defending state title after a 42-14 blowout of top-ranked Covington last
week. That puts the Indians (8-4) into a Region 28 final rematch against Minster
(8-4), the D-VI state champ in 2014, on Saturday at Wapakoneta.

Will Homan and Jason Roessner each tallied three touchdowns for Recovery.
Roessner also had an interception. Nothing unusual about Roessner's production.
He's played quarterback, running back, receiver, linebacker, safety and most
recently corner.

"He's willing to do anything to help us win and shows a lot of leadership that
way," Indians coach Brent Niekamp. "Everything is starting to come together and
it's the right time."

Minster lost 33-21 to Fort Recovery in Week 5 and has since mounted a six-game
win streak.

A Week 10 loss to St. Henry cost Fort Recovery home-field advantage in its
playoff opener. Niekamp credited that rugged MAC schedule for preparing the
Redskins for a playoff run.

" We didn't ( beat St . Henry), but we showed some signs that we were becoming
the team we want to be," Neikamp said. "We've been able to build on that the
last two weeks. I feel we've turned the corner and we're competing pretty well."

? Among the games that Time Warner Cable will televise this weekend are Wayne
vs. Pickerington Central at London at 11:30 p.m. Friday (delay) and
Trotwood-Madison vs. St. Mary's Memorial at 7 p.m. Saturday (live). Both games
can be seen on channels 1311 (HD), 311 and 99.

? What is the advantage to being a No. 1 regional seed? Everything. There were
28 top seeds spread over the seven divisions entering the playoffs and 15 will
play in regional finals. Also, 31 teams entered the postseason unbeaten and 15
remain.

? What do Upper Arlington, Akron Ellet, Wooster, Toledo Woodward, Norwood and
Mariemont have in common? All were 8-2 and didn't qualify for the playoffs.
Dresden Tri-Valley (9-1) was the most successful regular-season team that didn't
advance.

? Tickets are available at all participating schools. A percentage of the
presale proceeds are returned to each school.

Biblical scholar breaks down work in translating Hebrew

BYLINE: Lydia Nuzum Staff writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P3A

LENGTH: 639 words


Translation is always a work in progress, especially in the language Robert
Alter has dedicated much of his life to studying - Biblical Hebrew.

"I tell my students in all humility that translation is always a work in
progress; even published translations are works in progress, Alter said.
"Nothing is ever perfect in the translation. There is always the possibility
that you might figure out something just a little bit better.

Alter, emeritus professor of Hebrew and comparative literature and the founding
director of the Center for Jewish Studies at the University of California at
Berkeley, gave a lecture at the University of Charleston on Thursday night as
part of the West Virginia Humanities Council's McCreight Lecture series. The
talk focused on the history of the Bible in English, stretching from the King
James version to modern translations, including his own award-winning
translations of Genesis and the Five Books of Moses.

Alter's work has led him to translate parts of the Bible himself, but he has
also extensively studied the work of other translators. According to Alter, some
have done a good job of retaining nuances of the original Hebrew text, while
others have taken license that has impacted the meaning of some passages.

"It comes to be a matter of degree. That is, some translations have an awful lot
of work to do before they make any progress, and some are works in progress that
have moved toward some adequate representation of the original, he said.

Part of the problem, from Alter's view, is that early translators did not have
access to the realm of knowledge 21st-century scholars possess.

"If you go to Johns Hopkins or the University of Pennsylvania or Harvard or Yale
and complete a doctorate in biblical studies, you will learn many things the
King James translators did not know, he said. "You will learn Akkadian and
Ugaritic languages, which were only discovered in the late 19th and early 20th
century. You will have a much more rigorous and fine-tuned instruction on
Biblical literature and syntax.

Despite this, many of the King James translators possessed knowledge that modern
scholars forgo - they were well-versed in literature and prose of the period,
and many famous writers, including Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman and Herman
Melville, were influenced by the King James translation, Alter said.

Despite this, Alter said English can be a clunky language to translate Hebrew
into - lines that in the original Bible had three or four words and were
well-balanced become bulky in certain English translations. Alter is also
against what he calls "cosmetic heightening of translations - using words,
idioms and phrases that did not exist in the original text.

One example is in "Song of Songs, or "The Song of Solomon, he said. A line that
literally translates to "Her eyes are doves, is changed in a variety of ways:
"Thou has dove's eyes, reads the King James version, while the Jewish
Publication Society's translation reads "[You are fair] with your dove-like
eyes.

"Turning it into a simile when it is a beautiful metaphor blunts the beauty of
the metaphor, Alter said.

Alter is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the
American Philosophical Society, the Council of Scholars of the Library of
Congress, and a former president of the Association of Literary Scholars and
Critics. He has written widely on the European novel from the eighteenth century
to the present, and has published 24 works, including two prize-winning novels
on biblical narrative.

Robert Alter, Bible scholar and translator, speaks on "The History of the
English Bible" at the University of Charleston on Thursday. His speech was
sponsored by the West Virginia Humanities Council.

2003 Alter/SVSM title game on TWC

BYLINE: Marc F. Pendleton, Hamilton JournalNews, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 508 words


March 19--This week marks the 10th anniversary of Alter's Division II boys high
school basketball state championship loss to Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary and
LeBron James.

Time Warner Cable will reach into its vault and show that 2003 game at 7 o'clock
tonight (TWC Channel 311 and 1311 HD). Why? Because if both teams win their
Thursday state semifinals, they'll play for another title on Saturday in
Columbus.

Alter led that game 19-14 at halftime before the Irish rallied around you know
who for a 50-46 win. James scored 25 points and had 11 rebounds. Doug Penno led
the Knights with 12 points and Eric Laumann added 11.

It was a rematch of their regular-season game at the University of Dayton Arena,
which SVSM destroyed Alter 73-40. "The Chosen One" drew a sold-out crowd to UD
during a Sunday afternoon snowstorm in which residents were advised to stay
indoors.

A senior that season, it would be the third state title for SVSM during James'
career. Ironically, all three of those title games were against area teams:
Greeneview in 2000, Miami East in 2001 and Alter in 2003. Roger Bacon beat SVSM
in the 2002 final.

Alter (21-5) plays Columbus Watterson (26-1) at 8:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ohio
State University's Schottenstein Center. Akron SVSM (19-9) meets Warren (26-1)
at 5:15 p.m.

The D-II title game is 1:30 p.m. on Saturday, also at the Schott. All four
finals will be carried live on TWC Channel 99.

Realignment: A peewee football program has formed to mirror the Greater Miami
Conference. Dave Taylor, president of the Hamilton Jr. Blue Stars Youth Football
and Cheer Organization, reports that the Greater Miami Youth Football Conference
is now a reality.

The peewee league includes organizations that feed Hamilton, Fairfield,
Middletown, Sycamore, Lakota East and Lakota West. Taylor said Colerain and
Mason will join in 2014.

The GMYFC is for youths kindergarten through sixth grade and plays fall weekend
games.

Next level: Meghan Robinson, a 5-foot-9 forward from Madison, has committed to
play basketball for Miami-Middletown University. The senior averaged 3.7 points
and 2.1 rebounds for the Mohawks.

* Samantha Cash of Miami East will join teammate Allison Morrett in furthering
their volleyball careers at Tennessee Tech. Cash was first -team All-Ohio for
the Vikings following last season's Division III state title run. Both juniors
have verbally committed to the Golden Eagles of the Ohio Valley Conference.

* Alter senior Sarah Jansing has verbally committed to play soccer at Ursuline
College, an NCAA D-II program at suburban Cleveland.

It's an honor: Mason boys basketball coach Greg Richards is one of six winners
of the Bob Arnzen Award. He'll be honored by the Ohio High School Basketball
Coaches Association during the boys basketball state tournament on Saturday in
Columbus.

The award is for coaches who have spent 20 or more years coaching at the same
school.

Global league looks better each day

BYLINE: Jamie Wayne

SECTION: SECTION 4, INSIDE SPORT; Pg. 50

LENGTH: 626 words


  A week ago it was a longshot at best.

But the chances of the Global Hockey League facing off next autumn are improving
- every day.

A meeting in Los Angeles last week was a critical turning point. Six owners
purchased franchises, in: Los Angeles; Hamilton; Saskatoon; Albany, N.Y.;
Providence, R.I.; Sacramento, Calif.; Orange County, Calif.

Four others are said to be in the process of signing, including Laval, Que.,
Dallas, and Atlanta. Next month, in England, the league expects to add at least
six European-based clubs.

The league's plan is to:

Set up in mid-sized markets in North America and big cities in Europe;

Put the emphasis on speedy play by removing the centre line and eliminating
fights;

Practise fiscal restraint through salary caps of $2 million to $2.5 million.

Albany and Saskatoon have already started taking ticket orders and the league is
seeking TV deals in North America and overseas.

''We're not competing with the NHL,'' Barry Alter, part owner of the Hamilton
team, says. ''There's plenty of room out there in the sports marketplace and
we're going to try and identify our own niche.''

Alter's priority is to bring some Hamilton-based partners into his team. ''It's
essential for any team's long-term survival to have local support of private
individuals and corporations, '' he says.


Alter is trying to negotiate a lease with Hamilton's big arena, Copps Coliseum -
whose current mandate is to bring in an NHL team.


''We're not standing in the way of Hamilton getting an NHL team,'' Alter says.
''The NHL itself has said that it is not going to be expanding for at least
another two or three seasons. We don't see how filling empty dates in a
beautiful hockey facility is an impediment.''

A GHL franchise might help Hamilton get an NHL team.

''In a way, we're testing the waters for them,'' Alter says. ''If we do well the
NHL may look more carefully at this market than we hear they are.''

Alter, 34, played two years for the Baltimore Clippers - a Minnesota North Stars
farm team - and five years in Europe.

''It is a league philosophy to help make the players understand that hockey is a
business, getting involved in the community is very important and careers are
generally short. I didn't fully understand that when I played,'' Alter says.

One name that keeps popping up in connection with the Hamilton team is Brett
Hull, the NHL's leading goal scorer.

''Hull's next pro contract is going to be a huge one, perhaps as much as $1
million a year,'' Alter says. Hull is a free agent at the end of this season.
''With our salary caps you don't have to be a mathematician to realize it would
be tough to sign a Brett Hull and stay in business. But if he ends up signing
for a lot less, well . . . .''

But the GHL is not following in the defunct World Hockey Association's
footsteps. (The WHA signed Brett's father Bobby, then of the Chicago Blackhawks,
to get off the ground.)

''It is not imperative to sign a guy like that for our team or the league to
succeed. We'll survive if we're in the right markets and make our own
superstars.''

Another name being bandied about is 16-year-old sensation Eric Lindros, now
playing for the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League. Lindros is
eligible for the NHL entry draft after next season.

''He's not getting paid to play junior and he's risking injury every time he
steps in the ice. Why shouldn't he consider playing here next year?'' Alter
says.

But trying to sign Lindros should not be seen as a game plan to raid junior
hockey for underage players, he says.

''We'll draft players just like the NHL, at age 18. But Lindros is a special
opportunity, too good to pass up.''

Jolie's Halo rounds out heavenly Oaklawn field

BYLINE: Kane Webb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 12C

LENGTH: 345 words

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Ark.


Undefeated Jolie's Halo will be entered in Saturday's $ 500,000 Oaklawn
Handicap, but the first time he worked out on a racetrack, it didn't look like
he was destined for that kind of competition.

Trainer Happy Alter had the colt at Woodbine Racetrack in Canada last fall,
preparing him for his first race after some minor leg problems.

Under top Canadian jockey Robin Platts, the horse refused to extend himself in a
workout one morning.

''He wouldn't get out of an open gallop,'' said Alter.

He asked Platts to work Jolie's Halo again the next day.

''His agent didn't really think that he would come back,'' Alter said.

Alter put blinkers on the colt for the first and only time and breezed him in
company with a filly that recently had won a $ 12,000 claiming race.

At the end of the workout, the filly put her head in front of Jolie's Halo at
the finish line.

''See, Mr. Alter, you're too high on this horse,'' a member of Alter's crew
said. ''Here's a $ 12,000 filly that just outran him.''

''You think so?'' Alter retorted. ''You're going to be reading about this
horse.''

Months after that inauspicious start, 4-year-old Jolie's Halo has proved himself
one of the top horses in the country. He's a winner of six lifetime starts on
two surfaces over three tracks in two countries. He has a combined victory
margin of 15 lengths in his last three starts - the Appleton Handicap, Donn
Handicap and Gulfstream Park Handicap. The colt has earned $ 555,900 this year.

Saturday, Jolie's Halo will meet 1990 Kentucky Derby and Breeders' Cup winner
Unbridled and Santa Anita Handicap winner Farma Way in the Oaklawn Handicap. All
three are undefeated this year.

''Unbridled and Farma Way are fantastic horses - the best horses that they have
on this planet,'' Alter said. ''But Jolie's Halo might be from another planet.''

Oaklawn is the third leg of the 10-race American Championship Racing Series.
Jolie's Halo took the first event (the Donn), Farma Way the second (the Santa
Anita Handicap).

Boy, 9, reunites with Coast Guard rescuers

Boy, 9, reunites with Coast Guard rescuers

Tommy Alter never let go of his mom's hand on the walk across the tarmac.

The 9-year-old Highland Park boy shied away from all the cameras.

And he politely turned down an offer to step inside the helicopter -- the same
one that carried him away from a roughly 20-hour ordeal earlier this month on
Lake Michigan.

But one on one with his rescuers? And "scuba man?"

Tommy smiled. A lot.

"You were a trouper," said Kris Filion, the mission's flight mechanic.

The four-person Coast Guard crew made sure to put a shy Tommy at ease during a
reunion Tuesday at the Chicago Executive Airport in Wheeling.

"That's pretty much how we do it," said pilot Dan Schrader, admiring Tommy's toy
helicopter.

"I'm digging the shoes, bro," said Filion, gesturing to Tommy's nautical pair.

And then the group stepped over to the rescue basket -- the same one that lifted
Tommy from a kayak that had veered 10 miles off course in Door County,
Wisconsin.

There, next to the contraption, Leslie Alter hugged her son.

"He's a brave little man," dad Jay Alter said.

Tommy, his 9-year-old cousin and his aunt rented kayaks July 10. Tommy's older
sister and other relatives had kayaked the same waters near Peninsula State Park
earlier during the family vacation.

When the three didn't make it back by 4 p.m., employees at the rental business
called 911.

Crews searched through the night and turned up nothing. The water temperature
was a chilly 55 degrees.

Derek Johnson was sleeping at home when he got the call about 3 a.m. July 11.

He was two years out of the Coast Guard Academy as a rescue swimmer based in
Traverse City, Michigan. But he still hadn't logged a "live hoist," making him
the butt of playful jokes from veterans.

"We kind of bust on each other. Everyone wants to get their rescue, especially
in Traverse City," Johnson said. "It's a little more mild. It's not a big
search-and-rescue unit.

"We don't want them to happen, but it's also what we train for. We're glad to do
our jobs."

At sunrise, Johnson and three others took off aboard a Dolphin rescue
helicopter, combing the waters for any signs of the boys and the woman.

By the time the Dolphin was in the air, the Coast Guard had contacted the Royal
Canadian Air Force for a special plane equipped with infrared sensors -- devices
that could pick up body heat below.

The Canadian Hercules C-130 spotted the three the morning of July 11 -- about a
mile away from the Coast Guard helicopter.

The crew faced a new challenge: how to hover without tipping the kayaks over or
separating Tommy, who was lying down in one, and his aunt and cousin, sitting up
in the other.

"That rotor wash is pretty powerful," Filion said.

He was the eyes and ears for Schrader, who manned the controls, and command
pilot Shad Soldano. From the cockpit, Schrader and Soldano couldn't see much of
the rescue going on underneath the copter.

"I have to paint a visual picture for them and talk to them where we need to
be," Filion said. "That's amazingly hard."

In full-body gear, Johnson -- whom Tommy dubbed "scuba man" -- jumped into the
water. He swam over to the three and checked on their condition.

They were pale, a tad blue in the face and tired -- signs of mild hypothermia.
One by one, Johnson secured each into the basket. Tommy was first.

"I remember you using your feet to help (Johnson) paddle," Schrader said. "That
was a big help, so thank you for doing that."

The crew landed at the Menominee, Michigan, airport, and the survivors were
treated at a nearby hospital.

Schrader credited the aunt's quick thinking to tether the two kayaks together.
She also kept the boys, wearing life jackets, firmly seated in the kayaks and
out of the water.

"Most of the cases up here in the Great Lakes don't turn out so well because the
water's so cold," Soldano said. "They set themselves up for success."

But Coast Guard officials pointed out the group had nothing to communicate with
emergency responders and recommended boaters carry a personal locator beacon, a
handheld device that can send GPS coordinates to a satellite. Most cellphones
lose the signal a mile from shore.

Since his rescue, Tommy tinkered with his Legos and built a whole fleet of toy
helicopters, his way of processing the mishap, his mom says.

Tommy brought along a Lego helicopter, stamped with the Coast Guard's emblem,
for the reunion with the crew. His family treated all four members of the Coast
Guard to a late lunch of Chicago-style deep dish pizza.

"Thank you so much," Leslie Alter said.

David Alter, also known professionally as magician Dave King, passed away June
24. Dave was originally from Willard. Dave was an entertainer all his life.

He began studying and performing the art of magic while still in high school. A
graduate of Belen High School, David was co-valedictorian of his high school
class. Over many years, he toured with many traveling shows, working as a
magician, announcer, circus ringmaster, and for 12 years, Dave was known as "The
Voice of the Royal Lipizzaner Stallions" while serving as announcer for the
Royal Lipizzaner Stallion Show as they toured throughout the world, as well as a
two year engagement at Excalibur in Las Vegas, Nev. Dave brought much joy to
audiences around the world. Children especially loved Dave, and greatly enjoyed
his constant magic tricks and gags. He was respected in magic circles as well,
and also in the community of circus performers. Dave's Christian faith was

PENDLETON /

Posting an unbeaten regular season? In the mighty Greater Catholic League North
Division? No way, figured Alter girls high school basketball coach Chris Hart.

"We thought coming in that we were going to have a good team and do some really
solid things, but you don't ever plan on going undefeated," Hart said on Monday.

But that's just what the Knights have done. Unbeaten Alter joins Versailles and
Fort Loramie in this week's state final four at Ohio State University's
Schottenstein Center. The state semifinals in all four divisions are Thursday
and Friday. All four state title games are Saturday.

? Alter (28-0) plays unranked Toledo Rogers (24-4) in the first of eight state
semifinal games at 1 p.m. Thursday. Alter was No. 2 in the final Associated
Press state poll. It's the Knights' fifth trip to the state tourney and first
since placing runner-up in 2010.

It's the first final four for Rogers. Just as noteworthy, it's the first time
that Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown will not have played in a final four since
2006. The defending state champ, Brown won four state titles in that span.

"We've played (Brown) three different times in the final four," Hart said. "So,
it's weird not to have them there."

In Thursday's other D-II semifinal, top-ranked Millersburg West Holmes (27-0)
plays Akron SVSM (25-2) at 3 p.m.

? Versailles (23-3) drew Proctorville Fairland (22-3) in a 3 p.m. Friday D-III
semifinal.

Loaded with nine seniors, Versailles can go eight deep with players averaging
between 6-9 points.

"It makes it hard to coach," Tigers coach Jacki Stonebraker said, "because I
really don't know who to play until the second quarter hits. But it's hard for a
team to scout us because they've got so many different things written down for
each girl."

It marks Versailles' sixth time to the final four and first since 2009. The
Tigers won the D-III state title in 2008. Smithville (26-2) plays Columbus
Africentric (24-3) in the other 1 p.m. Friday semifinal.

? Loramie (26-2) has ridden Darian Rose to unprecedented success. A starter
since her freshman season, she's played in 108 varsity games, been to two finals
four and another regional final. Lo-ramie is the defending DIV state champion.

"I don't know how I'm going to function without (Rose), she's been here so
long," coach Carla Siegel said. "She's such a strong player and the girl doesn't
like to lose."

It's the fourth state final four in the last five years for Loramie and ninth
overall. Loramie will play top-ranked Reeds-ville Eastern (25-1) in a D-VI
semifinal at 8 p.m. on Thursday. In the other D-VI semifinal, it's Zanesville
Rosecrans (26-1) vs. Holgate (23-4) at 6 p.m. Thursday.

All of Saturday's state title games will be shown live on Fox sports except the
D-II game, which will air on TWC SportsChannel.

Eastmoor edges Alter out of tourney;
The Knights fall, 32-31, in the regional final despite shutting down opponent's
star.

BYLINE: By Ron Jackson Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 459 words


VANDALIA - Alter orchestrated an almost perfect defensive game plan against
highly touted Ayana Dunning.

The Knights had - well, just say they could've had better luck in the waning
seconds. Columbus Eastmoor Academy's Dunning, a tower of power and the nation's
top-rated junior center, rebounded a missed shot with 8.5 seconds to go and was
fouled. She converted two free throws with seven seconds left to carry her girls
basketball team to a thrilling 32-31 win.

The Warriors subsequently stole an Alter midcourt pass to snuff out the Knights'
state bid in the Division II regional final in front of 450 fans at the Vandalia
Butler Student Activity Center.

"I felt we had her (Dunning) boxed out by two of our girls there at the end, and
she went over our backs," said a disappointed Knights coach Chris Hart. "We did
everything we needed to do. I thought we did a great job on her all night,
fronting her and getting backside help."

Alter shackled Dunning for the most part. She finished with 13 points (only
three field goals) and 14 rebounds. A Who's Who of women's college basketball
covets the 6-foot-4 Dunning, who entered the game averaging 18 points and 14
rebounds. Notre Dame's Muffet McGraw scouted her in the semifinals, along with
reigning NCAA champs Maryland, Ohio State and Michigan State, to name just a
few. Dunning also hits free throws at a muchimproved 72 percent clip.

"I missed two free throws against Carroll last year here that cost us in the
regional semifinals," Dunning said. "I thought of that memory over and over. I
heard somebody from the crowd holler, 'Last year, Ayan'. I took a deep breath
and made sure I made them this time."

She exhaled and blew Alter out of the tournament. Dunning said the Knights'
smothering defense frustrated her, led by Moira Cummins, Louise VandenBosch and
Sarah Tahy.

"She's a target of gimmick defenses and gets banged up," said Eastmoor coach
James Miranda, whose team made state in 2005. "Big players deliver in big-time
situations, and Ayana rose to the occasion at the end."

Alter opened up an 11-2 lead that Eastmoor answered with an identical run. Their
15-13 lead was the Warriors' only advantage until Dunning's clutch free throws.
Alter outplayed and outhustled the Warriors.

"We got them in the bonus and put them on the line and that hurt us," Hart said.

Juniors Nicole Christie and Meghan Waterman led the Knights with 11 apiece.

Alter (23-2 and sixth in the final state poll) finished the season making its
fourth straight regional appearance and earning its sixth consecutive Girls
Greater Cincinnati League Grey title.

"This was a tight-knit group and one of the better seniorled teams we've ever
had here," Hart said.

Richard A. Greenawalt has been named president and chief operating officer of
the TSO Financial Corporation, a $1.2 billion financial institution that has
come far from its days as a loan service for Philadelphia teachers.

Mr. Greenawalt, 44 years old, comes to TSO from the presidency of the
Transamerica Financial Corporation, a unit of the Transamerica Corporation.
Before that he was with Citicorp for 15 years. At TSO he succeeds James Diamond,
who resigned in June.

Mr. Greenawalt was hired after a summerlong executive search, Dennis Alter,
chairman and chief executive of TSO, said. Mr. Greenawalt, who was not reachable
for an interview yesterday, will help TSO expand its nationwide financial
services, Mr. Alter said.

In a statement Mr. Greenawalt said, ''I view this as an extraordinary personal
opportunity to provide leadership and to contribute to the company's future
success.''

At Citicorp he was chairman and chief executive of Citicorp Person to Person
Inc., and before that he headed Citicorp Retail Services Inc. He is a graduate
of Drexel University in Philadelphia and holds an M.B.A. from Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.

TSO, which stands for Teachers Service Organization, was founded by Mr. Alter's
father, Jack, in the 1950's. Jack Alter, now 82, was an English and math teacher
for 20 years in the Philadelphia school system. ''That's a good background for a
banking business,'' his son said.

Jack Alter headed the company until he retired at age 65. TSO now makes loans to
the general public nationwide.

The company, based in the northern Philadelphia suburb of Horsham, made a major
expansion in 1982, when it bought Colonial National Bank U.S.A. In 1985 it went
public; it is traded over the counter. The Alter family still owns about 45
percent of the company.

Mr. Alter said the company hopes to have 600,000 customers by the end of next
year for its credit cards, installment loans, second mortgages and leases. Last
year TSO earned $8.4 million, or $1 a share, and it expects to earn $12 million,
or about $1.30 a share, this year. It solicits its business through the mail, by
telephone and on television.

Alter rallies to topple Tippecanoe

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 509 words


Jackie Bavaro's header with 25:39 remaining, on an assist from Carly Mygrants,
gave the Alter High School girls soccer team a hard-fought 4-3 nonleague win
over visiting Tippecanoe Saturday afternoon.

Battling through a minefield of hidden puddles and a 2-0 deficit, the Knights
improved to 6-2-1 overall.

"I'm proud of all of the girls, seniors included," Alter coach Sean Humenansky
said. "I mean, we were down 2-0, and to respond in the first half and end the
half ahead 3-2 - we really got back in the game."

Lauren Sharpe scored at the 32:55 mark in the first half - her 100th career goal
- and Kaitlyn Farmer followed with 31:49 remaining to stake the Red Devils to a
2-0 lead. Standing just past the midfield stripe, Farmer boomed an inbounds kick
that took one bounce and sailed to the back of the net.

Alter's Ashley Burgess started the Knights' comeback with a goal coming off a
rebound with 20:21 left in the first half. With just over 16 minutes to play,
Courtney Beinlich made a diagonal pass to Mygrants, who relayed it to Ann
Laschansky in front of Alter's goal. Laschansky scored to tie the game at 2.

With just :02 left in the half, Jen Hurtubise made a perfect corner kick to
Mygrants, who scored on a header to give the Knights a 3-2 lead.

Tipp's Courtney Brown halted Alter's momentum with a goal at the 26:27 mark in
the second half. But moments later, Bavaro, one of Alter's five seniors,
provided the game-winner.

Cross country

Cincinnati La Salle and Magnificat won the boys and girls team titles at the All
Ohio Catholic Championship at Indian Riffle Park in Kettering. La Salle and

St. John's swept the top three places, paced by winner Matt Lemon (16:23). Emily
Infeld of Cleveland Beaumont was the girls winner (18:38). Hilary Esselstein
paced runner-up Alter by placing fourth (20:00).

* Beavercreek's girls won the Tiger Invitational at Pickerington. Audrey
Holbrook (20: 40.97) and Jessika Olnhausen were third and fourth.

* Sam Borchers (17:10.46) , Evan Firestone and Andy Peters swept places 1-3 in
leading Yellow Springs to the boys team title at Bellbrook. Winner Darcy

Birmingham, Ala., invitational.

* Troy (girls) and Lima Shawnee (boys) won team titles at Sidney. Troy's Kristen
Altenburger, Sarah Langdon and Joanie Ma placed 1-2-3.

Veteran Alter boys taking shot

BYLINE: Dave Lamb

SECTION: CENTERVILLE BELLBROOK; Pg. Z2-14

LENGTH: 537 words


How do you follow the most successful baseball team in school history?

That's a daunting question that has faced the current crop of Alter High School
seniors.

Three years ago, Alter made its best tournament run, reaching the regional
final.

A stellar group of seniors, such as Bobby Getty, Paul Stone, Chris Jergens,
Jimmy Rose, Adam Waleskowski and others, finished their high school careers on
that lofty note.

The following spring, Alter coach Scott Balent turned over the reins to a group
of sophomores.

Seven of those players are now third-year varsity starters who are anxious to
further their own tournament success.

The veteran Knights have experienced a surprisingly topsyturvy season, but still
garnered enough respect to earn a fourth seed in the sectional tournament
despite an 8-9 record.

"They've already played seven tournament games," said Balent, now in his 12th
season. "They have experience."

Two years ago, they reached the sectional final before falling to Hamilton Badin
High School, 1-0.

Last season, Alter advanced to the district final, where the season ended again
with a one-run setback to Cincinnati McNicholas High School, 2-1.

Many of this year's games have been much wilder than those tournament
nail-biters.

On the upside, Alter exploded for a 17-7 win over McNicholas when the Rockets
were ranked first in Cincinnati. And in their first game against Centerville
High School since 1996, the Knights won, 14-7. On the downside, the Knights were
outlasted, 11-10, by Roger Bacon High School, a team that was saddled with a
2-16 record. Alter has shown they can score. Senior shortstop Michael Smith was
leading the way with a torrid .470 batting average midway through the season.
Seniors A.J. Shiverdecker and Taylor Neace both have hovered around the .400
mark. Defensively, who knows which team will show up in the tournament? "We
kicked the ball around," Balent said of the disappointing loss to Roger Bacon.
"But at times we're great defensively." Balent will have his answer today when
Alter faces the winner of the Eaton-Franklin first-round game.

Centerville swimmers help Raiders take title

With the help of several swimmers from Centerville, the Dayton Raiders won the
shortcourse Ohio Combined Team Championship for the first time in club history.

The Raiders took first place at the Ohio Senior Championships, which is for ages
15-18, and placed second at the championships for ages 14 and under.

With their combined point total at those meets, the Raiders claimed the combined
title over larger metropolitan area teams such as the Northern Kentucky
Clippers, Cincinnati Marlins and Upper Arlington Swim Club.

The team's senior girls won top honors and the senior boys placed third at the
Ohio Senior Championships that were held at the University of Toledo.
Centerville's Sara Castilano, 15, was among the individual first-place winners
at the senior meet. She won the 100 breaststroke. Beth Castilano, 15, swam on
the winning 800-freestyle relay. Allyson Kiracofe, 17, also of Centerville, swam
on five winning relay teams, including three freestyles and two medlies. At the
younger meet, Centerville's Austin Gregory, 11, won the 500 freestyle.

Alter back in title game;
Knights will try to atone for last year's championship loss.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL ALTER 53, WEST HOLMES 37

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 512 words


Hayley Combs of Alter (left) battles Alex Starr of West Holmes on Friday. Combs
scored 12 points.

Alter's Emma Bockrath comforts teammate Braxtin Miller, who didn't return to
play after suffering a leg injury in Friday's game.

COLUMBUS - The Alter girls basketball team couldn't close out an unbeaten season
in 2014, falling in the state championship. That wasn't the only incentive to
get it done this season.

"I remember coming back to the locker room and a West Holmes girl stopped me and
said you'll get it next year," Alter senior Emma Bockrath recalled. "She was
giving me support for this year."

Sure enough, Alter can do just that after beating Millersburg West Holmes 53-37
in a Division II state semifinal at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center on Friday.

Alter (29-0) will play Toledo Rogers (24-5) in today's 5:15 p.m. state
championship also at the Schott. Rogers advanced by eliminating Beloit West
Branch 51-37 in Friday's other semifinal. Alter edged Rogers 48-47 in the
regular-season Classic in the Country at Berlin Hiland.

For Alter this was a rematch of last year's state title game when West Holmes
overwhelmed the Knights 62-45 in a showdown of unbeatens. West Holmes had lost
the two previous state title games, which provided extra incentive for the
Holmes County team. This time it was Alter that had a season-ending crushing
loss on its collective mind.

"There was a lot of emotion coming into (this) game," said Bockrath, the D-II
player of the year who scored a game-high 23 points. "We remember last year and
how bad it felt to lose. We didn't want to feel that way again."

Flexing an average 5-inch advantage per player, Alter methodically took West
Holmes (24-4) out of its game. Alter's offense was humming and its defense was
lights out. The 14-point final margin was Alter's closest since handing
Springboro its first loss 10 games ago.

Hayley Combs added 12 points and four rebounds for the Knights and Libby Bazelak
was good for nine points and five rebounds. Maddie Bazelak had 10 rebounds.

The mood was tempered by the loss of Braxtin Miller to what appeared to be a
lower left leg injury. She collided with a West Holmes player and immediately
sank to the court and didn't return. She told coaches she expects to play today.

"We've played without kids all year," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "We have a
lot of different pieces and kids can play a lot of different roles and a lot of
different ways. Kids stepped up in ways that we would expect them to. We just
kept moving on."

Alter will be playing in its fourth state final since 2008 and second straight.
The Knights won their only state title in 2008.

It was the fourth straight final four for West Holmes.

"You can't have much of a bigger motivator than that," Holmes coach Lisa
Patterson said of last year's defeat of Alter. "It's no surprise that they're
moving on to the championship because of the caliber of team they have. They're
brute strength from top to bottom. They don't have a weakness."

HIGHLIGHT: The Laguna Beach resident is among 15 inducted into the inaugural
class of the National Sailing Hall of Fame.


Laguna Beach's Hobie Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame
recently at an invitation-only ceremony at the San Diego Yacht Club.

Alter was one of 15 inductees to the inaugural class.

Alter is widely known as the man behind the development of the
foam-and-fiberglass surfboard. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling
surfboard brands. He is also the creator of the Hobie Cat sailboat, the Hobie 33
ultralight-displacement sailboat and one of the finest mass-produced
radio-controlled gliders, the Hobie Hawk.

Alter opened Southern California's first surf shop in Dana Point in the 1950s.
Then in 1958, he and his buddy Gordon "Grubby" Clark (as in Clark Foam) began
experiments making surfboards out of foam and fiberglass.

"After years of planning, we are so pleased that the heroes of our sport are
getting their long-overdue recognition," said Dick Franyo, president of the
National Sailing Hall of Fame, in a press release. "The National Sailing Center
and Hall of Fame will be a place to honor these heroes and provide inspiration
for all sailors - young and old."

The inductees are U.S. citizens 45 and older who have made a significant impact
on the growth and development of the sport in the United States, in categories
of Sailing, Technical and Contributor. Nominations of noncitizens were also
considered if they influenced the sport, and posthumous nominations were also
accepted.

Alter - who is also on the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame - is one of five
inductees from California. The others include four-time America's Cup winning
skipper Dennis Conner (San Diego); 1968 Star Olympic gold medalist and founder
of North Sails Lowell North (San Diego); 1998 Whitbread Round the World Race
winning skipper Paul Cayard (Kentfield) and single-handed circumnavigator and
noted writer Joshua Slocum (San Francisco).

W.N.B.A. Adds Team In Chicago

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

SECTION: Section D; Column 1; Sports Desk; BASKETBALL; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 480 words


Chicago has been awarded a W.N.B.A. franchise for the 2006 season, N.B.A.
Commissioner David Stern announced yesterday.

The new team will be owned and operated by Michael Alter, a commercial real
estate developer, and a group of minority owners. Alter said he had agreed to
pay $10 million for the franchise.

''This is my first involvement in a sports franchise,'' said Alter, adding that
he had become interested in owning a team after meeting several players in the
Women's National Basketball Association at last year's N.B.A. All-Star Game in
Los Angeles.

''As a private investor, we think this gives us a strong advantage in having an
independent operation,'' he said. ''We had a great model in terms of what we put
together and the cost structure we need, and we feel very confident this will be
a viable financial investment.''

The Chicago team will be the second W.N.B.A. club that has no affiliation with a
National Basketball Association team. The Connecticut Sun is owned by the
Mohegan Tribe, which owns and operates the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville.

In a teleconference call from Chicago, Stern called the addition of the Chicago
franchise, the W.N.B.A.'s 14th team, a good step.

''As the W.N.B.A. enters its ninth year, the prospects for the future have never
been brighter, which is why we are attracting independent entrepreneurs like
Michael Alter to invest in the league's expansion,'' Stern said. ''We are
dealing with a sophisticated investor who has done a lot of work, meeting with
all our existing franchises, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, start-up
costs and competing costs.''

The team, which has not been named, will join the Eastern Conference and play
its home games at the 7,500-seat Illinois-Chicago Pavilion.

The W.N.B.A. began play in 1997 with eight teams: New York, Charlotte, Cleveland
and Houston in the East, and Los Angeles, Phoenix, Sacramento and Utah in the
West. In 1998, Detroit and Washington joined the league, followed by Minnesota
and Orlando in 1999. In 2000, the W.N.B.A. expanded to 16 teams with Indiana,
Miami, Portland and Seattle joining the league.

In 2002, the N.B.A. Board of Governors voted to change the league's business
model to individual ownership from a single-entity structure and to allow
W.N.B.A. teams to be operated outside N.B.A. markets. Orlando, Miami and
Portland immediately ceased operations, and Utah relocated to San Antonio.
Before the start of the 2003 season, Orlando relocated to Connecticut. By the
end of the 2003 season, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced they would no longer
operate their W.N.B.A. counterpart, the Rockers.

Although the W.N.B.A. has not made a profit, Stern said the league had
solidified financially and was looking toward further expansion.

''I would expect we would do a new franchise in 2007 and probably 2008,'' he
said.

An Alter-ed Perspective on the Bible;
profile

BYLINE:

Anthony Weiss lives and writes in Los Angeles.

SECTION: Arts & Culture; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1294 words


As this year marks the 400th  anniversary of the King  James Version of the
Bible,  a new English translation  might seem a bit late to the game.  After
all, the KJV is justly celebrated  for its eloquence, and the shelves  are
packed with more recent translations,  such as that of the Jewish  Publication
Society, that draw on  modern advances in linguistic and  historical scholarship
and are written  in more contemporary English.

But Robert Alter sees problems  with all these translations, which  he describes
in the introduction to  his own 2004 rendering of the Five  Books of Moses:
Broadly speaking,  one may say that in the case of the  modern versions, the
problem is a  shaky sense of English and in the  case of the King James Version,
a  shaky sense of Hebrew.

Alter argues that the KJV is frequently  inaccurate, and that both  the King
James and its successors  fail to convey in English the refined  narrative style
and linguistic rhythms  of the Hebrew original. It is an argument  that is all
the more persuasive  because it is backed by groundbreaking  contemporary
scholarship on the  literary artistry of the Bible  namely,  his own.

Even to the untrained reader, Alter's  translations are both familiar and
startlingly different. The language is  simple, vigorous and rhythmical, and
Alter prefers concrete, often tactile  metaphors to the more philosophical
renderings of other translators. Thus,  in Psalm 63, where both the KJV  and the
New JPS translate the poet  as declaring that his soul thirsts  for God, Alter
translates nefesh as  throat, rejecting an abstract term  in favor of an image
rooted in the trials  of desert life.

The resulting text stands as a fresh

reminder that the authors of the  Bible were not lawyers or philosophers  but
desert tribesmen living in  a stark and often brutal world.

Alter himself, by contrast, is a  courtly presence with a bushy halo  of white
hair and an easy manner   a genial genius, one friend calls  him  that belies
his intellectual  heft.

He is the most accomplished  Jewish humanist in America, said  Leon Wieseltier,
a longtime friend of  Alter's and literary editor of The New  Republic, to which
Alter is a periodic

contributor.

Alter says that he stumbled into

his career as a biblical translator, but  it is, in many ways, the unification
of  twin passions that Alter has pursued  most of his life: literary
scholarship,  and Hebrew language and culture.

Like many formative love affairs,  Alter's romance with Hebrew began  during his
adolescence, in post-bar  mitzvah classes in his hometown  of Albany and at Camp
Ramah in  Wisconsin. By the time he arrived  in New York City in the 1950s to
attend Columbia University, he was  already conversationally fluent. He  chose
Columbia, in part, so that he  could pursue his Jewish education at  the
neighboring Jewish Theological  Seminary.

JTS was, at the time, the leading  institution in the country for  Jewish
studies, and Alter studied  the Hebrew Bible, Talmud and

Midrash with some of the best  scholars of the day  all in classes  conducted in
Hebrew. His Bible  teacher, H. L. Ginsberg, was one of  the primary editors of
the New JPS  translation, which was published  over two decades, starting in
1962.

Alter also decided, on his own, to master  literary Hebrew, reading novels and
quizzing himself with Hebrew vocabulary  flashcards as he rode the bus to
afternoon  track practice. As a result, Alter recalled,  I really acquired all
the different historical  strata of the language.

Meanwhile, at Columbia, and subsequently  at graduate school at Harvard,  Alter
studied under some of the most eminent  literary critics of the day, including
Lionel Trilling, F. W. Dupee and Reuben  Brower. Many of these critics were
disciples  of New Criticism, a mode of literary  study that emphasized close
reading  of texts as self-contained entities  an  approach that would later have
a deep  influence on Alter's own study of the  Bible.

In 1967, Alter moved to California to take  a professorship in Hebrew and
comparative  literature at University of California,  Berkeley. Much of his
scholarly work has  focused on European literature and writers,  including
Kafka, Stendhal and the  picaresque novel  in addition to extensive  writings
about modern Hebrew  literature.

It was not until the mid-1970s that Alter  turned his literary gaze to the
Bible.

I knew biblical narrative was great, but  I didn't know why, Alter said. It
seemed  so barebones and ostensibly simple.

At that time, most modern biblical scholarship  had focused on source criticism:
using linguistic patterns to figure out  which parts of the Bible were compiled
from different historical sources and trying  to analyze the differences between
those  sources. Alter, however, drawing on his  training with the New Critics,
turned his  attention to the literary techniques that  recur throughout the
Bible  the repetition  of key words, the reticence of the  narrator, subtle
variations on conventional  scene types  and unite the text into a  powerful
whole.

The resulting 1981 study, The Art of  Biblical Narrative, and its subsequent
1985 companion, The Art of Biblical  Poetry, revolutionized the way that
scholars  read the Bible.

It was a revelation for people in the  field of biblical studies, said Ron
Hendel,  Alter's colleague and friend at UC Berkeley.  All of a sudden, the
literary study of Bible,  which barely existed prior to that, was a
full-fledged, mature and compelling avenue  of inquiry. And he taught everybody
how to do it.

Alter's scholarship also led, indirectly,  to his translation work. Several
years  after The Art of Biblical Poetry was published,  an editor at W. W.
Norton asked  Alter to do a critical edition of either  Kafka or a book of the
Bible. Alter picked  Genesis, but, dissatisfied with all the existing
translations, he decided to translate  it himself.

Alter says that he expected the translation  to be a one-off experiment, but it
turned out to be a rather closer approximation  of my fantasies than I assumed
it  was going to be.

It was also a hit, and Alter was persuaded  to continue translating additional
books  until, he said, I had become, willy-nilly,  a highly visible translator
of the Bible.

To date, Alter has translated roughly  half of the Hebrew Bible, most recently
the Wisdom Books of Job, Proverbs  and Ecclesiastes (or Qohelet, in Hebrew),
which was released in paperback by W. W.  Norton & Company in October. His work
has drawn rave reviews in virtually every  major English-language publication on
both sides of the Atlantic, with praise from  literary luminaries such as Harold
Bloom  and Seamus Heaney.  Extensive scholarly notes accompany allof

Alter's translations, and it is here thatAlter  says he most deeply connects to
histranslation  as a Jewish, rather than a literary,  endeavor.

Commentary is the Jewish mode ofexpression  par excellence, Alter said.  I've
come to feel that there is a certainway  in which, in pushing ahead withthis
enterprise, I've become a colleagueof  Rashi and Ibn Ezra and the Ramban.

Alter is 76, and he retired recently fromhis  post at UC Berkeley, though he
remainsin  good health and is still an avid tennisplayer.  He is currently
working on a translation  of the Former Prophets (Joshua,  Judges, Samuel and
Kings), which heexpects  to send to his publisher in thespring  of 2012 and to
publish in 2013. After that, he expects to continue on tothe  major prophets
Isaiah, Jeremiah,  and Ezekiel  if, as he said, I remain ingood  health and
enthusiastic.

Alter says that he is often asked if heintends  to translate the entire
HebrewBible.  The answer, he explains with a wrysmile,  is not entirely in his
own hands: That's basically an actuarial question.

Sky struggling to stand out in Chicago;
Lack of ties to NBA's Bulls slows progress

BYLINE: Akilah Laster

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 12C

LENGTH: 540 words


The Chicago Sky face the usual expansion team hardships -- financial setbacks,
lackluster fan support, marketing struggles and a losing record.

The Sky also have to cope with being the only WNBA team in an NBA city with no
ties to that city's NBA team.

"Breaking through with your message of who you are and what you are in a new
market is the biggest obstacle," says Michael Alter, principal owner of the Sky.

The Sky do not share facilities with the Chicago Bulls, unlike former expansion
teams such as the Seattle Storm, who use the NBA/WNBA business model, and the
Washington Mystics, who have non-NBA affiliated ownership but share the Verizon
Center with the Washington Wizards. The Sky play in the University of Illinois
at Chicago Pavilion.

"It would certainly have been nice to walk into something. It would've saved us
a lot of time and money," says Alter. "It took us a lot of time to build an
infrastructure, which we certainly would not have had to do if we were a part of
the NBA team."

Alter purchased the Sky for $10 million. The Chicago native is president of the
Alter Group, a commercial real estate company.

The Sky, whose marquee players include rookie of the year candidate Candice
Dupree and Stacey Dales, the No.3 overall pick in 2002, have worked to make
themselves a name, doing several public appearances.

Alter and WNBA President Donna Orender see one advantage in Chicago's situation.

"It provides a very focused model," Orender says. "With NBA/WNBA models, you
have to choose 'Well, which one are we going to focus on today?'"

"We think it's great to have our sole purpose to be to promote and make the WNBA
team successful," Alter says.

Attendance is a concern leaguewide, dipping to about 8,200 per game entering the
season. The Sky, in a 6,900-seat arena, average slightly more than 3,000.
Winning cured lagging attendance in Seattle and Detroit, but Chicago has a
league-worst 4-23 record.

"We just have to keep working hard and keep our heads up," says Dupree, who had
a career-high 25 points in a 69-64 loss to the Indiana Fever on Sunday.

Sports television consultant Neal Pilson says it is important for any league to
have teams in major markets. Chicago is the No.3 TV market in the USA.

"You give the perception that the league is a 'big league,'" says Pilson. "The
major markets are where sponsors and advertising offices are ... and if you do
well in the major markets, your ratings around the country are stronger. With
the total number of households between New York, Chicago, and L.A., you have
more than 10% of the country."

The Connecticut Sun, who had to overcome non-NBA affiliated barriers en route to
winning back-to-back Eastern Conference titles, advise the Sky to stay the
course.

"It's really about fixing and maintaining," says Sun general manager Chris
Sienko. "Every year they're going to do better and better based upon the
feedback they get from their fans and supporters."

Chicago officials have given themselves three to five years to turn a profit or
become a winning team, says Alter.

"I'm not sure those things are going to happen in the same time frame," Alter
says. "Turning a profit isn't going help us become a better team, and I don't
think we need to be a winning team to turn a profit."

Researcher Reports Evidence of a New Type of Hepatitis Virus

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN,   Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section A;  Page 15;  Column 1;  National Desk

LENGTH: 459 words

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md., Jan. 10


A Federal scientist said today that his team had found preliminary evidence of a
new virus that is believed to cause a new type of hepatitis.

The newly reported virus can apparently be transmitted through blood
transfusions, said the scientist, Dr. Harvey J. Alter of the National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda. He disclosed the finding at a scientific meeting on blood
transfusions.

It would be the second new type of hepatitis virus reported in recent months.
Late last year, a team of researchers in France reported finding a virus that
they say causes a sixth type of hepatitis. But the finding of a hepatitis F
virus, as they called it, has not been confirmed. In an interview, Dr. Alter
said he was "a bit skeptical about the finding because it came out of the blue."

Particles of what may be a new virus were detected from one of the unexplained
cases of transfusion hepatitis in the institutes' collection, Dr. Alter said.
His team is now trying to identify the virus further by using the latest
molecular biology techniques on blood and other tissues from additional cases.

"It is a not a proven virus, and the finding could fall through," Dr. Alter
said. His team is not ready to publish data on the virus, he said.

He said he disclosed the finding reluctantly because he was addressing a
federally appointed panel that had been summoned to hear all information
concerning infectious agents that could be spread through blood transfusions. On
Wednesday, the committee is to recommend whether certain tests should be added
or dropped in screening blood for transfusions.

"I wanted the committee to know that there may be something new on the horizon,"
Dr. Alter said.

Preliminary evidence suggests that the possible new virus is not a big public
health threat, but that is not known for sure because no test has been developed
yet, Dr. Alter said. His team is working with Genelabs of Redwood City, Calif.
to develop a screening test.

Dr. Alter said his team's virus would be called either hepatitis G virus or
hepatitis F virus, depending on whether there was confirmation of the viruses in
France and here.

Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver, and many chemicals and infectious
agents can cause it. The various viruses known to cause the disease are called
hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. American blood is tested routinely for B and C, the
types of virus that were most commonly transmitted through blood.

The latest improved version of the test for hepatitis C has virtually eliminated
the virus from transfusions, Dr. Alter reported.

"So it would appear that any new virus has got to account for a very tiny piece
of the picture" in the United States, he said. But such viruses could be more
common elsewhere.

Alter awaits rematch against Bishop Hartley;
Coaches still recall heartbreaking loss in 2010 semifinals.;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: ; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 675 words


Devon Smith and his Trotwood-Madison teammates earned their seventh straight
trip to the state semifinals by defeating St. Marys Memorial.

Most members of the Alter High School football coaching staff finally forced
themselves to watch the replay of a 2010 loss to Columbus Bishop Hartley over
the weekend. Some results are best left alone, especially when they're decided
in the final minute on a 2-point conversion.

"Until this weekend, most of our coaches couldn't bring themselves to watch the
film from 2010," Alter coach Ed Domsitz said of the 29-28 Division IV state
semifinal setback. "It still hurts."

Alter (13-0) and Hartley (11-2) will renew a playoff rivalry in the D-IV high
school football state semifinals at London on Friday. Joining Alter in reaching
Week 14 games are Trotwood-Madison (D-III) and Midwest Athletic Conference reps
Cold-water (D-V), Marion Local (D-VI) and Minster (D-VII).

The Ohio High School Athletic Association announced neutral-site game locations
on Sunday. State semifinal winners advance to next week's season-ending state
championships in Columbus.

Alter posted its second straight defensive gem by defeating high-scoring
Cincinnati Wyoming 35-7 in a regional final last week. Hartley, the defending
D-IV state champ, edged Western Buckeye League representative Ottawa-Glandorf
38-35.

Midsized powers have had remarkable success at the highest level. Hartley also
won a state title in that 2010 season and was a state runner-up in '13. This
will be the Hawks' fifth straight state semi appearance and sixth in the last
seven seasons. Alter has won two state titles and was the 2014 runner-up.

Hartley lost close games to Toledo Central Catholic (D-III) and Columbus St.
Francis DeSales (D-III), both of which are 13-0 and also playing in state semis.

"It's going to be a major challenge," Domsitz said. "I told the kids you better
not pay attention to those two losses. This is a top-level, state
championship-caliber team."

? Trotwood eliminated another WBL team in St. Marys Memorial on Saturday night
at Piqua, 34-27. The Rams (11-2) also will renew a playoff rivalry against
defending D-III state runner-up Toledo Central Catholic (13-0) at Lima Spartan
Stadium on Saturday. TCC has ended Trotwood's season three times in the last
five years, including the 2012 D-II state title game.

R a m s r u n n i n g b a c k Raveion Hargrove matched his season high with 212
yards rushing and touchdowns against St. Marys, propelling them into a seventh
straight state semifinal.

"This means a lot," said Hargrove, who's rushed for 531 yards and scored seven
touchdowns in Trotwood's three playoff wins. "It lets you know all the hard work
and sacrificing we did all summer has paid off."

? The MAC remains in contention for three teams to reach championship weekend,
which has happened the last two seasons. Marion Local (12-1) will play Hamler
Patrick Henry (13-0), also at Lima on Friday. On Saturday, four-time defending
D-V state champ Coldwater (12-1) will play Coshocton (12-1) at Lewis Center
Olentangy, and Minster (9-4) faces McComb (12-1) at Wapakoneta.

Coldwater has won 23 straight playoff games since 2012, and a win ties Marion
Local for the longest postseason winning streak in playoff history.

? Four defending state champs are in in contention: Cincinnati La Salle (D-II),
Akron Hoban (D-III), Hartley (D-IV) and Coldwater (D-V). Defending state champs
who were knocked out last week were Lakewood St. Edward (D-I), Kirtland (D-VI)
and Fort Recovery (D-VII).

? Wayne and Colerain appeared headed for a D-I state semifinal showdown like
last year. Instead, it's Cincinnati St. Xavier (8-5) vs. Pickerington Central
(12-1). St. X advanced with its second straight OT win. Central stunned Wayne
17-14 on a last-play field goal. Wayne (11-1-1) had fallen in the last two D-I
state title games and three since 2010.

? Tickets are available at participating schools. A portion of presale proceeds
are returned to schools.

IT'S SHOWDOWN TIME;
Defending state champ Alter faces unbeaten Tippecanoe.

BYLINE: By Chick Ludwig Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 349 words


There probably won't be a soul on the streets of Tipp City come 7:30 tonight,
March 13.

Alter High School hoops fanatics will likewise flee Dayton's south suburbs and
flock to Vandalia.

The girls high school basketball game the Miami Valley has waited patiently for
all season long has finally arrived.

Tippecanoe (25-0), the No. 1-ranked team in the state, faces Alter (23-2), the
2008 state champion, for the Division II regional title at the Vandalia Butler
Student Activity Center.

The winner earns a berth in the OHSAA State Girls Basketball Championships,
March 19-21, at the Schottenstein Center on the Ohio State campus.

"I'm sure there will be nerves on both sides," Alter coach Chris Hart said.
"Hopefully, we'll play through that and make a game of it."

"Even though we're ranked No. 1 in the state," Tippecanoe coach Todd Varvel
said, "we're kind of the underdogs because they're the defending state champs."

Alter has more height with four 6-footers to the Red Devils' one. But Tippecanoe
has more experience with six seniors to the Knights' three.

Nevertheless, both teams possess tremendous depth, talent and leadership.
Tippecanoe senior guard Abby Dowd vs. Alter junior guard Ashley Christie is one
of the matchups to watch.

The Knights have won seven straight. Their only losses came against visiting
Chaminade Julienne (48-47) on Dec. 15 and Boone County, Ky., (52-48) on Feb. 7
in the Centerville Shoot-Out.

"We've not had the real high high or the real low low," Hart said. "Our kids
have stayed pretty steady, pretty calm, all year. That's just their demeanor. We
have to really make sure that defensively, we don't have any lapses, and we're
going to have to handle their pressure."

Unblemished Tippecanoe has been a model of consistency all year.

"But Alter has, too," Varvel said. "They've played a tough schedule. It's going
to come down to who takes care of the basketball, who's able to score when the
opportunities come and who's able to get stops. We just have to believe in
ourselves and bring our 'A' game."

"Just amazing."

Such was outside hitter Rachel Billing's reaction after her Anna Rockets won the
Division III state high school volleyball title Saturday, unseating defending
champion Cleveland Villa Angela-St. Joseph at the Nutter Center.

It's the first volleyball title for the Rockets, who finished 30-0 and were
welcomed home with a parade.

In D-II, Alter earned its third state title, beating Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit
in four games.

Despite 17 kills each from Nicole Wright and Alycia Niemeyer, New Knoxville
bowed to Norwalk St. Paul in the DIV final.

Soccer: Alter's boys ran into a Walsh Jesuit buzzsaw, losing 2-0 in the D-II
championship at Columbus Crew Stadium.

Football: Continuing its DIII playoff march, Alter thrashed Eaton, 49-0. St.
Marys Memorial lost, 34-20, to Sunbury Big Walnut, which faces Alter next. St.
Henry (D-V) beat Marion Pleasant, 27-0, to advance.

BigGameFever;
Community rallies around Alter for state semifinal game

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 295 words


With his 6-foot-8, 310-pound son as an all-district offensive lineman, Gail
Plunkett has paid particular attention to the Alter High School football team in
the past few seasons. A major difference this season lies in the number of
people watching Max Plunkett and his teammates.

"There are some people who weren't football fans two years ago," Plunkett said.
"There are more fans now. I think they can sense the team feels they have a job
to finish."

Two steps away from the state championship that eluded it two years ago, Alter
will face Genoa Area today, Nov. 21, in a Division IV state semifinal football
game at Findlay's Donnell Stadium.

The matchup begins an emotional weekend for Miami Valley football fans, as Ohio
State will host arch rival Michigan at noon Saturday.

Of the two, Alter has the more direct route to a championship. The 11-2 Knights
have stormed through the playoffs as they did two years ago, when they lost the
state championship game 34-33 to Steubenville.

That same school is playing in the other D-IV semifinal, which means Alter could
find itself in a championship rematch Nov. 28 in Canton .

First, Alter must defeat 13-0 Genoa Area from near Toledo, and Knights
supporters expect a good number of Alter fans despite the 114-mile drive to
Findlay.

"We get a lot of people who don't have any kids on the team," Plunkett said.

Alter ego claim proceeds outside bankruptcy, rules California Court of Appeal

BYLINE: Pat Murphy

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 244  words


The automatic stay in a corporation's bankruptcy case did not prevent its owner
from being sued by a creditor in state court under an alter ego theory, the
California Court of Appeal has ruled in affirming a $292,000 judgment.

The plaintiff provided goods to the defendant's corporation. When its invoices
were not paid, the plaintiff sued the defendant and his corporation. According
to the plaintiff, the defendant was individually liable for the unpaid invoices
under an alter ego theory.

When the corporation later filed for bankruptcy, the defendant contended that
the plaintiff's alter ego claim was the property of the bankruptcy estate.

But the court concluded that the bankruptcy filing did not stay the plaintiff's
alter ego lawsuit because, under state law, the corporation did not have a
corresponding right of action against the defendant.

The court explained that the plaintiff "did not seek to assert a right of action
belonging to the corporation. [The defendant] has not argued that the alter ego
allegations constituted a substantive right of action belonging to the
corporation. We hold that [the plaintiff's] claims based on alter ego liability
were not the property of [the corporation's] bankruptcy estate, and therefore,
the action was not subject to the automatic stay of the bankruptcy proceedings.
"

Alter loses winning touch;
Third quarter run by Eastmoor leads to 45-40 win

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi mgokavi@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 496 words


VANDALIA - Picked last in its league, the Alter girls basketball team had a shot
at a Division II regional final.

Unfortunately for the Knights, getting enough shots to fall didn't happen
Tuesday night at the Student Activity Center.

Columbus Eastmoor Academy wrestled control with a 12-0 thirdquarter run and hung
on for a 45-40 victory. The Warriors (23-2) play Cincinnati Roger Bacon (23-2)
here at 7:30 p.m. Friday for a berth in the state tournament.

With a revamped lineup, the Knights exceeded expectations.

"They proved everybody wrong all year," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "It was
because of the seniors. They were determined to have a good senior season.

"We had no superstar. We just worked really hard. I think we kind of shocked the
world with what we accomplished."

Alter (18-6) nearly shocked state No. 5-ranked Eastmoor. Alter trailed 10-3
after one quarter but tied the game at 16 early in the third.

But Alter missed 3-pointers (0 for 12 overall), made 10 turnovers and just one
Louise VandenBosch field goal in the third quarter. The Knights also had only
one field goal in the first quarter.

"We didn't shoot the ball very well," Hart said. "We haven't shot like that all
year."

Eastmoor got points from four players during a 12-0 third-quarter streak for a
28-16 lead.

"We knew they'd make a run," Hart said. "We thought they may make two runs.
That's what they do. We were prepared for that. We had talked about that in
practice. We knew we had to weather that and climb back in it."

Alter repeatedly got within six points. Each time, either Ayrizanna Favours (14
points), Ayana Dunning (9), Cherise Daniel (9) or Teresa Scott (8) would respond
with a bucket or steal.

"Our pressure and our intensity creates our momentum," Eastmoor coach Jim
Miranda said. "Getting those turnovers and fastbreak opportunities is a large
part of our game."

Eastmoor was 6 of 15 from the line in the fourth quarter, helping Alter stay
close. But a bad pass, 3-second call or missed shot cost Alter chances to make
it a one-possession game.

"It was just a lot of little things," Hart said. "We executed at the end of the
game pretty well. A break here or there ..."

VandenBosch scored 12 of her game-high 17 points in the fourth. Caitlyn Mauch
and Kristen Stichweh each added eight.

The Knights controlled tempo. Alter also forced several turnovers and put the
right people on the free line at crunch time. But too many shots rolled off the
rim or bounced out.

"They were right there," Hart said. "It was one of those nights, I guess."

* Cin. Roger Bacon 52, Little Miami 50: Heather Hausfeld had 20 points and
Jessica Hoeh 16 as Bacon made just enough plays. Tied at 47 with 1:38 left,
Bacon made one foul shot and added a Sara Faller bucket and two more free throws
while Little Miami's Jessie Carmack hit a 3-pointer. The teams combined for 47
fouls and hit 32 of 58 foul shots. Little Miami (20-4) was led by Missy Ramsey's
14 points and Carmack's 12.

ARVILLA ALTER;
 TEACHER, WIFE OF UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR

SECTION: LOCAL & STATE, Pg. 5B

LENGTH: 345 words

DATELINE: DENVER


Arvilla Alter, 90, died here Dec. 30, 1997, two years after suffering a stroke.

Born in Portland, Maine, she graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in
1928 and taught in junior college until she married.

Mrs. Alter was known as ''the first lady of the University of Denver'' for her
cheerful and unwavering service there.

She came to Denver in 1953 when her husband, Chester Alter, was named
chancellor.

Mr. Alter, 91, recalled those years fondly Wednesday. ''Someone calculated that
we either entertained or were entertained 26 nights a month for 15 years,'' he
said. ''She was wonderful at it.''

Whether entertaining Denver's wealthy and powerful or teaching English to
children in Malaysia, Mrs. Alter enjoyed meeting new people from all walks of
life.

It's difficult for young people to appreciate how much was expected of a
chancellor's wife back then, said Rike Wooten, a retired Denver stockbroker and
friend.

''The wife of a chancellor was the hostess-with-the-mostest (and) took care of
everything,'' including students, visiting dignitaries and world leaders, Wooten
said. ''And their home wasn't literally their home - it was the university's
home. It was like the White House, with a private part and public part.''

Mrs. Alter was ''a very gracious lady, a very warm and loving person,'' said
Wooten.

After her husband retired in 1967, the Alters signed on with the Internal
Executive Service, spending time in South Korea, Malaysia and Brazil. He advised
college officials; she taught youngsters.

Mrs. Alter did charity work for Goodwill and other organizations, and was active
in Denver's oldest women's club, the Monday Literary Club, now in its 130th
year.

Well into her 80s, she volunteered at the DU Women's Library Association annual
book sale and was an ardent supporter of university sports.

Surviving, besides her husband, are a son, Dr. Richard Alter of Modesto, Calif.;
a grandson, Hugh D. Alter of St. Louis; and stepgrandchildren Summer and Van
Wray, both of California.

A private service was held.

Real estate veteran is self-proclaimed 'deal junkie'

BYLINE: Ezra Fieser

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 803 words


Thirty years later and still a "deal junkie."

After ditching a law career in favor of real estate and then ditching his
father's investment real estate business for a job with Manekin, Richard Alter
-- even after leading Manekin Corp. through a now dismantled merger and the ups
and downs of commercial real estate -- prides himself on his ability to put a
deal together.

From inking a lease in the 1970s at The Rotunda for the then controversial
Maryland Lottery Commission to helping regain control of Manekin Corp. in 2001
from a $4 billion national real estate investment trust, Alter's nose for the
deal has been an integral part of Manekin's development.

"Lou La Penna, the COO, day in and day out runs the administrative parts of the
company and does a great a job. I still tend to be a deal junkie," Alter said.
"I'm getting too old to be a deal junkie, but I like looking for new business.
So I'm still out there. ... It's who I am."

He joined the Columbia-based company in 1971 as a salesman. As one of 10 to 15
employees, much of his introduction to the world of real estate came from the
Manekin brothers, namesakes of the company.

"It was all on the job training," Alter said. "It was really working with the
senior Manekins, ... going out and seeing what other people had done, but it was
absolutely OJT."

The 58-year-old was familiar with the Baltimore market. Growing up in the Mount
Washington neighborhood, Alter was a product of the public school system in
Baltimore.

He graduated from Brown University in Providence, R.I., before joining the U.S.
Army Reserves. After a brief stint working at Brown's sports information
department, he returned to Baltimore to attend law school at the University of
Maryland.

"My father was in the real estate business ... so I went there for a while and
didn't like it and then I had the opportunity to join Manekin," Alter said.

For many of the first years he worked in direct sales. In the early 1980s he
started focusing on development, which would set him and Manekin Corp. apart.
The company moved its headquarters to Columbia at the right time.

"I'm getting too old to be a deal junkie, but I like looking for new business.
So I'm still out there. ... It's who I am." - Richard Alter

"Howard County was a very big focus of our world. We believed that the Rouse
Co.'s vision of Columbia would work. Much of our early product is similar to
what you see here today," Alter said from inside the company's headquarters in
the Columbia Gateway Business Park.

The company would blossom, becoming the second largest real estate holdings
company in Howard County, next to the master planner, Rouse Co. It added
construction and asset management divisions. Alter was named president and chief
executive in 1987.

"Fairly early in my term, in the early 1990s, the world turns upside-down and we
get what really was a real estate depression," he said. "I spent a lot of the
first early years trying to stabilize and rebuild to our future."

Manekin would emerge from the real estate depression in relatively strong shape.
In the mid-1990s it expanded its holdings and entered other markets, such as
Northern Virginia.

By 1999, AMB Property Group, a San Francisco-based real estate investment trust,
had purchased half of Manekin, ending most of the family control.

"We decided there were two or three things we'd like to accomplish to ensure
success for our next 50 years," Alter said. "One was to finally clean up the
financial issues that had hung over from the real estate depression and, two,
was to recapitalize the company."

Company leadership agreed in addition to adding two more goals: transition the
ownership of the company and "come up with a game plan for the future," Alter
said.

"Howard County was a very big focus of our world. We believed that the Rouse
Co.'s vision of Columbia would work." - Richard Alter

"That led to a 30-month effort to find a partner, which led to our partnership
with AMB," Alter said.

It also ended Manekin involvement, with the exception of Donald Manekin. He,
along with Alter and six other investors, owned 50 percent of the company.

AMB started to focus on industrial development and leasing, a company theory
that ran contrary to the way the local ownership, including Alter, wanted to
proceed.

"They changed focuses on what they were doing. Their product types and our
product types were different and it made it difficult," Alter said.

He and the seven other investors bought out AMB at the end of last year.

With Manekin on stable ground, Alter has a chance to look back at what he has
accomplished.

Moving the company from a local, family-owned business to a regional,
employee-controlled company and growing it 10-fold are among his greatest
achievements, he says.

Alter wins Ohio High Cup for state wins in 2006-07

BYLINE: DAV E L A M B H E R E A N D T H E R E

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-10

LENGTH: 522 words


Alter High School's powerful performance last fall - which included four teams
in the state finals - continues to pay dividends.

The school will be honored at an upcoming event as the 2006-07 winner of the
Ohio High Cup, which goes to the program with the most points in state
championship events sanctioned by the Ohio High School Athletic Association.

The award is presented by JJ Huddle's Ohio High magazine.

Alter, led by Athletic Director Chris Hart, becomes the fourth school to win the
award. Versailles was the inaugural winner in 2003-04, followed by Walsh Jesuit
and Cincinnati St. Xavier.

"I think the fact that we won that award is a tribute to our coaches and
student-athletes," Hart said.

The Alter AD noted that hard work and dedication have enabled the Knights to
accomplish "more with less" in regards to facilities, budgets and coaches'
salaries.

Last year, the Knights captured the Division II state championship. They also
finished runner-up in three fall sports - girls cross country (Division II),
boys soccer (DII) and football (Division III).

Alter also claimed fourth place at the D-II state girls track championships.

The Knights, who finished with 15 points in the overall standings, edged out
runnerup Upper Arlington (13.5). The Golden Bears won state titles in boys golf
and girls swimming.

Firebirds return state qualifier

Kettering Fairmont High School lost a team leader from its girls cross country
team, but the Firebirds have a state qualifier back to lead a solid nucleus.

Megan Kelsey, who was a team captain and a state qualifier as a junior, now runs
cross country and track at Bowling Green.

She is the only graduate from the Firebird team that finished runner-up in the
Greater Western Ohio Conference and district runner-up.

Kelsey's younger sister, Andrea, is back after qualifying for the state meet
last fall. She was also the Dayton area's top 3,200-meter finisher last spring.

Fairmont looks strong with seniors Rudy Millard, Amanda Dahlman and Sara Warvel;
juniors Brittany Mefford and Katy Weigel; and sophomore Claire Robillard back
from last years varsity squad.

Freshman Maria Meredith adds some depth for Steve Hippenmeyer's team.

Fairmont wrestlers reach nationals

Three Fairmont wrestlers reached one of the biggest spectacles in the sport this
summer.

Tommy Potter (135 pounds), Lloyd Shannon (171) and Aaron Ford (112), all
returning starters for the high school program, qualified for the Cadet/Junior
Nationals in Fargo, S.D.

"The tournament is actually the largest wrestling tournament in the world - 25
mats in the Fargodome," Fairmont coach Frank Baxter said. "It's quite a sight."

The trio didn't place at nationals, but Baxter knows they will benefit from the
experience.

"You train with the best in Ohio for a week before even going to Fargo," Baxter
said.

"Add to that, though, the fact that in order to be ready for camp you need to
train through the spring and summer and you can see how beneficial it can be.
The experience, training and exposure to high-level wrestling is invaluable. "

Alter girls return for tough year

BYLINE: Dave Lamb HERE AND THERE

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-11

LENGTH: 545 words


Don't throw away last year's program for the Alter girls high school soccer
team. It's the same cast of characters with 18 players returning, including all
11 starters, for one of the area's most intriguing teams.

Head coach Jason Balogh, who started as many as nine sophomores last year,
thinks their trial by fire will pay off.

"I'm hoping that the return of all that experience helps out," he said. "We were
extremely young last year, but we also did rather well."

Alter posted an 11-9 record last year, including three straight shutout wins in
tournament play before a 2-1 loss to eventual Division II state champion
Hamilton Badin.

The Knights will need every bit of that experience to withstand their rugged
schedule

They open the season Aug. 26 and 27 against Bay Village, a state semifinalist in
Division II, and Strongsville, the state's defending Division I champion.

Balogh knows it won't get any easier in the Girls Greater Cincinnati League.

"The big dog on the block is still Badin, who returns nearly every player as we
do," he said. "The GGCL got even tougher if that's possible with the addition of
Chaminade-Julienne, Fenwick and Carroll."

With Oakwood, Fenwick and Valley View all expected to be improved, that "will
make our district extremely difficult to get out of. We're working hard to be
the best we can be come tournament time," Balogh said.

Alter soccer standout signs with Alabama

Alter senior Carly Mygrants, a first-team All-Ohio player last year, already
knows where she'll continue her career in college.

The second-year captain will play at the University of Alabama.

The Crimson Tide finished 8-8-2 last year in the Southeastern Conference.

Mygrants has been an All-GGCL performer since her freshman season and was the
league's runner-up player of the year last year. The center midfielder was named
the Dayton South Player of the Year.

She has also enjoyed success at the club level with two trips to the regional
level with Cincinnati United Premier.

Fairmont goalie plays in Germany

On the heels of the World Cup soccer tournament in Germany, Fairmont senior
goalkeeper Corey Whisenhunt has been playing with a U.S. select national team at
many of the same venues.

Whisenhunt earned a spot on the 1988 (under-18) team with his performance at a
tryout camp in Florida in January. Eighteen players were selected from a pool of
126.

The U.S. team was scheduled to play in 10 matches in 15 days against teams from
Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic

Whisenhunt won't be home for long. He will play for a Louisvillebased team in a
national tournament in Boston Aug. 3-6.

His Louisville team plays in the United States Soccer League that includes teams
from Toronto, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee and Western Michigan.

Firebirds ready for action

Are the Fairmont Firebirds ready to start the boys high school soccer season?

On the home page of their Web site at fairmontsoccer.com, the Firebirds have a
countdown clock - down to the seconds - to their season opener at 7:30 p.m. Aug.
22 against Piqua.

Fairmont's Web site has an interview with former Firebird and University of
Dayton standout Chris Rolfe, who plays Major League Soccer for the Chicago Fire.
The site also includes several action photos.

which covers 11 states.

The Arsenal qualified by finishing runner-up in the Midwest Region League's
Premier Division with a 7-2-1 record. Over the past two years, her team has

Bowman returns to Centerville track

Bob Bowman is back coaching at Centerville High School, this time with the girls
track team.

The veteran coach guided the successful boys cross country team from 1986 to
2004.

He stepped down from the fall sport so he could watch his daughter, Morgan, play
soccer. She's now a sophomore at Centerville.

Bowman missed coaching, and the opening with the spring sport fit the bill. He
served as a track assistant from 1986 to 1997, except for one year with the
middle school.

He was looking to get involved again as an assistant, but athletic director Ron
Ullery approached him about the head position when Craig Sherman retired.

"I'm optimistic about the team," Bowman said. "We have a good nucleus of talent
coming back.

Bowman teaches advanced placement classes in U.S. history and serves as a
student government adviser.

Expert: Teaching intelligent design impedes learning

BYLINE: By Amy Worden; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: PHILADELPHIA; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 555 words

DATELINE: HARRISBURG


A leading science education expert, testifying in a federal trial over the
teaching of evolution in a York County school district, said yesterday that
introducing intelligent design into the science classroom is "detrimental" to
learning.

Brian Alters, a professor of science education at McGill University in Montreal,
denounced a policy requiring a disclaimer on evolution be read in Dover Area
School District high school biology classes, saying it "engenders
misconceptions" about science. "It is the the worst thing I've heard of in
science education," Alters said.

Eleven parents in the school district sued the Dover, Pa., school board over a
policy that went into effect earlier this year. It requires that science
teachers read a four-paragraph statement that says that Darwin's theory of
evolution is "only a theory" and that "gaps" in the theory exist. It also
introduces intelligent design as an alternative to Darwin's theory and directs
students to an intelligent design textbook for more information.

School administrators have read the statement since its approval because Dover
biology teachers are opposed its contents and have refused to read it.

Alters was the first of three witnesses who took the stand yesterday as
testimony resumed in the third week of the closely watched trial - the first on
the teaching of intelligent design.

Alters said the vast majority of the scientific community - and all the leading
scientific organizations - are opposed to the teaching of intelligent design, a
relatively new concept that promotes the idea that life is so complex that there
must be a designer behind it.

He said that the bulk of the statement read to Dover students is "dead wrong"
and is counter to Darwin's theory of evolution, the "cornerstone of modern
biology."

"Darwin's theory is a theory and a fact in that scientists' confidence in the
theory is so high they no longer debate it," Alters said. "It is considered
factual in the scientific community."

Alters denied defense arguments that the reading of a statement was not
teaching.

During cross examination, defense attorney Robert Muise challenged Alters'
statements that teaching intelligent design is detrimental to students.

"Do you have studies to show that intelligent design is detrimental?" Muise
asked.

"I have no studies that show that any pseudo science is detrimental," Alters
replied.

The trial has received international attention as a modern-day version of the
1925 Scopes monkey trial.

Also yesterday two plaintiffs, who have children in the Dover school district,
testified that they felt they were harmed by the Dover school policy.

Steven Stough, whose 14-year-old daughter is taking biology at Dover High School
this fall, said he called the American Civil Liberties, one of two civil
liberties groups representing the plaintiffs, after the board approved the
policy last October.

"I felt my rights and the rights of my daughter were violated," Steven Stough
said.

Cynthia Snead said she thought intelligent design was a synonym for Bible-based
creationism and had no place in public school science classrooms.

"It's my privilege to guide [my children] on matters of faith, not teachers,
administrators or the school board."

Alter Out to Prove Jolie's Halo Is No Lightweight

Vinnie Perrone, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; PAGE C7

LENGTH: 652 words

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, May 7


Robin Platts traveled here from Toronto today just for practice.

With Saturday's $ 750,000 Pimlico Special approaching, Platts came to exercise
Jolie's Halo and to preserve his place atop him, a far-off consideration a year
ago when the colt showed no inclination of becoming a good racehorse.

After Platts missed an opportunity to ride stakes-winner Frosty The Snowman,
trainer Happy Alter told Platts he'd make up for it with a quality mount.
Jolie's Halo, an Arthur Appleton homebred, was deemed the one.

The first time Platts attempted to work him, Jolie's Halo never got out of a
canter. The next time, Alter put blinkers on him and placed him alongside a $
12,000 claiming filly. They ran a half-mile. The filly won.

"That's when the crew said, 'You're too high on this horse,' " Alter said. "I
said, 'You think so? Well you're going to be reading about this horse.' He
looked like a teenage boy who just had his first date. He had that look you see
sometimes -- I think you see the look in a fighter sometimes before the world
hears about him -- and you see it in a good horse sometimes."

Alter grew up in the ring, more precisely the 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach,
where he says he became friendly with Muhammad Ali.  What's left of his boxing
aspirations is a stable emblem, posted outside Jolie's Halo's stall, that
consists of two boxing gloves on a yellow background.

Jolie's Halo has become his top contender after all, overcoming shin problems
that delayed his debut until last October, when he was 3.

Despite the late start Jolie's Halo won his first six decisions, two in Canada,
the rest in Florida. His only defeat came lately, a third-place finish in the
Oaklawn Handicap on sloppy footing.

Of the seven horses pre-entered in Saturday's Pimlico Special -- fourth of 10
races that make up the American Championship Racing Series -- five come out of
the Oaklawn race: Festin, who won it, Jolie's Halo, Silver Survivor (fourth
place), Unbridled (fifth) and Farma Way (seventh). The Special looks special
because they are the best older horses in training, and Summer Squall now joins
them. Reputed Testamony, a local, is also pre-entered.

Jolie's Halo worked six furlongs in 1:11 1/5 this morning for Platts, who then
went back to Toronto.

"I have the same strong comparisons between training racehorses and fighters
getting ready for a fight," he said. "The fighter should never leave his fight
in the gym, and you never want to overdo it with a horse training for a race." A
Helping Hand

Jockey Danny Wright helped rescue a woman who had fallen into the Inner Harbor
Monday night.

Wright, 44, was representing Pimlico at a United Way fund-raiser aboard a boat
docked in the harbor when the woman, who was not identified, fell from a pier.
Wright, dressed in riding silks, and a crewman dove from the boat and brought
her to safety.

"She was going down," Wright said. "She must have hit her head on the way down
because she wasn't too coherent; she couldn't swim. I felt blessed to be able to
help the lady." . . .

Reality returned with a jolt for Andrea Seefeldt. A day after she became the
third woman to ride in the Kentucky Derby, Seefeldt hurried to Philadelphia Park
to take the free-spirited Diamond Donnie through the Delaware Handicap on
Sunday. Soon out of the gate, Diamond Donnie made a right-hand turn -- something
he does from time to time -- and left Seefeldt in the dirt.

"Diamond Donnie brought me back to earth," she said.

Maryland-based Wind Splitter won the race, tying the six-furlong track record of
1:08 1/5.

Seefeldt called the Derby experience "so fulfilling" even though her mount, the
long shot Forty Something, finished last. He was a force for seven furlongs,
pressuring pacemaker Sea Cadet before slowing abruptly on the far turn.

"I just had to stay out of everybody's way," she said. "He backed up so fast, it
could have been dangerous."

Ottawa-Glandorf to meet balanced Alter for girls Division II state basketball
title

BYLINE: Tom Usher, The Lima News, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 652 words


March 12--COLUMBUS -- Balance.

That's the key to No. 1-ranked Kettering Alter.

The Division II defending state champion Knights feature two Division I college
players and a third who has her pick of many of the top schools in the country.

Alter (27-2) will meet No. 5-ranked Ottawa-Glandorf (26-2) in the Division II
girls basketball state championship game at 2 p.m., today, at Ohio State's Value
City Arena.

This is Alter's seventh state trip and it owns state titles in 2008 and last
year. This marks the Titans' second trip to state, as they finished as the state
runner-up to Versailles in Division III last year.

This year's Alter team has plenty of quickness and athleticism.

"They were state champs last year and have some nice talent back," O-G coach
Troy Yant said. "But I don't think our girls will shy away. I think we'll come
out and play and do the best we can."

Alter's leading scorer is the athletic 5-11 junior Braxtin Miller, who is
averaging 12.2 points and 3.4 rebounds. She was honorable mention all-state.
According to her coach, Chris Hart, she is being recruited by most of the top 25
colleges in the county.

In Alter's 60-34 state semifinal win over Columbus Eastmoor, Miller led her team
with 19 points and nine rebounds. She was 4 of 10 on 3-pointers.

Miller is also the team's top defensive player and held Eastmoor's first team
all-state guard Amani Burke (Ohio U.) to five points, with three of those coming
on a meaningless 3-pointer in the final seconds.

"I really wanted to play good defense on her," Miller said. "I take great pride
in my defense. I want to be the go-to player on defense."

Alter's Libby Bazelak, a 5-9 junior guard, is going to Duquesne and is first
team all-state. She averages 10 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. In the state
semifinal, she had 12 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.

"Miller and Bazelak both make our team go," Hart said. "And they make our other
players better."

Hayley Combs is Alter's person on the blocks. The 6-foot senior is averaging 8.4
points and 4 rebounds and is headed to Northern Kentucky University. She had
five points and four rebounds in the state semifinal.

Olivia Gillis, a 5-10 junior, averages only 4 points, but scored 16, on 8 of 8
shooting in the state semifinal.

The fifth starter for Alter is 5-4 senior Kara Stephenson, who averages 3
points.

Alter played man-to-man the entire way in the state semifinal and will probably
play lots of man against O-G.

The Knights will probably match the 5-11 Miller on O-G's top scorer Kadie
Hempfling.

Hempfling, the second-team all-state sophomore, is averaging 15.3 points and 8.2
rebounds. She had 20 points and six rebounds in the 51-40 state semifinal
victory over Hathaway Brown.

The Titans outscored Hathaway Brown 14-0 in the final quarter, with the 5-9
Hempfling holding 6-2, Purdue-bound Dani Lawson scoreless in the final quarter
and to 13 points overall.

Kylie White, a 5-9 forward, averages 12.7 points and 8.3 rebounds for O-G. She
had 11 points and 11 rebounds in the state semifinals.

Point guard Dani Ellerbrock averages 8.4 points and 3.7 assists. The four-year
starter has played in 107 high school games for her career. She'll play next
year at Mount Vernon Nazarene.

"This is amazing," Ellerbrock said. "As a freshman I really didn't that we would
do this. I didn't imagine it, but we've worked so hard for four years. We have
chemistry and it's awesome we get to play in the state final two years in a
row."

Forward Lexi Schroeder is averaging 7.8 points, while freshman Erin Kaufman is
averaging 4.8 points.

The Titans' defense has been a major factor in their tournament success. They
forced 19 Hathaway Brown turnovers in the semifinals.

Cityfolk hires new executive director;
Kathleen Alter, an Indiana native, has experience running large festivals.

BYLINE: By Dave Larsen Staff Writer

LENGTH: 283 words


DAYTON - Cityfolk has hired a new executive director with experience running
large-scale free music festivals, much like the annual Cityfolk Festival.

On Wednesday, Kathleen Alter was named the executive director of Dayton's
traditional arts organization.

Alter, an Indiana native who previously served as director of the French Quarter
Festival in New Orleans, will assume her new role Monday, Oct. 4. She also
directed the Three Rivers Festival in Fort Wayne, Ind.

Jerry Brunswick, president of Cityfolk's board, said Alter's strong skills in
fundraising, management and event planning will help Cityfolk "become an even
more integral and sustainable part of the Dayton region, and its vibrant arts
and entertainment scene."

Alter succeeds John Harris, who is credited with stabilizing and steering the
nonprofit folk arts presenting group through hard times over seven years. Harris
announced his departure in January, but remained as executive director through
the 2010 Cityfolk Festival in July.

"I love that Cityfolk strives to make music accessible to all members of the
community," Alter said in a statement.

The Cityfolk Festival, a free, three-day event that started in 1999 following a
three-year Dayton residency of the National Folk Festival, announced that this
year could be its last because of $140,000 in lost corporate sponsorships.
Cityfolk launched a Friends of the Festival fundraising campaign to help make up
the 2010 shortfall.

The campaign reached its $40,000 goal, said Dave Barber, Cityfolk's director of
programs and marketing.

"The Friends of the Festival campaign worked out very well for us," Barber said.

LENGTH: 250 words


FAIRBORN - Alter and Dunbar, come on down.

The Knights and Wolverines both passed their boys high school regional
basketball semifinals Thursday night at Wright State University. They'll return
to the Nutter Center at 3 p.m. Saturday, the winner advancing to the Division II
state tourney.

Wolves, round II: Aaron Pogue had 25 points, 17 rebounds and plenty of payback
as Dunbar tripped previously unbeaten Tippecanoe 60-53. Tipp handled Dunbar in
the regular season, 61-49.

Onward Alter: The Knights lost, then found their shooting touch to close out
Columbus Beechcroft 70-62 in the D-II semi opener. Alter (21-2) missed its first
seven free throws in the final quarter. "I'm elated to be playing Saturday,"
Alter coach Joe Petrocelli said. "It's great for the area."

Poof: That's how Trotwood-Madison's dream of returning to the state D-I tourney
ended following a 75-64 regional semi loss to St. Xavier at Cincinnati.

The Rams' (23-2) only other loss was to Oak Hill (Va.) Academy, the nation's
top-ranked team.

Girls state tourney: Versailles hung tough until the final 1:34, falling 51-39
to Cleveland Central Catholic in the D-III semis at OSU's Schottenstein Center.
Ms. Basketball Jantel Lavender had 14 points and 14 rebounds to carry CCC
(25-1).

Versailles (23-4) closed within four with less than two minutes left before
Central Catholic sealed the deal.

* New Knoxville (21-4) meets Bedford St. Peter Chanel in a D-IV state semi today
at OSU.

LENGTH: 369 words


Alter High School's aggressive defense proved too much for yet another opponent
Friday, Feb. 15, in a Division II girls high school basketball sectional final
at Springboro.

The Knights (20-3) pressed Oxford Talawanda into submission, 63-17, to earn
their eighth straight trip to the Dayton D-II district.

They will play Cincinnati Taft in a district final Friday, Feb. 22, at Mason.

Alter has averaged 74.7 points in three tournament games and allowed an average
of 19 in defeats of Franklin (75-26), Stivers (86-15) and Talawanda.

"Our guards have gotten out and pressured the ball pretty well the entire game,"
Alter coach Chris Hart said. "I know we had forced them (Talawanda) into 21
turnovers in the first half, and that was pretty much the game."

Alter led 33-6 at halftime, shutting out Talawanda in the first quarter, 12-0.

Ashley Christie led 12 Alter players in scoring with 14 points.

Tippecanoe 52, Benjamin Logan 37: The Red Devils hit 13-of-16 free throws in the
fourth quarter to win a D-II sectional title at Vandalia. The Red Devils (20-3)
get Bellbrook (19-4) in a district final at Mason. Abby Dowd had 16 points,
including 9-of-10 free throws in the fourth quarter. Cassie Berning and Leah
Schiller followed with 13 points each.

Boys tournament

Springboro 55, Troy 46:

The Panthers (14-8) won for the ninth time in their last 10 games in the D-I
sectional at UD Arena. They now get Wayne in the sectional final Saturday, Feb.
23. Austin McMahan was their leading scorer with 12 points, followed by Cody
Bohnic with 11.

Houston 74, Fairlawn 58:

Dan Estes scored 26 points, and Dustin Schwable added 19 as the Wildcats (17-4)
won a D-IV sectional game at Piqua.

Fort Loramie 49, Jackson Center 31: Kyle Gasson scored 14 points, and Mitch
Westerheide had 10 as Loramie (13-7) won another D-IV game at Piqua.

No. 1 D-IV team, their second consecutive 20-0 regular season and another
Midwest Athletic Conference title.

Marion Local 53, St. Henry 47: The win gives the Flyers (15-5) a second-place

Cattran wins title in 400; Alter girls finish 2nd overall;
Versailles pole vaulter breaks state record; Cedarville junior places in both
the discus and the shot put.

COLUMBUS - Alter had Akron Buchtel right where the Knights wanted them through
14 events.

But Buchtel went on a meet-ending 16-3 run to win the Division II girls team
title Saturday in the state trackand-field meet at Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium.

Alter, powered by its outstanding all-round depth, tied for fourth.

She's No. 1

Alter's Ashley Cattran was in panic mode. Buchtel freshman Kachay Hullum was
threatening to run away with the 400, blowing by the field with less than the
homestretch remaining.

"I was just trying to tell myself not to panic, even though I really wanted to,"
Cattran said.

Instead, the senior rallied hard over the last 50 meters to win (56.18 seconds)
while Hullum wilted to third.

Cattran also ran anchor in Friday's winning 3,200 relay. That provided the bulk
of Alter's 31 points, good for a tie with Beloit West Branch. Only three points
separated teams 2-4.

Best of field

Versailles' Amanda Barlage saved the best for last. The senior was second in the
D-III pole vault the last two years and was amped to improve one place.

And she delivered, setting an all-time, all-division best effort of 12 feet, 4
inches. "I really wanted that," she said. "I've been waiting all season for this
meet. I wanted that 12-4 really bad."

Close, but no ...

Cedarville's Katie Bunker was buried in mid-pack with two straights left in the
D-III 800. "I was really tired," the freshman said. "I thought, there's no
point."

But with a half-lap left, Bunker dug deep and flew to fourth (2:17.19).

Junior teammate Katie Gerhardt was a double threat, placing third in the shot
put (41-3?) and fourth in the discus (145-7). She also earned a bigtime embrace
from D-I shot put champ Jimmie Pacifico afterward.

"We're just friends," Gerhardt said. "He's a big supporter."

Quotable

"I've never had my legs go dead before. Now I know what it feels like. It's the
most upsetting feeling when you can't feel your legs and you're supposed to be
running."

- Oakwood senior Dani Reese after locking up and dropping to third over the last
10 meters of the D-II 800 (2:14.38).

Hot laps

* Euclid's Jessica Beard is a rare four-time winner of the same running event.
The senior swept the D-I 400 from 2004-07, finishing with an alltime,
all-division record (51.63).

* Cleveland Beaumont's Emily Infeld posted two all-time records. The junior won
her third D-I 800 title (2:08.63) and also shattered the 1,600 mark (4:41.37).

* Emily Pendleton of Elmore Woodmore is the first person to win four titles in a
single field event in the 100-year history of this meet (33rd for the girls).
She swept the DIII discus, posting an all-time record (163-4).

Labor Day weekend promises to be busy;
Your choices range from Renaissance to R&B, from a county fair to Kettering
Holiday at Home

BYLINE: By Laura Houser Staff Writer

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. D6

LENGTH: 408 words


Looking to stay in town this Labor Day weekend? Don't fear: Besides the
obligatory backyard barbecue, there's plenty to do all over town for anyone
still on "staycation."

Check out the Blues Fest at 6 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 5, at Centerville's Stubbs
Park Amphitheater. Concert-goers can enjoy three local blues bands and then cast
their vote for the best performance. The winning band will be invited to return
to Stubbs Park next summer to perform at their own two-hour concert.

The concert will feature the Doug Hart Band, a southwestern Ohio staple for more
than a decade; Michael Locke & The Repeat Offenders, a soulful blues group; and
Jimmy Baker & Blues Encounter, a high-energy funk and blues band.

Or, head over to Alter Fest at Alter High School in Kettering. Enjoy
performances by The Johnsons, Bonneville and Velvet Crush, among others, and
stay for their "world famous" chicken dinners.

For those looking for a carnival atmosphere, check out the Montgomery County
Fair, which lasts through Monday.

Events include the annual 4-H Club shows, carnival rides and games, a demolition
derby, truck and tractor pulls, a Jungle Island Petting Zoo, Ohio Xtreme
Fighting and harness racing.

Kettering will host the 51st annual Holiday at Home, a community festival
celebrating the holiday weekend. This year's theme is Backyard Fun, with the
weekend spotlighted by an arts and crafts show in the Lincoln Park Pavilion, a
car show, a 5K run/walk, the Miss Holiday Pageant and the Holiday at Home Parade
on Monday.

For even more music, visit RiverScape MetroPark on Saturday for a performance of
Touch, a Dayton-area R&B band, as they perform songs from The Temptations and
The Commodores from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.

Or, if it's a little ye old fun you're looking for, check out the 20th annual
Ohio Renaissance Festival, which kicks off Saturday. It continues on Saturdays
and Sundays through Oct. 25. See some jousting, eat a giant turkey leg and don't
be surprised if you're heckled by shopkeepers insistent that you peruse their
wares. Tights and chain mail are not the required dress, but encouraged.

And since Labor Day signals the end of summer, end it with a bang at the WEBN
Fireworks in downtown Cincinnati on Sunday, drawing crowds from all over Ohio,
Kentucky and Indiana. Make sure to get there early - it's a bit of a drive and
people stake out prime viewing spots early in the day.

Scrap yard, lumber yard will have to move for Haymarket arena;

BYLINE: DEENA WINTER

SECTION: FRONT PAGE; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 304 words


While railroads own most of the land on which the city plans its arena
development, a lumber yard and scrap yard will have to move to make way for
parking.

Alter Metal Recycling is slated to become a parking lot and power plant. The
scrap yard owner has been in contact with the city for months, said Bob Ellis,
vice president and general counsel of St. Louis-based Alter Trading Corp.

Alter will move if it gets fair compensation for the property and can find a
suitable new place with railroad and truck access, he said.

"We're continuing to search. We haven't found a place yet."

Moving a scrap yard may seem like a monumental task, but with 35 locations in
seven states, Alter has done it before. He said it would take 12 to 18 months,
depending on the condition of the new site.

"It doesn't happen real quickly, but it can happen," he said. "It's not like
moving a hardware store or moving a grocery store."

Watson-Brickson Lumber Co. is slated to become a parking lot as well. Owner Brad
Devall declined comment.

The city also intends to buy parking near Lincoln Station, which is owned by The
Arter Group. President Jim Arter said he's talked with developers who will be
building straight west of Lincoln Station and they expressed interest in Lincoln
Station.

"We were open to an offer," he said. "We've not had any offers, and we're not
trying to solicit any."

He's waiting to hear how the development will affect his tenants' parking. The
city has a long-term lease on the parking north of Lincoln Station. Arter said
he supports the arena project but he's not so sure the new development will
increase Lincoln Station's property values or change his tenant mix.

One tenant that will be leaving is the Amtrak station. The city will build a new
station farther west.

Ft. Lee Warns It May Close Bridge Roads

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY,   Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B;  Page 6;  Column 1;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 738 words

DATELINE: FORT LEE, N.J., Oct. 13


Fort Lee's mayor declared war on the Port Authority today, threatening to take
morning commuters hostage by throwing up rush-hour roadblocks on local streets
leading to the George Washington Bridge.

Life with the bridge, Mayor Jack Alter proclaimed, is a litany of unreimbursed
costs and misery -- streets clogged in the morning with bumper-to-bumper
traffic, motorists darting around side streets looking for quick entry to toll
booths, risky crossings for school children, inordinate expense for the police,
the courts and road upkeep, and not a cent in return from the authority, the
bridge's tax-exempt owner.

"They get all the revenues, and we get all the expenses," Mayor Alter said.
"It's not fair for local property taxpayers to pay for a major moneymaker. They
tell us to go whistle.  They say they don't pay anybody."

By injecting the commuter into Fort Lee's long feud with the Port Authority,
Mayor Alter seems certain to jangle commuters' frayed nerves and send ripples of
anger, not to mention traffic, into neighboring Leonia, Edgewater and Englewood
Cliffs. But he is also likely to impress Fort Lee voters at re-election time and
win allies for the city's campaign to persuade New Jersey and New York State to
overturn the bridge's tax exemption.

Legislation pending in Trenton would require the Port Authority to pay Fort Lee
$10 million in taxes for bridge property in the town, Mayor Alter said. He
suggested that $5 million would satisfy the town. That would be about 20 percent
of local property tax revenue, and the amount that Fort Lee spends annually to
run its 93-member Police Department and two municipal courts, and to maintain
Center and Lemoine avenues and other roads pounded by thousands of cars and
trucks heading for the bridge, Mayor Alter said.

The police could decide to close streets on a case-by-case basis each day, the
Mayor said, based on whether traffic on a street hampered the city's emergency
services. "We don't want our emergency vehicles frozen in place," Mayor Alter
said.

The bridge's manager, Allegra Lockett, criticized Fort Lee's plan as a "serious
disservice to commuters" and said she would be surprised if roadblocks ever went
up. "I know Mayor Alter to be a sensitive and compassionate man," Mrs. Lockett
said.

But she had little positive to say about Fort Lee's campaign to tax the bridge,
which, she said, earned about $144 million last year on gross toll revenues of
about $230 million.

The Port Authority's airports, docks, terminals and Hudson River crossings have
always been tax exempt. "They all operate for the good of the general public and
shouldn't be taxed," she said.

But the Mayor contended that the presence of the bridge and all the roads
feeding it require Fort Lee to keep a police force about twice as large as those
in towns with a similar population -- about 32,000. And Fort Lee, he said, must
have an extra court to process arrests on bridge property by Port Authority
police.

While Fort Lee has been feuding with the Port Authority for years, it has
escalated its threats now, the Mayor suggested, because Port Authority police
officers have reduced arrests on the bridge since 1992 -- a charge that the Port
Authority denies. The Mayor said that means less revenue for town courts. Mr.
Alter also said that the Port Authority dispatches officers to direct traffic at
only three busy intersections each day, forcing the city to patrol four others
that the Port Authority used to police.

Mrs. Lockett said bridge officials plan to have Port Authority officers at the
seven busy intersection every morning, but sometimes illness or family
emergencies prevent it.

Some residents were gleeful over the Mayor's threat.

"They've been ignoring us for years," said Jane Lasher, a resident of 20 years.
"Blocking roads sounds like a desperation move. Fair or not, it may help this
little town. We've been fighting them for years, and we can't get a penny out of
them."

Bruce Holtje, the owner of Fort Lee Hardware on Main Street and a volunteer
firemen, said he and other firefighters tried to take a fire engine to a local
school the other day for a Fire Prevention Week demonstration.

"It took us 15 minutes to get out of the fire house because of bumper-to-bumper
traffic," Mr. Holtje said. "The cars can't move and you have to holler and
scream at people to back up and they just say, 'Those bums in the firehouse.' "

FINE VS. ELECTION ATT'Y KOD BY APPEALS COURT

BYLINE: By BOB LIFF DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SUBURBAN; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 309 words

A Brooklyn judge threw the book at election lawyer Mitch Alter last September,
leveling $2,000 in fines against Alter and his clients for bringing what the
judge called a frivolous lawsuit.

This week, it was an appellate panel's chance to throw the book, and it landed
back on Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Melvin Barasch - the appellate panel
reversed the judge's ruling.

The flap started as Alter was representing Assemblyman Darryl Towns, who was
challenged by term-limited City Councilman Martin Malave-Dilan in a Cypress
Hills-based assembly district primary.

Malave-Dilan was late in filing required campaign finance reports in Albany, so
Alter and Towns rounded up five constituents to file suit asking Barasch to stop
Malave-Dilan from spending any money until the reports were filed.

The result would have been to force Malave-Dilan to shut down his campaign the
weekend before the primary.

In a handwritten order, Barasch accused Alter of trying to "use the court as its
political arm to subvert the voting process." He declared the lawsuit frivolous,
and fined Alter $500, and each of the Towns' supporters $300 each.

Alter appealed, and a four-judge appellate panel on Monday reversed Barasch's
order.

"The application was not without legal merit, was not brought in bad faith and
did not assert false material [as] factual statements," read the appellate order
written by Judge Fred Santucci.

The appellate order also lifted the fines Barasch imposed on Alter and Towns'
supporters.

"Judge Barasch's order had the effect of trying to chill litigants' rights in
serious election matters," Alter, a veteran of Brooklyn's legal political wars,
said yesterday. "Darryl Towns had the right to sue."

Towns defeated Malave-Dilan handily in the primary, and went on to win
reelection to the Assembly last November.

Alter Says He Will Run for Fifth Term as Treasurer of Utah

                             March 18, 1996, Monday

By Antonio A. Prado

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES



Utah Treasurer Edward Alter, often called the "dean of state treasurers," said
on Friday that he will seek his fifth term as the state's top fiscal officer.

If he wins in November, the Republican - first elected in 1980 - will continue
to be among the nation's longest-serving state treasurers, and the longest in
office now to serve in the Far West.

No opposition to his candidacy had surfaced by late Friday, but Alter said he
expects a Democratic challenger to file by today's deadline.

Observers said he is likely to win in November because of his tight fiscal
management and because Utah is heavily Republican.

Alter is among a class of state treasurers first inaugurated in January 1981,
among them North Carolina's Harlan Boyles, Arkansas' Jimmie Lou Fisher, and
Maine's Sam Shapiro.

"Sam and I always joke about who served the longest," Alter said in a telephone
interview Friday, commenting that Shapiro was first elected in December 1980, a
month after him.

"He was inaugurated a couple of days earlier," Alter said. "So he thinks he's
longer serving than I."

Under Alter, Utah has kept its triple-A credit ratings while many states have
seen their creditworthiness tumble.

"He's probably the dean of all state treasurers by now," said D. Kent Michie, a
vice president with Zions Bank Public Finance in Salt Lake City, who worked with
Alter in putting together the Utah School Bond Default Avoidance Program,
approved last month by state lawmakers.

The program, which requires voter approval in November, puts Utah's full faith
and credit behind the state's local school bond issues in an effort to secure
triple-A ratings and associated interest savings.

"To my knowledge we are the first state that will consider, and actually put its
full faith and credit behind these bonds," said Michie, who praised Alter's
efforts to pitch the program to lawmakers.

Alter said he plans to continue his agenda of maintaining conservative state
finances, and his effort to keep Utah as a top-rated credit.

Financial World magazine has ranked Utah number one among U.S. states in
government management competence, crediting that largely on the state's tight
fiscal controls and Alter's treasury administration.

The magazine - which has repeatedly ranked the state near the top - cited Utah's
triple-A general obligation bond rating with the top-three credit rating
agencies, its high rainy-day reserve, and accounting practices in giving it a
high ranking.

Among Alter's more specific plans, is a plan to craft a bond guarantee program
for Utah's higher education issues similar to the local school debt guarantee
proposal.

Alter has suggested some form of lending program, with a moral obligation pledge
from the state to back higher education bonds, predicting that these issues
could garner double-A ratings with a state guarantee.

"The (University of Utah) Board of Regents guards jealously their own
authority," Alter said. "If the state could issue their bonds, they could do
better.

As "direct children of the state," like local school districts, Alter said Utah
ought to provide some form of preventive backing measures instead of waiting
until after the fact to clean up the effects of a bond default.

"There are always plenty of things to work on," Alter said.

Over the last year Alter has spoken out in favor of more oversight of state and
local government investments, offering harsh public criticism of the Dec. 6,
1994 Orange County bankruptcy and the financial melt down that led to a $1.64
billion loss in its investment pool.

Alter, in a speech last year on local government investment pools, also chided
some state and county treasurers, such as former Orange County Treasurer Robert
L. Citron, for abusing their status as major investors operating in a largely
unregulated industry.

"We have an obligation to do it right, not just drift along and do dumb things
until something happens that makes us all look bad," Alter told an audience at
the annual conference of the Western State Treasurers Association in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., in June 1995.

Alter, who has spoken often about the subject since the nation's largest
municipal bankruptcy, criticized Orange County's Board of Supervisors for lax
oversight.

He has often pointed out that board members there knew little of public
finance's complexities, and called for more government investment oversight by
knowledgeable professionals.

WNBA going to the Windy City

BYLINE: Sports Network

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S5

LENGTH: 379  words

DATELINE: CHICAGO


CHICAGO - The WNBA announced yesterday that they will be adding a new franchise
in Chicago that will begin play in May 2006.

NBA Commissioner David Stern made the announcement today in the Windy City. The
new team will be primarily owned and operated by Chicago businessman Michael
Alter, with a select group of local investors serving as minority owners.

"We are pleased to bring the WNBA to the city of Chicago, home of some of the
most passionate basketball fans in the world," said Stern. "As the WNBA enters
its ninth year, the prospects for its future have never been brighter, which is
why it is attracting independent entrepreneurs like Michael Alter to invest in
the league's expansion."

The Chicago team, which will be named at a later date, is the second WNBA team
to be owned and run by an entity outside of the NBA. In 2003, the Connecticut
Sun became the first independently owned and operated WNBA team.

A Chicago native, Alter is President of The Alter Group, one of the nation's ten
largest commercial real estate developers. He has transformed his family's
company from a strong, regional office and industrial developer into one of the
nation's preeminent privately held full-service real estate companies.

"It's been incredibly exciting for me to invest my time and resources into the
launch of Chicago's WNBA team because I am strongly committed to bringing to
Chicago what I believe will be far more than just a great sports franchise,"
said Alter. "Chicago's WNBA team will bring an exciting, new family
entertainment alternative to this great city and its players can be a powerful
and compelling source of inspiration for Chicago's young people -- girls and
boys alike -- for many decades to come."

The WNBA will feature 14 teams in 2006, with the Eastern and Western Conferences
comprised of seven teams each. Chicago will join the Charlotte Sting,
Connecticut Sun, Detroit Shock, Indiana Fever, New York Liberty and Washington
Mystics in the Eastern Conference; the Houston Comets, Los Angeles Sparks,
Minnesota Lynx, Phoenix Mercury, San Antonio Silver Stars, Seattle Storm and
Sacramento Monarchs will remain in the Western Conference.

The newest WNBA team will play its home games at the UIC Pavilion, located on
the campus of the University of Illinois.

Alter's Courtney to join 3-time national champs

BYLINE: MARC PENDLETON

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 421 words


Talk about upping your game. Megan Courtney of Alter is taking a giant leap.

The 6-1 junior has verbally committed to play volleyball at Penn State
University. The Nittany Lions are the three-time defending national champions.

Courtney also is an outstanding basketball player and was a starter for the
Knights as a freshman when Alter advanced to the Division II state semifinals.
She injured her right knee ACL last basketball season in a late January game vs.
Fairmont and missed the remainder of that season.

Alter and Fairmont advanced to state in 2010; The Knights placed second in D-II
and the Firebirds dropped their D-I semifinal. Courtney averaged 6 points and
6.1 rebounds in 15 games.

Courtney has since recovered from the knee injury.

Quick-strike success

Springfield is the definition of a quick-strike football team.

The high-scoring Wildcats (6-1) have scored 30 touchdowns. More revealing is
that five of their scores have been on the first play of a drive and seven TDs
have been on the second play.

There's more: Not counting an interception and kickoff return for scores,
Springfield's average scoring drive is just four plays.

Coach Rick Robertson reports that the good news is the Wildcats score quickly.
The not so good news is they might have trouble sustaining drives.

Springfield is at Beavercreek on Friday, then hosts Centerville in Week 9 and is
at Northmont in Week 10.

National competition

Area big-school boys and girls soccer teams will have tall tasks in trying to
win state championships beginning with the sectional tournaments on Monday.

Ohio claims both boys and girls big-school teams ranked in the top 5 nationally
by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. Gahanna Lincoln's boys
team is ranked No. 1 in the country, while Cleveland St. Ignatius is ranked 6th.

In girls, Cincinnati St. Ursula Academy is ranked No. 5.

Extra points

* Three of the five state golf tournaments are Friday and Saturday.

The D-II boys will play at OSU's Scarlet Course in Columbus. The D-III boys will
be at Sunbury's North Star Resort.

The D-II girls are at OSU's Gray Course. The D-I boys and girls districts are at
Weatherwax in Middletown on Wednesday.

* The D-I tennis district is Thursday and Saturday at the ATP Lindner Family
Tennis Center in Mason. D-II is Thursday and Saturday at Centerville. That start
time has been moved up to 8 a.m. to avoid a conflict with the Wayne/Centerville
football game Thursday night.

If it's raining, the D-II district will move indoors to Dayton Center Courts on
Salem Avenue.

Books of The Times;
A Biographer Seeking Himself in Another's Identity

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

Biography
By Celia Gittelson
260 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $19.

In recent years, biographers have become a favorite type of novelistic hero.
Bernard Malamud's "Dubin's Lives," Mary Gordon's "Men and Angels," Alison
Lurie's "Truth About Lorin Jones," Isabel Colegate's "Deceits of Time" and A. S.
Byatt's "Possession": all of these novels feature biographers who slowly
discover that their subjects' lives echo or influence their own. In the course
of researching their books, they achieve not only an understanding of their
subjects, but a measure of self-knowledge as well.

In her latest novel, Celia Gittelson -- the author of "Saving Grace," a charming
first novel about a Pope who runs away from his job -- reinvents this familiar
formula, giving it new life with her finely hammered prose, her compassionately
drawn characters, her natural storytelling talents.

Ms. Gittelson's biographer is a shambling middle-aged fellow named Raphael
Alter, who owns and manages a run-down building on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan that he has inherited from his father. Alter is a modern, urban
variation of one of Henry James's timid observers: someone who has elected to
spend his life on the sidelines, protected by his detachment and safe from
emotional involvements. Alter has never been in love, never ventured into the
outside world. He lives in the apartment he grew up in as a boy, and counts the
building's handyman and the local mailman as his only friends. He is resigned to
the shabby condition of the building -- he will make only the most urgent
repairs, forgoing longterm renovation -- and his tenants regard him as a sour,
distant man.

For years now, Alter has eked out a marginal living writing essays and
biographies. His current project is a life of a poet named Maxwell Leibert, a
garrulous, hard-drinking poet, seemingly modeled, at least in some respects, on
Delmore Schwartz.

Leibert, Alter learns through his research, was married twice, fathered four
children (and possibly a fifth illegitimate one), and spent much of his free
time drinking and womanizing. He fell into a severe depression toward the end of
his life, exhibited increasingly paranoid behavior and died, in a freak accident
that may or may not have been a suicide.

Although Leibert at first seems like the very antithesis of Alter, who secretly
envies and deplores his hectic, discombobulated life, parallels between the two
men gradually emerge. Both suffer from depression, both hunger after literary
recognition, both feel at odds with the world about them.

In pursuit of the truth about Maxwell Leibert, Alter interviews everyone he can
find who knew him: a development that gives his creator, Ms. Gittelson, the
opportunity to create an engaging gallery of subsidiary characters. There is the
ancient psychiatrist, who treated the poet at the end of his life; the former
drinking buddy, who is now living out the last days of his life in a squalid
room; the possessive, nit-picking son, who worries that Alter will betray his
father.

Last but not least is Chloe, a beautiful but oddly melancholy woman, who writes
Alter a letter, suggesting that she has an explosive revelation to make about
Leibert that will permanently change posterity's view of the man. As Alter tries
to persuade her to trust him with this information, he finds himself -- much to
his surprise and discomfiture -- falling in love with his mysterious informant.

Writing with wit, compassion and a shrewdly observant eye, Ms. Gittelson does a
beautiful job of turning Alter's biographical detective work into a kind of
spiritual odyssey. Indeed, Alter's search for Leibert (and, in a sense, his
search for a new identity of his own) comes to recall the inquiry into faith and
responsibility conducted by the lapsed Pope in her last book.

Although the end of "Biography" feels a bit forced and self-conscious --
startling discoveries and heavily metaphorical events proliferate with alarming
speed in the last two chapters -- the reader is too immersed in Alter's life by
then to really mind. This novel not only fulfills the promise of Ms. Gittelson's
first book; it also validates the emergence of a wonderfully talented writer.

Last-second shot lifts Alter over CJ;
Kaila Howe swipes inbounds pass and races for winning layup to stun Eagles.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 340 words


SPRINGFIELD - At a timeout with what seemed to be 5.8 seconds left and the score
tied, a referee told Alter coach Chris Hart the time would be changed to 8
seconds.

Chaminade Julienne controlled possession, and the referee said he saw CJ coach
Duane Williams signaling for the break earlier.

"I thought, 'Oh, man, we're in trouble,' " Hart said.

But the extra time - and hard-nosed guard Kaila Howe - gave Alter just what it
needed. Howe tipped the inbounds pass near halfcourt, corralled the ball in a
scramble and scored with 1.6 seconds left to give Alter a 36-34 win in the
Division II regional final on Friday, March 12, at Springfield High School to
advance to the state tournament.

Alter (22-2) will play its state semifinal at 8 p.m. Thursday at the
Schottenstein Center in Columbus against Miami Trace.

The lead had already changed six times in the fourth quarter by the time CJ
lined up for its inbounds pass.

Then Howe got in the way. Asked if she glanced at the clock on her way to the
basket, Howe laughed: "I kind of had my eyes closed, so I didn't see much. I
opened them to make the layup."

And so Alter beat CJ in the rubber match for the two Girls Greater Cincinnati
League Grey North Division mates. Christie led Alter with 13 points and Howe
added seven.

Raytea Long led CJ (19-6) with 10 points, and Eagles senior and University of
Connecticut recruit Samarie Walker added six before fouling out on consecutive
offensive fouls with 4:11 left.

It was a defensive game throughout. CJ led 7-6 after the first quarter and 16-12
at halftime. Courtney Christie canned a long 3-pointer as the third quarter
expired to tie the score at 22, and the frantic fourth quarter ensued.

"We just tried to lift each other up, get some energy," Ashley Christie said.

Ashley Christie scored with 1:16 left to tie it, and CJ held the ball until
calling time out with 5.8 (and then 8) seconds left.

"We played the game we wanted to play, and we kept the score where we wanted
it," Williams said. "We just didn't take advantage of the opportunities we had."

Walker leads Eagles to upset of Knights;
Senior collects 22 points, 20 rebounds to help snap Alter's 17-game win streak.

FAIRBORN - Samarie Walker told herself, "Enough."

The Chaminade Julienne High School senior had lost two straight girls high
school basketball games to rival Alter, and entered the fourth quarter down
36-35.

"I told myself at the end of the third, 'This is my time.' I had to step up and
that's what I did," the University of Connecticut recruit said.

Walker responded with 10 of her team's 17 points in the fourth quarter and
blocked a couple shots to help CJ upset Alter 50-42 on Friday, Jan. 29. The win
snapped Alter's 17-game regular-season winning streak - including 15 straight
this season.

Walker had 22 points, 20 rebounds (14 defensive) and three blocks.

Alter (15-1, 6-1 Girls Greater Cincinnati League Grey North) entered ranked No.
1 in both the Division II state poll and Dayton Daily News rankings. CJ (12-5,
6-2 GGCL) was No. 4 in the DDN and No. 14 in the state.

Alter won the first meeting 46-45 on Dec. 16, but CJ made sure this outcome was
different with improved and aggressive defense and determination. The Eagles
held the Knights scoreless for 4:30 in the fourth quarter, and capped the win by
hitting 9 of 11 free throws over the final 2:47.

"You have to have confidence you can compete with someone," CJ first-year coach
Duane Williams said of getting over any mental hurdles. "If we lose this game,
another tough one down the stretch, we can say we're capable (of beating Alter)
but are they going to believe me?"

Simmone Gage added 11 points and Sierra Gage 10 for CJ. Ashley Christie led
Alter with 14 points and Allison Bockrath added seven points and grabbed 12
rebounds in a game that saw 14 lead changes.

The loss stung, but Alter figured one was coming sooner or later.

"We never expected to be undefeated," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "If we've
gone undefeated we tell our kids we haven't done a good job scheduling. We want
to be challenged. ... One thing about our kids this year is we learn from wins.
And you always learn a lot from a loss. If we recommit and refocus it could be a
good thing."

Big Easy job more difficult than ex-TRF chief expected: But it?s more rewarding,
too, as special events help renew city?s spirit.

BYLINE: By Ryan Lengerich

LENGTH: 785 words



Kathleen Alter landed in New Orleans on Aug.1, thrilled to start her job as
chief executive officer of French Quarter Festivals Inc. It was a chance to lead
a prominent events organization in a significant entertainment city.

The Big Easy meant warmer weather, rich history and tourism galore. She landed a
quaint apartment in the Garden District and adjusted to New Orleans, observing
its customs, people and attitudes.

She flew back to Fort Wayne on Aug. 28 to pick up her furniture. The next day,
Hurricane Katrina pummeled the Gulf Coast, buckling New Orleans' levy system,
killing more than 1,000 and leaving countless more homeless, displaced or
missing.

The Fort Wayne native, 42, thought maybe she could drive back to hard-hit New
Orleans a few days later, but it would be six weeks before her return.

"My family held me back and said, You can't go, you can't get in the city,'"
Alter said.

But she left in early October, and last week her successor Shannon White of
Dayton, Ohio, was named executive director for Fort Wayne's Three Rivers
Festival. Alter held the post for nearly nine years.

Her decision to depart dates back nearly a year. As is common in January, snow
blanketed Fort Wayne. Alter vowed it would be her last freezing winter.

"I'm not a fan of cold weather," she said, and that day she spotted an opening
in New Orleans -- her second favorite city (her favorite being Key West) -- and
applied.

French Quarter Festivals Inc. organizes three major annual events -- the French
Quarter Festival in April, Satchmo Summerfest in August and Christmas New
Orleans Style in December -- attracting more than 500,000 people. Her events are
clustered among renowned festival giants Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest.

She returned to the Garden District on Oct. 13. Her neighborhood, while
sustaining hurricane-force damage, had been spared the flooding. Some residents
had slowly filed back into the city, though many of the organization's board
members still have not returned. Under severe financial duress, the state
tourism board whacked Alter's funding, as she expected. Strapped for cash, Alter
laid off half her six-person staff, employees she hopes to be able to rehire
next month.

Christmas New Orleans Style is a month-long run of events headlined by about 20
concerts, drawing crowds as large as 1,300 per show. This month's abbreviated
event list features four concerts. The first concert, held last week, attracted
about 300 die-hards.

"There is a limited amount of things to do considering it is New Orleans, and it
is a city that usually doesn't shut down," she said. "The people that were there
were very grateful. They are just looking for things to do and ways to lift the
spirit."

Penny Reeh, Region 3 director for the International Festivals and Events
Association, has contacted festival organizers in locations devastated by
hurricanes Rita and Katrina. She supports Alter's decision to modify -- rather
than scrap -- the holiday festival.

"I think what she is doing is very wise to scale back the event and make it more
manageable financially and to put forth whatever resources are intact," Reeh
said. "It gives a morale boost that they are going ahead and progressing despite
of what happened."

Though each day she encounters disaster and heartbreak stories in local
newspapers, Alter is convinced New Orleans will rebuild and rebound.

"The passion comes from the people, and they love what their city stands for,
and they won't sit around and let New Orleans go to waste. It just won't
happen," Alter said.

She clings to the moral boost her organization provides. Social events are not
just sideshows and parties, but a form of rehabilitation.

"On one level my job is going to be the same as what I thought. On another level
it is much bigger," she said. "Now you are not just putting on an event, you are
trying to renew a city. So the scope of what you are doing is much more serious
and much bigger when you look at it that way."

EX-LEGISLATOR HITS THE COMEBACK TRAIL ALTER, A REPUBLICAN, BATTLES STRINGER, A;
DEMOCRAT AND EX-ST. LOUIS FIRE CAPTAIN

BYLINE: Phil Sutin Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: ZONE SOUTH; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 797 words


Bill Alter says he is attempting a comeback on Nov. 3 - in a slightly more
favorable state representative district but in an unsettled political climate.
Alter, a Republican from High Ridge, lost a bid for re-election to the House to
Jo Ann Karll, a Democrat from High Ridge, by 40 votes in the old 104th District.
After redistricting scrambled House seats in northern Jefferson County, Alter is
competing in the new 90th District, Karll in the new 105th.  In this election,
Larry Stringer of Springdale is Alter's Democratic opponent.  Alter says the new
90th is ''a little more Republican'' than the old 104th.  He lost House Springs
in Jefferson County but gained a largely unincorporated area in southwestern
Jefferson County, west of Ellisville and south of Chesterfield. The new district
goes as far north as Manchester Road.  Under normal circumstances, Alter says,
he could be more comfortable than he was two years ago. The political climate is
particularly unsettled this year.  ''I can't take anything for granted, because
a great many people are angry this year.'' Alter served from 1989 to 1991. He
was only the second Republican elected to the House in a generation from
traditionally Democratic Jefferson County.  State Rep. Jon Selsor, R-Kimmswick,
broke the Democrats' hold two years earlier.  Alter owns Alter Management Co.,
which is a sales manager for fashion jewelry.  Stringer is a retired St. Louis
fire captain, an executive in the firefighters union and a former lobbyist for
the union, in Jefferson City. On a number of issues, the two candidates are not
far apart.  Both look to Washington to solve health-care problems. Alter warns
that taxes needed to pay for a state plan would make Missouri less competitive
than neighboring states that did not have a plan. And people from these states
might come to Missouri for medical care at this state's expense, he says.
Stringer favors a single-payer, universal health-care system. Alter did not say
what approach the federal government should take.  Both are willing to loosen
some restrictions on issuing permits for concealed weapons.  Both favor state
regulation of church-run day-care centers for safety.  ''The centers should be
regulated tightly for safety,'' Stringer says.  Center operators, he says
''won't do that themselves.'' But Alter voted against a proposal for such
regulations when he was in the House. He says that effort intruded too much into
the operations of the church-run groups.  On issues where the two differ,
Stringer says the state's abortion laws are ''OK the way they are.'' He says the
state could pay for abortions for some destitute women who have been raped or
face other dire circumstances.  Alter opposes abortions and public funding for
them.  Stringer opposes a school-voucher system in which public money would go
to schools of the parents' choice, whether public, private or parochial. He says
that the state should support public schools and that a voucher plan could be
too expensive.  Alter says the state should set up a pilot voucher program to
see if the idea works.  Stringer opposes term limits. Alter says term limits are
acceptable but are not the answer to improving legislative bodies. He says the
public needs to watch what their lawmakers are doing and hold them accountable.
Campaign finance reports show that Alter had raised nearly $13,000 by late
October. He received contributions from political action committees representing
bankers, contractors, doctors,Ford Motor Co., Hallmark Cards, insurance
companies, the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, the Missouri Conservative Union,
Missouri Eagle Forum, the National Rifle Association, telephone companies, the
University of Missouri at St. Louis and Union Electric Co.  Stringer has raised
more than $7,600, reports show. He has raised contributions from political
action committees representing automobile dealers, bankers, beer wholesalers and
the firefighters, Teamsters, United Auto Workers and other unions.
Anheuser-Busch Co's. Inc. and the campaign committee of State Rep. Gail
Chatfield, D-St. Louis, have made contributions.  BILL ALTER Hometown: High

LITERARY STUDIES
HEBREW AND MODERNITY
By Robert Alter.
Indiana University,
cloth, $27.95; paper, $10.95.

"Even the speaker of up-to-the-minute street Hebrew cannot escape the long
history of the language," Robert Alter argues in "Hebrew and Modernity," an
intriguing collection of previously published essays. Mr. Alter emphasizes the
longevity and widespread use of Hebrew, as well as the predicament of
"communication that is carried out through Hebrew embedded in a Russian
conversation . . . conveyed retrospectively in a Yiddish narrative." Mr. Alter,
a professor of Hebrew and comparative literature at the University of
California, Berkeley, analyzes modern Hebrew literature's "abiding oddness,"
and, in "Kafka's Father, Agnon's Mother, Bellow's Cousins," offers a lively
dissection of Jewish domestic neurosis in three different languages. Most
accessible are his studies of the Israeli novelist S. Y. Agnon, "fabulist,
symbolist, satirist, anecdotalist, moralist, adept of the macabre and the
supernatural," and the Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai, with his "wry
self-deprecation" and "affinity for real things." Some of the concepts he
discusses might be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the work cited. Yet Mr.
Alter ingeniously weaves in quotations that bring his points to life.   SUSAN

Knights are fine with early start;
Division IV title game scheduled for 10 a.m. kickoff.;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALLALTER

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 518 words


Matt Link (left) and Conor Ryan have provided strong defense for Alter, which
easily won all of its playoff games until last week. The Knights showed in that
victory that they can handle adversity, rallying in the fourth quarter against
Kenton.

Playing for a high school football state championship is special for any team.
But at 10 a.m. on a weekday?

That's the collateral cost of moving championship weekend from Massillon and
Canton after a 24-year run to Columbus. And Alter drew that nontraditional
kickoff start time.

Alter (14-0) will try to complete a perfect season against Cleveland Benedictine
(13-1) in the Division IV state championship at 10 a.m. Friday at Ohio State
University.

According to Alter coach Ed Domsitz, it wouldn't have mattered if the teams were
to kick off at 6 a.m. on the banks of the Olentangy River.

"There are only two variables, we're either going to win the game or lose the
game," he said while addressing statewide media this week. "Whether it's 10 a.m.
or 3 p.m. or 7:30, we need to be ready to play. And if we're not, then we're
14-1."

All the title games will be at Ohio Stadium, where the Buckeyes play. The
addition of a seventh division last season and just one location forced the Ohio
High School Athletic Association to spread games over three days.

The D-III title game begins the action at 7:30 p.m. today. Alter gets the fi rst
of three games Friday. The Division I title game, often the most attended, was
moved back to a 3 p.m. Saturday start so as not to directly interfere with OSU's
8:17 p.m. kickoff against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship game in
Indianapolis.

Instead, Coldwater will play Canton Central Catholic in the 8 p.m. Saturday D-V
title game.

Many state championship contests have early starts such as 10 a.m. when multiple
teams are playing at the same venue on the same day. Football title games had
been moved back to 10:30 a.m., and now even earlier.

Alter has played at 7 and 7:30 p.m. on Fridays and 1 p.m. Saturday at
Mc-Nicholas. The Knights will stay over in Columbus tonight rather than make the
trip early Friday.

As inconvenient as that early kickoff seems, playing for their third state title
and at the home of the Buckeyes should serve as a wakeup call.

"It's great to be playing at Ohio Stadium," Domsitz said. "That amps it up quite
a bit for the kids and for the coaches."

Alter wasn't its dominant self in last week's 25-22 state semifi nal defeat of
Kenton, but it might have been the Knights' most clutch eff ort. Alter trailed
for one of the few times in the fourth quarter and rallied to advance.

That impressed Domsitz more than any of the blowout wins.

"I tell our kids the teams that end up playing in the state championships in
Week 15, not only do you have to be fortunate in avoiding injuries, but you've
got to be able to sustain it mentally," he said. "You're talking about an extra
half of season. That's where a lot of teams have problems trying to focus and
being ready to play going into that 12th, 13th, 14th week."

Tie Bar plans to close Naperville warehouse

BYLINE: By Anna Marie Kukec, Daily Herald Business Writer akukec@dailyherald.com

SECTION: BIZ LEDGER; Pg. 30

LENGTH: 396 words


The Tie Bar, known for its neckware worn by Hollywood greats Bruce Willis, Jay
Z, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and others, will close its warehouse in
Naperville on Aug. 18 and lay off about 35 workers.

Revenues at the Chicago-based company have been increasing each year, and in
order for the trend to continue, the tie company decided to outsource its
warehouse and delivery services to Austin, Texas-based Newgistics, which will
operate the warehouse in Kentucky, said Tie Bar CEO Michael Alter.

The company only sells on the Internet and does not have stores.

"This was not an easy decision for us and we are doing our best to support and
help those transitioning," Alter said. "The company growth we have enjoyed made
this move inevitable in order to continue delivering our customers the service
levels we strive for on their behalf."

Greg and Gina Shugar started The Tie Bar about 10 years ago when they lived in
Naperville. They now live out of state after they sold the company in 2013. The
Tie Bar became a destination for stylish men's accessories, such as neckties,
bow ties, tie bars, pocket squares and socks. The popularity of the trendy ties
has been growing.

Celebrities have sported the ties on the red carpet, for covers of GQ and other
magazines.

The company is growing. Revenues were about $10 million in 2012 and about $16
million in 2013. About a 40 percent increase in revenues is expected in 2014,
Alter said.

Employees in Naperville have been offered severance packages and will be
provided job search guidance and counseling, Alter said.

The company decided to outsource the warehouse operations out of state, instead
of staying in Illinois, because "this was the best choice," Alter said.

"We did an extensive search for the best provider, based on customer service and
delivery times," Alter said.

The Tie Bar opened its headquarters in Chicago in May and plans to hire
additional marketing and technology employees there.

Prior to opening the downtown office, all employees worked in Naperville. The
company, without the warehouse, has 25 workers, Alter said.

The business will remain based on the Internet and has no plans to open stores
or offer products for women, he said.

"We plan to grow our product lines, including for socks and belts, and increase
awareness of who we are," Alter said. "But we will remain a company that sells
men's accessories only."

C-SPAN bus visit puts politics in spotlight for Alter students;
Cable TV network tour also hit Columbus and Cincinnati

BYLINE: By Jeremy P. Kelley Staff Writer

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD1

LENGTH: 366 words


KETTERING - High school students run the gamut from very interested in politics
and government to completely apathetic, so Alter High School made it interesting
last week, welcoming the C-SPAN Digital Bus to its campus.

C-SPAN is a cable television network that airs government and public affairs
programs. C-SPAN's Digital Buses have been touring the nation for 17 years,
teaching school and community groups about public affairs.

The Dayton-area stop was part of an Ohio swing that also hit Columbus and
Cincinnati last week.

Thanks to Time Warner Cable, Alter students toured the high-tech bus Aug. 25 and
learned about C-SPAN's online video library that can be used for classroom
research.

"I think it helped a lot because in our classroom we just learn off the
PowerPoint (presentation)," said Alter senior John Griffin of Centerville. "But
this was seeing (videos) actually from the government people, so it was easier
to learn, for me anyway."

Griffin and classmate Jeremiah Shaw, a senior from Yellow Springs, said they
like the idea of supplementing what they see in class or on TV by checking out
detailed videos in the C-SPAN online "classroom."

C-SPAN production specialist Steve Devoney was honest with the students about
what they'd find.

"We have some stuff that's very, very interesting, and some stuff you'd never
want to watch in a million years, like a six-hour House subcommittee meeting,"
he said.

But C-SPAN's Doug Hemmig said the searchable online library gives Alter's
soon-to-be voters the ability to find what they need, so they can treat
30-second news sound bites as starting points for research, rather than the end
of debate on a topic.

Matt Deters, Alter's advanced placement government teacher, told his students to
watch CSPAN for homework, saying he hoped the bus and exposure to the network
would make the students more informed about journalism and their government.

"They're already getting it in class, but this gives a practical application,"
said Jeff Plate, Alter's director of institutional advancement.

"It really is about the political process, about being inquisitive and learning
how things interrelate. ... This helps to connect the dots for the kids, I
think."

Lourdes Lambert was principal at East End Accelerated Community School in
Day-ton.

KETTERING - On Thursday, Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis Schnurr named Lourdes
Lambert principal of Alter High School.

Lambert had served as interim principal of the Catholic high school in Kettering
since the beginning of the school year, and will assume the full principal
position in the 2012-13 school year. The school draws students from throughout
the Dayton area, predominantly in south suburbs.

"Mrs. Lambert is a woman of tremendous positive energy, enthusiasm and vision,"
Schnurr said. "In her few months as interim principal, Mrs. Lambert has
impressed the Alter community with her strong leadership ability and inspiring
faith."

Lambert initially was hired as assistant principal at Alter in the spring to
fill the position of Matt Sableski, who left Alter at the end of the 2010-11
school year for his alma mater, Carroll High School.

Shortly after that, Alter Principal Nicole Brainard was hired by Cincinnati's
McAuley High School, where she went to school. She had been at Alter for four
years.

Lambert, a native of Florida, served as principal in the King William County
Public Schools in Virginia and at the East End Accelerated Community School in
Dayton.

She also worked as an independent contractor for the Thomas B. Fordham
Foundation and Keys to Improving Dayton Schools.

Lambert, who began her career teaching Spanish and English as a second language,
earned her bachelor's degree in English education from Florida International
University and her master's degree in education from Virginia Commonwealth
University. She also is a doctoral candidate in educational leadership.

Lambert said she is excited to know she will continue as principal at Alter.

"The students, the faculty, the staff, the families and the community are simply
amazing," she said.

The Rev. Jim Manning, Alter president, said Lambert has done an extraordinary
job since she came to the school.

"We are so blessed to have such a talented and faith-filled leader as our
principal," Manning said.

Tie Bar to close Naperville warehouse, lay off workers Closing: New jobs planned
for Chicago

BYLINE: By Anna Marie Kukec, Daily Herald Business Writer akukec@dailyherald.com

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 404 words


The Tie Bar, known for its neckware worn by Hollywood greats Bruce Willis, Jay
Z, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and others, will close its warehouse in
Naperville on Aug. 18 and lay off about 35 workers.

Revenues at the Chicago-based company have been increasing each year, and in
order for the trend to continue, the tie company decided to outsource its
warehouse and delivery services to Austin, Texas-based Newgistics, which will
operate the warehouse in Kentucky, said Tie Bar CEO Michael Alter. The company
only sells on the Internet and does not have stores.

"This was not an easy decision for us and we are doing our best to support and
help those transitioning," Alter said. "The company growth we have enjoyed made
this move inevitable in order to continue delivering our customers the service
levels we strive for on their behalf."

Greg and Gina Shugar started The Tie Bar about 10 years ago when they lived in
Naperville. They now live out of state after selling to new owners in 2013. The
Tie Bar became a destination for stylish men's accessories, such as neckties,
bow ties, tie bars, pocket squares and socks. The popularity of the trendy ties
has been growing.

Celebrities have sported the ties on the

red carpet, for covers of GQ and other magazines.

The company is growing. Revenues were about $10 million in 2012 and about $16
million in 2013. About a 40 percent increase in revenues is expected in 2014,
Alter said.

Employees in Naperville have been offered severance packages and will be
provided job search guidance and counseling, Alter said.

The company decided to outsource the warehouse operations out of state, instead
of staying in Illinois, because "this was the best choice," Alter said.

"We did an extensive search for the best provider, based on customer service and
delivery times," Alter said.

The Tie Bar opened its headquarters in Chicago in May and plans to hire
additional marketing and technology employees there. Prior to opening the
downtown office, all employees worked in Naperville. The company, without the
warehouse, has 25 workers, Alter said.

The business will remain based on the Internet and has no plans to open stores
or offer products for women, he said.

"We plan to grow our product lines, including for socks and belts, and increase
awareness of who we are," Alter said. "But we will remain a company that sells
men's accessories only."

Kettering sets rivalry aside to cheer both teams at state;
Fairmont girls fall; Alter takes the court today

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

LENGTH: 351 words


KETTERING - After practice, the Alter High School girls basketball team loaded
up the bus and left for Columbus to watch their Fairmont High neighbors from 1.9
miles down the road.

Fairmont lost Friday night, March 19, in the state semifinal, but the Firebirds
will stick around in Columbus today to watch Alter play for a state
championship.

Fairmont coach Tim Cogan said, "With Alter right next to us, them coming out and
watching us, we'll watch them (today) in the state final. I think it's just
great for the city of Kettering."

Alter Principal Nikki Brainard agreed.

"It could be that some of the kids know each other," Brainard said of the
Knights cheering on Fairmont. "But it really and truly just is the Kettering
connection."

Brainard said the schools cooperate on community service projects like Partners
for Healthy Youth: "We're both in the state tournament this far in. Let's go and
support them, and you hope that, in turn, maybe they'd turn around and cheer for
us, too."

The Knights (24-2) play at 2 p.m. today in the Division II title game against
Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown (22-4), a team Alter met in each of the past two
tourneys.

After good runs in the tournament the past seven years, Fairmont finally earned
its way to Columbus for its first state final four - complete with a police
escort for its charter bus ride Friday morning.

"It livened up the community and put a spark in peoples' eyes, which is always
neat," Cogan said.

The Firebirds got 25 points from University of Dayton signee Cassie Sant and 13
points from Holley Carey in a 61-55 loss to Toledo Waite in a Division I
semifinal. Fairmont finished its best year 22-3.

Alter and Fairmont weren't the only area neighbors to make it to state. Among
the Division IV state semifinalists, Minster and Fort Loramie high schools are
4.2 miles apart.

Minster was defeated 49-48 by Berlin Hiland on Friday, while Fort Loramie lost
49-46 against Canal Winchester Harvest Prep.

In D-III, Middletown Madison faces Findlay Liberty-Benton today for the state
championship.

Alter Upsets Monson in Utah Treasurer's Race; Knoll Is Surprise Winner in
Pennsylvania Contest

                          November 10, 1988, Thursday

By Jan Paschal

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


In one of the biggest upsets among the races for state treasurer, incumbent
Edward T. Alter of Utah, a Republican, defeated his popular Democratic opponent,
Art Monson, after trailing Mr. Monson in the polls.

Mr. Alter, well known for his outspoken support of a constitutional amendment to
protect tax-exempt bonds, won a third four-year term by garnering about 54% of
the votes cast, according to United Press International. Mr. Monson, who has
served as Salt Lake County treasurer since 1974, got 46% of the ballots cast.
Mr. Monson gained prominence in Utah through his advocacy of property tax
relief.

In another surprise victory, Catherine Baker Knoll, a Democrat, became the
second woman in Pennsylvania's 212-year history to win election to statewide
office by defeating Republican Philip English, the controller of Erie, in the
state treasurer's race.

Ms. Knoll, who has held personnel management positions at two Pittsburgh
hospitals, received about 55.8% of the votes cast, and Mr. English snared about
44.2% of the ballots.

In Rhode Island, Anthony Solomon, a former state treasurer, easily won his old
job back with 58% of the vote. His Republican opponent, Gerald Goldstein, a
businessman and Warwick City Council member, had waged a campaign that was
highly critical of Mr. Solomon's past job performance. Mr. Goldstein received
38% of the vote, and the independent candidate, Frank Corrente, an accountant,
received 4%.

In a hotly contested race, incumbent Missouri treasurer Wendell Bailey, a
Republican, barely squeaked by his popular Democratic opponent, state Rep. Bob
Holden. Mr. Bailey had 50.16% of the votes cast, compared with 48.88% for Mr.
Holden, according to UPI.

Elsewhere, incumbent state treasurers in North Carolina, North Dakota, and
Oregon appeared to be easily holding their ground.

In North Carolina, Harlan Boyles, the Democratic incumbent, won a fourth term,
defeating Nancy Lake Coward, the Republican candidate and owner of a state
license tag agency in Asheville, N.C.

In North Dakota, Bob Hanson, the incumbent Democratic state treasurer, was
re-elected to a second four-year term, according to unofficial election returns.
His Republican opponent was Steve Easton, a certified public accountant and an
attorney.

In Oregon, the incumbent treasurer, Tony Meeker, a Republican, was re elected
with 57% of the vote, according to unofficial returns. His Democratic opponent,
Steve Anderson, a probate attorney, received 40% of the vote. The Libertarian
candidate, Steve Buckstein, an investment banker, netted 4% of the ballots cast.

In Vermont, Paul Ruse Jr., the Democratic candidate and deputy state treasurer,
will get a crack at the top job by winning more than 50% of the vote. He
defeated Republican Wayne Walker, a tax attorney and Harvard Law School
graduate.

In the State of Washington, where neither candidate for state treasurer was well
known, the Democratic candidate, veteran state Rep. Dan Grimm, captured 52% of
the vote. His Republican opponent, Andy McLauchlan, a former budget adviser to
U.S. Sen. Dan Evans, grabbed 48% of the vote.

Alter tight end Hart impresses Nebraska;
Junior commits to Cornhuskers' 2013 class as combo TE/fullback.;
Covering your hometown teams Alter High School football

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 311 words


Alter's Greg Hart was recruited to be an H-back - part tight end, part fullback
- at Nebraska.

KETTERING - Greg Hart and Malik Zaire have all the backing they need to tempt
Alter High School football coach Ed Domsitz to open up the Knights' wishbone
offense: Scholarships to Nebraska and Notre Dame.

Hart, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound junior tight end, verbally committed this week to
the Cornhuskers. Zaire, a left-handed quarterback, pledged with the Fighting
Irish earlier this year. Neither compiled enough stats to even be among leaders
in the Greater Catholic League North Division.

"I have no idea," said Hart about his receptions last season. "We don't really
throw a lot."

That both Hart and Zaire could land at the traditional football powers is more a
tribute to their unlimited potential than numbers.

Hart sided with Nebraska after making an official visit last weekend. He also
weighed offers from Northwestern, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisville, North Carolina
State, Pittsburgh, Virginia, Wake Forest and Boston College. Ohio, Cincinnati,
Akron and Kent State also wanted him.

He also played defensive end for the Knights (10-1) last season. He'll likely
move to a slot receiver this fall and double as an outside linebacker or
defensive end.

Nebraska head coach Bo Pelini sold Hart as his No. 1 H-back recruit. The
position is a combination tight end/fullback. Hart is the seventh member of the
Class of 2013 to commit to Nebraska. He's also the sixth area junior to verbally
commit.

"Nebraska is definitely a great program with tradition, just like Alter," he
said.

"They're not really focused on stats. They're focused more on the potential that
they see in every player. They see your frame and your size and your ceiling. If
they can see your potential, they'll definitely take a chance on you."

Mainland millionaires replace HK investors in US commercial market

BYLINE: DON LYONS

SECTION: PROPERTY POST; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 355 words


A growing number of mainland investors with between US$ 25 million and $ 50
million to spend are investing in the commercial property markets in California
and Hawaii.

Financial Capital Investment Co (FCI) managing director Richard Alter said the
mainlanders had replaced Hong Kong investors, whose numbers had diminished since
the regional economic crisis.

Mr Alter, who specialises in helping overseas-born Chinese living in Asia invest
in the US commercial property market, said that since the Asian economic
upheaval last year, many of his investment clients in Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Indonesia had all but disappeared from the market.

"The business from Hong Kong has fallen off by 50 per cent at least," he said.

Anyone involved in the Hong Kong stock market had left the property investment
market completely.

Instead, more of his clients wanting to sink money into the US were coming from
the mainland.

"We are dealing with wealthy individual investors from Shanghai and Beijing," Mr
Alter said.

There also were mainland corporations with offices in Hong Kong which were
interested in investing in California and Hawaii property.

Mr Alter said about 75 per cent of the commercial property he sold to Chinese
investors was owned by Japanese.

"The Japanese are in trouble right now and a lot of the companies want to sell
their properties," he said.

Economic reforms had created a few very wealthy people on the mainland.

"I am not talking about thousands of people," he said. "I am talking about
hundreds of people with this sort of money to spend."

Mr Alter said mainland investments in US property had more than doubled in the
last year or so, with FCI handling more than $ 100 million for mainland
investors in that period.

Mainlanders were keen to put their money in cities such as San Francisco and Los
Angeles, where a Chinese infrastructure already existed, he said.

These investors were reaping yields of 10 per cent and asset appreciation of
15-18 per cent.

Many of these commercial properties were selling at 50-60 per cent below their
former value, he said.

Passion for landscaping blossoms into a career

BYLINE: HEREABOUTS SANDRA BAER

SECTION: CENTERVILLE AND WASHINGTON TWP; Pg. RH-2

LENGTH: 436 words


For Mark Grunkemeyer of Washington Twp., the world is truly a very green place.

Grunkemeyer owns Buckeye Ecocare, a Centerville-based company that specializes
in residential and commercial lawn care and tree and shrub care. In addition,
Grunkemeyer also gives presentations about lawn care to groups as a part of the
volunteer work he does for the Ohio Lawn Care Association and the Ohio Turfgrass
Foundation.

"I love working outside and I love working with people," said Grunkemeyer, of
his decision to start a lawn care company.

Grunkemeyer was born in Kettering in 1954. He moved to Centerville in 1960 with
his parents, John and June Grunkemeyer, who currently live in Fort Myers, Fla.,
and five siblings, including Michael Grunkemeyer, a retired Kettering paramedic
and fire fighter.

Grunkemeyer attended Incarnation School and Archbishop Alter High School, in
Kettering, where he spent four years on the varsity baseball team and was a
member of the soccer team before graduating in 1972.

"It was the very first team," said Grunkemeyer of the Alter soccer team he
joined as a junior.

While a student at Alter, Grunkemeyer discovered a passion for landscaping after
working at a golf course.

"One of my summer jobs was at a community golf course working with Hank Chafin
of Dayton," Grunkemeyer said. "He had a four-year degree in agronomy from Purdue
University and he said to me, 'If you love this so much, why don't you study
it?'"

After graduating from high school, Grunkemeyer took Chafin's advice and went on
to earn an associate degree in turf grass management from Ohio State University
Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster. While attending a college party, he
met his wife, the former Peggy Amann, a 1973 Alter High School graduate from
Kettering, who was studying in the executive secretarial program at the
University of Cincinnati.

While completing an internship at the Brown's Run Golf Course in Middletown,
Grunkemeyer became interested in the emerging field of residential lawn care.
After completing the internship, he accepted a position with a major natural
lawn care company where he remained until 1984 when he and his wife founded
their own company.

"She handled the administrative side," said Grunkemeyer, who has two children,
Beth, who married Alter graduate, Chad Campbell, has two children and lives in
Charlotte, N.C. and Tom Grunkemeyer, an Alter graduate, who studied economics
and marketing at the University of Dayton and worked for the Berry Company for
two years before starting a job on the ground level at Buckeye Ecocare.

As the first president of Alter High School, the Rev. James Manning will focus
on community relations and eventually, development for the school.

"I'm trying to get myself out there," said Manning, who is also pastor at St.
Albert the Great Parish in Kettering.

The announcement that Manning will serve as president is another step in the
change in the management structure at Alter High School. Manning was asked to
serve as president by the school's board of trustees.

The board itself is a new entity, and has been in place for about a year. Daniel
Pilarczyk, archbishop of the Diocese of Cincinnati then approved the request for
Manning to be appointed as president.

Although presidents have been a mainstay at many schools run by religious
orders, Alter is the first high school owned and operated by the Diocese of
Cincinnati to have a president.

"The majority of the Catholic high schools in the archdiocese that are operated
by somebody else, usually religious orders, do have a structure where they have
both a president and a principal," said Dan Andriacco, director of
communications for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

"There are others (schools) that have considered it and rejected it, and others
who are still considering it." Alter's board of trustees has started committees
for facilities, finance, development and academics, said Kirsten MacDougal,
director of marketing and communications for Alter.

Before the board and president position were established, "it was all on the
principal's plate," Mac-Dougal said.

Now, Alter Principal Sister Katie Hoelscher can focus on running the school
itself, while the board and president focus on the external operations.

The principal now reports to the president, and the president to the board. The
archbishop must ultimately approve the board of trustee's ideas, plans and
proposed changes.

"The diocese is giving more control to the local level," Manning said. It is
"delegating authority in certain areas to the board."

A native of Beavercreek, Manning graduated from Carroll High School. He was
ordained in 1975. He has master's degrees in philosophy and theology and a
master's in education from Xavier University.

Manning was associate pastor from 1988-91 at St. Henry in Dayton. In 1991, he
became pastor at St. Albert.

Among best stories of '16: Alter's teams tough to beat;
HIGH SCHOOLS

SECTION: ; Pg. C10

LENGTH: 1034 words


The top story: Dunbar missed the playoffs because of two forfeits.

As is the norm if you've followed area high school athletics, 2016 was full of
ups and downs and surprises.

Here are our top seven stories of the year:

7. Alter girls basketball: The 2015-16 Division II state championship was theirs
to lose. The Knights had played in the two previous D-II title games and were
the defending champs. More important, Alter was loaded with a starting lineup
that featured at least two NCAA D-I players in senior Haley Combs (Northern
Kentucky) and juniors Braxtin Miller (Oklahoma State signee) and Libby Bazelak
(Duquesne).

Sure enough, Alter capped a 28-2 season by walloping Ottawa-Glandorf 74-48 in
the state final at Ohio State University's Schottenstein Center. Miller was the
D-II final four MVP and had 33 points, 10 rebounds, four steals and three
assists in the final.

Alter also was the wire-to-wire Associated Press D-II state poll champ,
concluding an unprecedented three-season run for co-coaches Chris Hart and
Kendal Peck. Alter was a combined 87-3 with two D-II state titles, a D-II state
runner-up and a 50-game regular-season winning streak.

6. Alter boys and girls soccer:

Yes, more Knights. That's because the boys and girls teams each won a state
championship this past fall at MAPFRE Stadium in Columbus on the same weekend,
the fifth time in Ohio soccer history that had happened.

Lauren Dietz scored two goals and assisted on Grace Haines' goal in a 3-0 defeat
of Chagrin Falls in the girls D-II title game. Alter (18-2-2), an established
girls soccer power, won its first state title.

The Knights boys defeated Richfield Revere 1-0 in double overtime the next day.
Junior Ty Borton hit the winner on an assist from senior Scott Beinlich for
Alter (21-1-2) in the D-II championship.

That was the fourth state title for Alter's boys, but the first since 1998.

5. Football state championships: This was more noteworthy for who didn't win
state titles at Ohio Stadium in Columbus: Trot-wood-Madison (D-III) and
Cold-water (D-V).

Trotwood shut down postseason nemesis Toledo Central Catholic and its Mr.
Football, senior running back Michael Warren, 36-0 in a state semifinal at Lima.
But the Rams (12-3) had no answer for defendingstatechampAkronArchbishop Hoban
the following week and fell 30-0. Still, it was the seventh straight year
Trotwood had played in the final four and the fifth time since 2010 it had
played in a championship game.

Coldwater (13-2) had a streak of four state titles snapped by Canton Central
Catholic, 16-13. Cold-water had beaten CCC in the two previous D-V title games.

That was one of three title games that featured Midwest Athletic Conference
teams.

MarionLocaldefeatedCuyahoga Heights 21-17 to win the D-VI title. That was the
sixth straight year the Flyers (14-1) had played for a state title; they lost
only in the 2015 game. Minster (10-5) completed the MAC attack, falling 24-6 to
Warren John F. Kennedy in the D-VII title game.

4. Premier Health Flyin' to the Hoop: The boys basketball midseason invite-only
shootout at Fairmont's Trent Arena is must-see for college coaches who are
bidding for the nation's best players. Numerous Flyin' alums have become NBA
draft picks since creator Eric Horstman presented his first Flyin' in 2003.

It's now a nationally renowned event with 37 teams in 20 games over the Martin
Luther King holiday weekend. For the first time in 2017, a girls game will be in
the mix: Alter vs. Cleveland St. Joseph Academy.

3. Josh Myers, Miamisburg football: The 6-foot-6, 310-pound offensive lineman is
as sure an incoming hit at Ohio State as this area has ever produced. A
consensus top five player in the nation by all recruiting services, the
not-so-gentle giant was the first in the Class of 2017 to commit to the
Buckeyes, way back after his sophomore season.

He graduated early and will participate in spring ball for the Buckeyes.

2. Greater Western Ohio Conference expansion: The area's largest affiliation
super-sized itself by adding Tippecanoe and Stebbins, both of which left the
Central Buckeye Conference. That bolstered the GWOC to a robust 20 teams and
triggered a realignment into four divisions.

American North: Vandalia-Butler, Greenville, Piqua, Sidney, Troy and Tipp.

American South: Fairborn, Stebbins, Trotwood, West Carrollton and Xenia.

National East: Beavercreek, Centerville, Fairmont, Springfield and Wayne.

National West: Lebanon, Miamis-burg, Northmont and Springboro.

1. Dunbar football forfeits, investigations: This still isn't resolved.

Dunbar appeared destined to complete a 9-1 regular season and qualify for the
D-IV playoffs with one of the City League's most dominant teams in a decade,
maybe longer. Instead, the Wolverines were forced to forfeit Weeks 9-10 games
after using an academically ineligible player.

The collateral effect of reshuffling second-level playoff points following those
forfeitures also knocked Princeton (D-II) and Piqua (D-III) out of the
postseason.

Players who are ruled ineligible for various reasons are common every school
year, in all sports. But the effect is magnified for football because it's the
only sport in which teams must qualify for the postseason based on computer
points. Pete Pullen resigned as Dunbar's athletic director soon after but
remains the Wolverines' highly successful boys basketball coach.

What took this to another level was the accusation by Dunbar coaches that new
Dayton Public Schools Athletic Director Mark Baker instructed Dunbar to lose or
forfeit a Week 10 game against Belmont so both City League teams would qualify
for the playoffs.

Superintendent Rhonda Corr issued a statement that said a DPS investigation had
ended after determining Baker hadn't told Dunbar to lose or forfeit the Belmont
game.

The Ohio High School Athletic Association likely will conclude its investigation
this month.

It's unprecedented subject matter for the OHSAA, which oversees 820 high schools
and has been in existence since 1907.

Among the potential consequences for Dunbar are no football playoffs for an
undetermined amount of seasons, association suspensions and fines.

Cable to air Alter vs. LeBron

BYLINE: Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 452 words


This week marks the 10th anniversary of Alter's Division II boys high school
basketball state championship loss to Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary and LeBron
James.

Time Warner Cable will reach into its vault and show that 2003 game at 7 tonight
(TWC Channel 311 and 1311 HD).

Why?

Because if both teams win their Thursday state semifinals, they'll play for
another title on Saturday in Columbus.

Alter led that game 19-14 at halftime before the Irish rallied around you know
who for a 50-46 win. James scored 25 points and had 11 rebounds.

It was a rematch of their regular-season game at the University of Dayton Arena,
where SVSM destroyed Alter 73-40. "The Chosen One" drew a sold-out crowd to UD
during a Sun-day afternoon snowstorm in which residents were advised to stay
indoors.

A senior that season, it would be the third state title for SVSM during James'
career. Ironically, all three of those title games were against area teams:
Greeneview in 2000, Miami East in 2001 and Alter in 2003. Roger Bacon beat SVSM
in the 2002 final.

Alter (21-5) plays Columbus Watterson (26-1) at 8:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ohio
State University's Schottenstein Center. Akron SVSM (19-9) meets Warren (26-1)
at 5:15 p.m.

The D-II title game is 1: 30 p.m. on Saturday, also at the Schott. All four
finals will be carried live on TWC Channel 99.

Realignment: A peewee football program has formed to mirror the Greater Miami
Conference. Dave Taylor, president of the Hamilton Jr. Blue Stars Youth Football
and Cheer Organization, reports that the Greater Miami Youth Football Conference
is now a reality.

The peewee league includes organizations that feed Hamilton, Fairfield,
Middletown, Sycamore, Lakota East and Lakota West. Taylor said Colerain and
Mason will join in 2014.

The GMYFC is for youths kindergarten through sixth grade and plays fall weekend
games.

Next level: Meghan Robinson, a 5-foot-9 forward from Madison, has committed to
play basketball for Miami-Middle-town University.

? Samantha Cash of Miami East will join teammate Allison Morrett in furthering
their volleyball careers at Tennessee Tech. Cash was first -team All-Ohio for
the Vikings following last season's Division III state title run.

? Alter senior Sarah Jansing has committed to play soccer at Ursuline College,
an NCAA DII program at suburban Cleveland.

It's an honor: Mason boys basketball coach Greg Richards is one of six winners
of the Bob Arnzen Award. He'll be honored by the Ohio High School Basketball
Coaches Association during the state tournament Saturday in Columbus.

The award is for coaches who have spent 20 or more years coaching at the same
school.

Alter falls to Walsh Jesuit;
The Warriors score two first-half goals, then use an extra defender to hold off
the Knights.

BYLINE: By Greg Billing Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B10

LENGTH: 408 words


COLUMBUS - Alter High School's scouting report on Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit
was dead on. Unfortunately for the Knights, so was the Warriors' ranking in the
boys soccer state poll.

Walsh Jesuit backed up its Division II poll title with the state championship,
using a pair of first-half goals to beat Alter, 2-0, Saturday at Columbus Crew
Stadium. Walsh won its third state title, while Alter was denied its fifth in
front of 1,252 spectators who braved a hard rain and gusty winds.

"I don't think I've seen a team of that caliber in many, many years, and we've
been at this a long time," said Alter coach Bob Ellis. "They can possess the
ball. They can pass the ball. They can trap the ball. Don't get me wrong, they
can be beat. Today, we just didn't have what it took to take them down."

Winning the coin toss would have helped. Alter didn't get the north end and the
coveted wind at the Knights' back like they wanted to start the match. Walsh
(21-2) took advantage with goals in the seventh minute and 24th minute. By the
time Alter (18-3-1) had the wind advantage in the second half, the rain had
stopped.

"It was pretty hard to see, actually," Alter senior midfielder Kyle Bertrams
said. "That was the best team we've played. They passed well, shot well and did
a lot of things right."

Alter, ranked No. 5 in the final poll, nearly matched them. Alter junior
Nicholas Royer had a nice header with 16 minutes left that was saved. A minute
later, he got a shot past charging keeper Matt Weigand only to see defender Lee
Niedenthal swoop in and boot it away.

"They had very few weak spots," Ellis said. "We were told the goalie was a
little bit weak, but he made some superb saves in the last 10 minutes."

The Knights led in shots (12-11) and shots on goal (8-7), but couldn't get one
past Weigand or the Warriors' defense. Walsh kept an extra defender back in the
second half to protect that lead. Not that tying or even netting the go-ahead
goal was much of an option. The Warriors ended the postseason outscoring seven
opponents 36-2 with five shutouts. They had 13 shutouts this season.

Coming back from two goals down is tough in any match, let alone against a team
such as Walsh in the title match. That was on the Knights minds, too.

"If it was any other game, probably not," senior Michael Glaser said of worrying
about a comeback. "We'd just try hard to get back."

Founder of Tulsa-based Matrix relishes sense of peace and balance he draws from
his music

BYLINE: Kirby Lee Davis

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 582  words


Steve Alter may pay his bills with his architecture, but he frees his mind with
his music.

While he draws pleasure from the creativity both arts foster, the founder of the
Tulsa architectural, engineering and planning firm Matrix relishes the sense of
peace and balance he draws from his trumpet, guitar and piano - especially when
he's playing alongside others.

"It's an instant gratification when you're sounding good and your group's
tight," said Alter with a warm, satisfied smile that speaks of cherished
experience.

For in his lifelong passion for music, Alter developed more than a career.

Even before graduating from high school, Alter found himself tapping his
instrumental and vocal talents in gig after gig with The Rising Suns, a '60s
Coffeyville, Kan., band his friends patterned after Chicago, Blood Sweat and
Tears, and Tower of Power.

It fulfilled a childhood dream for a young lad who grew up listening to his
father play trumpet with big bands across the Sunflower State. But since taking
up the horn requires a developed musculature and bone structure, Alter started
formal training in second grade not with his father's instrument of choice, but
with the ivory keys.

Alter didn't mind.

"I had a crush on my piano teacher," he admitted with a wolfish grin. "She
looked like Liz Taylor. "

In fifth grade he began private lessons with the brass, but his dad wasn't his
only musical inspiration. An uncle who played custom guitars got Steve to pick
up an axe in junior high, fueled also by the rock-and-roll inspiration pouring
out of KOMA, Oklahoma City's AM powerhouse reportedly heard as far away as
Vietnam.

With friends equally motivated, Alter ran with The Rising Suns from 1965 to '73.

Their group developed a regional following and a reputation of showmanship
earned through heavy touring. It led to potential breakout performances on The
Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and The Joey Bishop Show, but in each case the
talk shows ran long, cutting out the band's appearance.

"You get your breaks," he said with a shrug, "and you go from there. "

Eventually that's what he did, gaining an architectural degree from Kansas State
University on his way to launching Matrix in 1984. But he never put his music
aside, gathering over the years a collection of six trumpets, 12 mouthpieces, 16
guitars and 10 amps.

"I hate to even add it up," he said of his investment. "Probably over 50 grand.
"

Still, all that paid off when The Rising Suns decided three years ago to get
back together. As they started playing a handful of gigs per year, leading up to
this year's induction into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame, the writer and
producer in Alter was more than ready.

Perhaps even closer to his heart has been his role in guiding the Oklahoma Jazz
Hall of Fame. A director since 2001, Alter is chairman of the board this year -
which puts him in the envious position of seeing the hall spread its wings
through its new Santa Fe Depot home.

As an architect, that Vision 2025 renovation project thrills him. As a musician,
the work promises a new and exciting place to play. But as a jazz hall director,
Alter said it fulfills him.

"Manhattan Construction will be out of here by the middle of June," he said.

After a month of debugging, Alter expects the jazz hall to offer its first
concert in mid-July, starting a series of regular gigs he expects will help that
uniquely American art form flourish anew.

"That's what it's all about," he said. "Educating the public. Wait until you see
this place. "

D.J. Cat: So Who Needs Blue Blood?

ANDREW BEYER

SECTION: SPORTS; PAGE G8; ANDREW BEYER

LENGTH: 672 words


As the undefeated colt D.J. Cat has gained prominence as one of the country's
best 3-year-olds, even breeding experts who look at his pedigree have been
mystified.

Who is his little-known sire, Hurontario?

Who is his dam, Woo Wee?

And, the real puzzler: Why is former WBA heavyweight champion Michael Dokes, who
has never been involved in horse racing, listed as the colt's breeder?

D.J. Cat has such a cheap pedigree that most people wouldn't have bothered to
breed him at all. By the time an owner buys a mare, pays for a stud fee and then
pays for the upkeep of mother and foal, it's almost impossible to recoup the
investment by either selling or racing the offspring. This is why the whole
breeding industry is in the doldrums. There is no sound economic reason for
breeding a cheap horse. The only rationale is the long-shot hope that the foal
will defy all genetic probabilities and become a high-class horse.

Happy Alter, the owner and trainer of D.J. Cat, always has been an exuberant
optimist. He came to the Kentucky Derby a few years ago with a 55-1 shot, No
More Flowers, and regularly recited verse, a la Muhammad Ali, predicting
victory: "If the others want to jive, we'll take them in five. If the others
want to mix, we'll take them after six" -- six furlongs, that is.

Alter is, in fact, a friend of Ali and such a boxing aficionado that his racing
silks display two boxing gloves. Ali introduced Alter to Dokes a few years ago,
and Dokes would sometimes visit Alter's barn in the morning to watch him train.
Alter suggested that they buy a horse in partnership, and he claimed Woo Wee for
the two of them. But Dokes never got any action for his investment. Woo Wee
turned out to have a chip in a knee and was retired to a farm in Ocala, Fla.

Alter uncannily decided to breed Woo Wee to Hurontario, an obscure stallion who
had been a minor stakes winner in Canada. (He was bound for even more obscurity;
he spent last year standing at stud in Karlsruhe, N.D.) But Alter perceived some
merits in this match: "The sire could run all day. I liked his conformation and
how it would blend with her conformation."

In her first two years at Bonnie Heath Farm, however, Woo Wee wasn't able to
conceive. In the next two seasons, she produced foals by Hurontario. And the
bills were piling up. Alter was paying his half share, but farm manager Kim
Heath said: "We couldn't collect from Mr. Dokes." The fighter might well have
been distracted. During this period, he was arrested once for breaking six of
his girlfriend's ribs, and another time for cocaine possession.

When the unpaid bills reached $ 30,000, the farm took legal action and held a
sheriff's sale to dispose of the mare and her offspring. The farm wound up
keeping Woo Wee -- and shortly thereafter sold her for $ 500 to a breeder of
quarter-horses. Alter got the yearling son of Hurontario-Woo Wee, whom he named
after the family pet.

This would hardly have been a memorable transaction if D.J. Cat had turned out
to be the modest claiming horse his pedigree seemed to dictate he would be. But
when Alter put him into training with his other youngsters, he saw that D.J. Cat
had freakish ability.

The colt has confirmed Alter's judgment, winning his only two starts as a
2-year-old, and then scoring two spectacular victories at 3, most recently a
sensational win in the Swale Stakes at Gulfstream Park. Not surprisingly, Alter
is getting excited and starting to think about the Kentucky Derby. But he can't
suppress a feeling of regret that those unpaid bills at the farm caused him to
lose Woo Wee, whose value as a broodmare is now much enhanced.

That's not the only injustice in the improbable success of D.J. Cat. Florida
pays awards to the breeders of winning horses, and the breeder is defined as the
owner of the mare at the time she was bred. Said Heath: "Michael Dokes and Happy
Alter are on the registration papers as half-owners of Woo Wee. That means that
Dokes will be collecting breeder awards. And he never paid one bill."

Familiar foes to clash in girls regional playoffs;
Carroll, Tippecanoe and Alter are again among contenders.;
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: ; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 452 words


Carroll's Amanda Schroeder drives the baseline as Alter's Olivia Gillis defends.
They could face off again in Friday's regional final.

What do Carroll, Versailles, Jackson Center, Tri-Village and Minster high
schools have in common? They all have their girls and boys basketball teams
still playing in the postseason. Here's five things to know about that and this
week's girls basketball regional tournaments.

1. The girls D-II regional semifinals are today at Springfield High School. No
surprise in this field, which features Carroll (22-4) vs. Independence (19-6) at
6:15 p.m. and Alter (24-2) vs. Tippecanoe (23-3) at 8 p.m. Carroll, Alter and
Tipp are regulars this deep into the playoffs. The winners return at 7:30 p.m.
for Friday's regional final.

A two-time defending D-II state champ, Alter has a firm grip on this portion of
the Sweet 16. The Knights feature the 1-2, go-to punch of seniors Libby Bazelak
(Duquesne University signee) and Braxtin Miller (Oklahoma State) and a
formidable supporting cast. Alter beat Carroll twice in the regular season,
including a 32-31 squeaker. Carroll beat Tipp.

The D-II regional final is Friday.

2. This is the debut season of Carroll coach Cecilia Grosselin. A veteran
assistant, she succeeded Rob Berry, who died from complications from cancer last
summer. It also is Tippecanoe's first season in the Greater Western Ohio
Conference after jumping with Stebbins from the Central Buckeye Conference. Red
Devils girls coach Andy Holderman has been a stabilizing fixture after Tipp
replaced both its boys and girls basketball coaches in midseason two years ago.

3. This has been an unprecedented basketball season at Versailles, and that's
saying a lot considering the Tigers' boys and girls program histories. The
Versailles girls (23-3) are up first, playing Badin (19-7) in a D-III regional
semi at Springfield on Wednesday.

4. The Tri-Village girls (24-1) have lost only at Versailles in the regular
season. The Patriots and All-Ohio candidate senior Allie Downing are paired
against Jackson Center (21-4) in a D-IV regional semi at 6:15 p.m. Thursday at
Vandalia-Butler. JC was a state final four team last season. The other semi is
Russia (21-5) vs. Minster (23-2) at 8 p.m.

Minster defeated Midwest Athletic League rival Versailles, and Shelby County
League rivals Jackson Center and Russia during the regular season.

5. The Division I, III and IV regional finals are Saturday. D-I at Fairmont is
the only division that won't include an area team. All the regional winners
advance to next week's state final fours at Ohio State University's
Schottenstein Center in Columbus.

After August crash course, Alter's Thuney becomes 2-way lineman;
Knight coaches take advantage of natural ability of lineman on both sides of
ball.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 370 words


KETTERING - Joe Thuney was going through his regular practice in "The Pit," the
area for offensive linemen, when Alter High School defensive coaches approached
him.

The Knights were less than a week from beginning their football season against
Fairmont and coming off a much-to-be-desired scrimmage against Vandalia Butler.
The defense was a concern for the two-time defending Division IV state champion
Knights, and they turned to one of their biggest and best players.

"They took me aside, taught me all the reads and just told me to do what came
naturally," said Thuney, a 6-foot-5, 235-pound senior.

So Thuney quickly became a two-way player with less than a day's worth of
practice at defensive end.

"Actually about 20 minutes," Thuney said.

Already one of Alter's key players, Thuney has taken to his expanded role and
will factor heavily when Alter travels to face Centerville on Friday, Sept. 10,
in the Dayton Daily News Game of the Week, one of the area's most anticipated
matchups in years. Both Centerville (Division I) and Alter are 2-0 and No. 1 in
their divisions in the DDN area ratings.

With scholarship offers from Vanderbilt, Michigan State, Buffalo and Youngstown
State, Thuney had already proven himself on the offensive line. Then, because of
his athleticism and experience, coaches felt comfortable with his crash course
at defensive end.

"He's like a 4.2 student, so you don't have to tell him too many times," Alter
coach Ed Domsitz said.

Thuney is part of a well-known Alter athletic family that includes father Mike,
uncle Mark, who played football at Notre Dame, and aunt Marcia, who earned 11
varsity letters with the Knights. Thuney also has a strong connection to
Centerville, as his mother was a skilled Elks tennis player, and the family
lives about a mile from Centerville High School.

With that athletic background, Thuney was quick to pick up his new position.

"They just drilled into me, 'Don't let anyone outside you,' " Thuney said. "It
was a pretty simple philosophy; I just had to stay disciplined enough to make it
work."

Plus, he gets to tackle people.

"I had three the first game," Thuney said. "I was pretty proud of that."

CUSTODY ABORT SHOCK Judge OKs 'outrageous' query

BYLINE: BY DAREH GREGORIAN NEW YORK DAILY NEWS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 508 words


A HOLY WAR broke out in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday over a judge's decision
to allow testimony about a woman's abortion to be used against her in an ugly
custody case.

Lisa Mehos' lawyer, Emily Jane Goodman, told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice
Lori Sattler her decision to allow the evidence about her client's procedure -
which happened after her split from banking big John Mehos - "scandalous and
outrageous."

"This might go over well in Texas or Mississippi, but not here," Goodman said.

The explosive topic was first raised last week by John's lawyer, Eleanor Alter,
who discovered it after subpoenaing Lisa's medical records. She used it in an
apparent attempt to paint Lisa as a hypocrite for having asked to have custody
of their two young kids over Easter weekend in 2012.

"(At) the time that she told him that he couldn't have the children for Easter
because he was an atheist, she was having an abortion," Alter said, a court
transcript shows.

Alter said she should also be allowed to question Lisa about the procedure
because "this is a woman who complains that she's under great stress only caused
by Mr. Mehos. I would be the first person to acknowledge that having an
abortion, especially a two- to three-month late abortion, would be stressful,"
Alter said.

She said she also also wanted to know whether the kids "were exposed to this
man, how it all came about."

"If this man was coming in the house, if she's out of the house to see him, if
it was date rape, that's relevant," Alter said.

Goodman urged the judge not to force her client to testify about the procedure.

"I think the very idea of the potential of using against a woman in a custody
case the fact that she may have had an abortion sets women's rights and the
rights of choice back in a way that I can't imagine this court would want to be
associated," Goodman said.

The judge sided with Alter, noting that Lisa had previously testified she had
never had any men over her to New York apartment.

"I do find it to be relevant. The children were in her care at the time,"
Sattler said.

Lisa, 38, then testified that the pregnancy was the result of a one-time fling
with a longtime friend at his place. She said she had arranged for her mother to
stay with the kids, then ages 2 and 4, while she had the abortion, and that she
stayed in a hotel for a night afterwards to recuperate.

She told The News she felt "violated" about having to talk in court about
something that's so personal.

When she returned to court to continue her testimony Tuesday, there were over a
half-dozen women's rights activists there, some wearing "I had an abortion"
T-shirts. Also there was former Playboy model Bridget Marks, who was involved in
a notorious custody case herself a decade ago. She said what Lisa Mehos was
going through was "revolting."

Lisa wasn't the only one to be embarrassed in court - she testified that her
husband, who heads a bank in Texas, had tearfully confessed her to one night
that he had cheated on her dozens of times with prostitutes.

The Mehoses were married for six years.

NO SHOES KEEP D.J. CAT A WINNER

BYLINE: JOHN CRITTENDEN

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 646 words

DATELINE: MIAMI


After vanishing for nine months, D.J. Cat, South Florida's mystery horse,

came back barefoot.

"But not shoeless," said his trainer, Happy Alter.

"He had no shoes on his front feet," said Alter, as if this carried

great importance.

Unbeaten, untied and unshod, D.J. Cat became the talk of Florida racing on
Christmas Eve, the winner by 10 lengths at Calder in his first race since the
Swale Stakes at Gulfstream March 14.

"If he ran with shoes, I figured no one would show up to run against

him," said Alter, waiting for the laugh.

Edward Alter was less than a year old when his mother nicknamed him

"Happy." The baby always seemed to be having such a good time, she said.

But even in his cradle, Happy Alter never babbled and cooed with more

enthusiasm than he did after D.J. Cat was unwrapped once more Dec. 24.

Alter, 48, is not always Mr. Giggles. He responds to questions with stern,
cryptic, carefully worded replies. He is especially enigmatic (complete with

long pauses) following inquiries involving the unorthodox training procedures
that are his trademark.

But the comeback of the celebrity of his stable seemed to leave him giddy about
D.J. Cat's prospects for winter racing at Gulfstream.

Few horses at Calder, or anywhere else, run shoeless. The aluminum

horseshoe protects and maintains the thoroughbred's feet, most trainers agree.
"Horses run on the prairies without shoes," contended Alter. "Horses

are born without shoes."

Are bare feet more likely to be injured?

"There was a strike of blacksmiths in New York, and horses ran without

shoes. Running on the track is one thing-- if the horse ran across volcanic

rock, that would be completely different."

Is Alter trying to bankrupt Calder's blacksmiths?

"There is no savings. The blacksmith still shapes the feet. And 90

percent of the horses I train wear four shoes." There was a pause. "I use

shoes on 99 percent of my horses, but once in awhile . . . "

Alter is secretive about details concerning the 25 horses he trains. But

he concedes D.J. Cat, undefeated in five races, winner of two stakes, has gone
through foot problems.

Shoes are simply an option, he proposed.

"Adopting to situations and finding a solution, that's what training

is," Alter said. "Shoes are part of a horse's equipment. Working with

veterinarians and blacksmiths and suggesting my own ideas, the horse was more
comfortable training without the shoes."

The Cat, clearly, has many lives.

"The only undefeated 3-year-old stakes winner in the country," Alter

said.

But D.J. Cat ran far less than most 3-year-old stakes horses. Technology, the
leading 3-year-old moneywinner in Florida, raced 11 times in 1992. Pistols and
Roses was in nine races. D.J. Cat raced twice.

"Jolie's Halo (Alter's prize pupil of 1991) left an emptiness now that I

am not training him," he said. "But with people all over the country talking

about D.J. Cat, some of that emptiness has been filled."

Are people all over the country really talking about a colt who won an

allowance race after being away for nine months? Alter's timing was masterful.
The Cat was on the front page of the industry newspaper, The Daily Racing

Form, partly, perhaps, because there is little news during the Christmas lull.
When he was a young colt, Jolie's Halo refused to try to run away from

other horses in races, Alter said. Changes in his training supplied a remedy for
that, he said. Alter added that the horse's jockey was amazed by the

alteration in the running pattern of Jolie's Halo.

"I wasn't amazed," Alter said. "The jockey asked me what I had done.

"I didn't tell him. There are things a trainer does not tell. There are

things that make a difference."

Now that the Cat is on the prowl once more, when will he run again? July 4
perhaps? Labor Day? Alter pointed to two Gulfstream races in January. One race
is on grass, the other on dirt. As usual, not everything is revealed.

But Happy is happy, that's no secret.

Casting Call: top technologists!;
IS job opportunities are at the forefront of Southern Californias economic
recovery

BYLINE: Leslie Goff; Goff is a freelance writer in New York

SECTION: COMPUTER CAREERS; Regional Scope: Southern California; Pg. 84

LENGTH: 714 words


Driven by a surge of small technology-oriented companies, Southern California's
economy has begun to stabilize and recover from the recession of the early
1990s. Overall economic growth is slow, but information systems professionals
can be more optimistic about the employment market than people in many fields.

"We have a broad-based economic rebound going on in Southern California," says
Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation of Los
Angeles County. "The major sectors driving it are all major users of
technology."

But finding the right IS professionals to fill the bill has been a struggle for
Alan Alters, director of information technology/West Coast at Turner
Broadcasting Worldwide Information Technology Services in Los Angeles. Alters
oversees a staff of 20, which he plans to increase by 20% to 25% this year.

"I have openings, and I'm just not finding the types of qualified candidates I'm
looking for," Alters says. "We're getting into client/server applications
support. We really need some high-performance talent. But I just don't see the
level of skill I've been accustomed to."

A major labor migration out of the region, following massive layoffs and company
closings during the recession, has contributed to that gap.

Alters says several of his top-rate colleagues traded IS jobs for other careers
just to stay in the area. Population growth in Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico
has been largely attributed to Californians moving east for new jobs, lower
housing costs and other quality-of-life issues.

"That was precipitated by what was going on in the local economy," Kyser says.
"But aggressive economic development efforts here are helping new
technology-oriented industries grow."

Los Angeles County

Los Angeles would be the ninth-largest state in the country if it weren't a
city. But Kyser says, "We're more of an Inc. 500 town than a Fortune 500 town."
Inc.'s list is based not on sales volume and revenue but on growth ratios, "and
we have a lot of small, quickly growing companies," he says.

And Los Angeles needs them. Kyser estimates that among the three counties, 74%
of the jobs that were lost to the recession were in Los Angeles County. Today,
the county is regrouping. International trade, management consulting,
professional services and new entertainment-industry concerns all are on the
rise in Los Angeles. And the old standbys tourism, television and motion picture
production continue to provide an economic anchor for the area.

Orange County

The New York Times reported on Dec. 5 that Orange County, which declared
bankruptcy in late 1994, "is stumbling through a fiscal recovery." The article
said the county "has settled into a comfort zone that many ... say is part
denial, part business as usual and part pushing the costs of the crisis" onto
the poor.

The county's comfort zone features a diverse mix of companies and falling
unemployment rates, but Kyser notes that Orange County traditionally has had the
highest employment rates of the three counties.

San Diego County

Public-sector jobs dominate in San Diego, but "if you're in San Diego and you're
not in the public sector, you're probably working at a high-tech company doing
software development," says Max Schetter, director of economic research at the
Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce.

Of the five largest private-sector companies in the area, three are in the
health care field: Scripps Institution of Medicine and Science, Sharp HealthCare
Corp. and Kaiser Permanente Health Plan, Inc. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and
defense contractor Science Application International Corp. round out the list.
Schetter says, however, that smaller, entrepreneurial firms are driving
thearea's recovery.

After rapid growth in the 1980s, San Diego County fell hard under the pressures
of the recession, losing thousands of jobs in defense and aerospace. But new
jobs are emerging in four categories: nondefense high-technology, including
software development, telecommunications and biotechnology; tourism;
international trade; and professional services. "In general the outlook is good
for IS folks," Schetter says. "There's good demand for highly skilled workers,
but without top skills, it's a very competitive market."

Inspection to halt flow through Bluestone Dam

HINTON - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to temporarily halt water
flowing through the Bluestone Dam on Wednesday.

The corps says halting the water flow will allow crews to conduct a periodic
inspection of the dam's sluice gates.

A fish survey downstream from the dam also is planned while the water flow is
halted.

Crews will begin closing the gates early Wednesday morning. After the inspection
is completed, crews will slowly open the gates to return the New River to a
normal flow.

January spill boosts St. Albans' tax revenue

St. Albans got a tax revenue boost from the January chemical spill as thousands
of people came to the city to buy groceries and eat in restaurants.

St. Albans wasn't affected by a water ban imposed after the Jan. 9 spill in
Charleston.

The Charleston Daily Mail reports that St. Albans's business and occupation tax
revenue increased by $30,000 in the third quarter of 2014, compared to the same
January-to-March period in 2013.

Mayor Dick Callaway says the increase is at least partially due to the spill.

The city also sold water to commercial entities at a cost of 1 cent per gallon,
and provided free water to residents from other areas.

State schools celebrate homegrown foods use

Schools across West Virginia are celebrating their cafeterias' use of locally
grown fruits and vegetables.

The West Virginia Department of Education says schools spent more than $1
million to buy local foods during the past two years.

October is National Farm to School Month. The department is asking schools to
showcase their county's Farm to School projects Oct. 13 through Oct. 17.

W.Va. switching to LED highway lights

The West Virginia Division of Highways is making after-dark travel on highways a
little brighter.

The DOH is switching to highway lights with LED bulbs. The project is beginning
in Kanawha, Putnam, Mason, and Cabell counties. Making the change statewide is
expected to take two to three years.

DOH spokeswoman Carrie Bly tells WSAZ-TV that the old lights were yellow and
dull and had a limited coverage range.

The project will cost about $2 million. The state says the new lights will save
money because they are more energy efficient and will last longer.

Martinsburg police capture escaped suspect

MARTINSBURG - A Virginia suspect who escaped while being taken to a jail in
Pennsylvania has been captured in West Virginia.

The Martinsburg Police Department says officers took Jeffrey William Moore, 30,
into custody without incident Sunday evening at a residence. Police went to the
residence after receiving an anonymous tip.

The Herald-Mail reports that the police department announced Moore's capture
Sunday night.

Moore is wanted on an outstanding warrant from Virginia. Police in Waynesboro,
Pa., took Martin into custody last week after officers encountered him in
Memorial Park.

Martinsburg police say Moore escaped from a transport vehicle while being taken
to the Franklin County Jail in Pennsylvania.

Moore is being held in the Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg.

C-J shakes of nerves, holds of rival Alter;
Derrick Brown's 12 second-half points key to Eagles' win

BYLINE: By Debbie Juniewicz For the Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C6

LENGTH: 373 words


DAYTON - The Eagles had more to contend with than the Knights Sunday as the
Chaminade-Julienne boys basketball team also had to shake off a case of the
nerves.

"I've been at C-J for 20 years and, in that time, we must have played Alter at
least 45 times and there haven't been many easy wins," Eagles coach Joe Staley
said. "It's a big game for us, and we were a little bit nervous early."

The Eagles handled the Knights and their nerves as C-J edged Alter 53-47 at the
University of Dayton Arena to improve to 3-3 for the season.

Alter took the early advantage, lighting up the scoreboard first as the Knights
led 4-0 but a flurry of Alter fouls sent the Eagles to the line and C-J quickly
closed the gap. Donovan Potter capped an 8-point C-J run with a threepoint
basket as the Eagles took an 8-4 lead.

Knights center Andy Dorow, however, was just getting warmed up as the Alter
senior poured in 15 first-half points. The contest was knotted at 23 at the
half.

"He came out ready to play," Staley said of Dorow. "He's real capable of that
and we knew we needed to play him better."

While Dorow almost doubled his season scoring average in the first half alone,
C-J standout Derrick Brown was held to only six first-half points. The Eagles
6-foot-8 senior averages 19.2 points per game.

"He got a lot hungrier in the second half," Staley said of Brown. "For us to
win, he knew he had to get it done in the paint."

Brown did just that as he doubled his first-half production with 12 second-half
points. His success was contagious as the Eagles were 11 of 15 from the floor in
the second half.

"Brown got loose for some points and we knew he would," Alter coach Joe
Petrocelli said.

It wasn't the Knights' defensive effort, however, that disappointed Petrocelli.
Alter was 15 of 31 from the free throw line for the game, hitting only 3 of 11
down the stretch in the fourth quarter.

"We were on the line a lot and if you make those, you win the game," Petrocelli
said. "When they give you free ones, you've got to make them."

Neither team will dwell on this game for long as the Eagles are next in action
Tuesday at Roger Bacon while the Knights, now 2-4, hit the road this morning for
the Carson High School Invitational in Nevada. Alter won the eight-

Alter High School senior Kraig Howe will follow new University of Wisconsin head
football coach Paul Chryst to Madison.

A 6-foot-3, 259-pound defensive tackle, Howe originally had verbally committed
to Pittsburgh, where Chryst was the head coach from 2012-14. After Chryst was
named to succeed Gary Andersen as head coach of the Badgers, Howe decommitted to
Pitt.

Howe verbally committed to Wisconsin during an official visit to the Madison
campus this past weekend.

"I bought into their philosophy and who they wanted on the team, the type of
character," he said on Monday after basketball practice. "They wanted the
combination of a student-athlete. When the opportunity opened for me at
Wisconsin, it was too much for me to pass up."

Howe said the Badgers' staff envisions him playing defensive end in their 3-4
scheme. "It's a great spot for me," he said.

Howe teamed with Alter senior Dean Lemon to anchor the Knights' defensive line.
Alter (14-1) lost 21-14 to Cleveland Benedictine in the Division IV state
championship.

Howe was first team All-Ohio and was the co-defensive player of the year with
Benedictine's Jerome Baker, who committed to Ohio State. Howe also had offers
from Minnesota, Illinois and Northwestern of the Big Ten.

Other Alter grads to play at Wisconsin were linebacker Chris Borland (49ers) and
receiver Connor Cummins. Alter senior Nick Coleman is committed to Notre Dame,
where he'll likely play corner. Another senior, kicker Alex Craft, is hoping to
be accepted by the U.S. Air Force Academy. Lemon remains uncommitted.

Remaining at Pitt are brothers Nicholas Grigsby and Bam Bradley
(Trot-wood-Madison), Adam Bertke (Marion Local) and Carson Baker (Fairborn).
Area players at Wisconsin are Josh Harrison (Wayne) and A.J. Jordan (Trot-wood).

National signing day for football is Feb. 4.

David King of Israel

BYLINE: Morton I. Teicher

SECTION: BOOKS

LENGTH: 723 words


King David by Steven L. Mckenzie. New York, Oxford University Press. 272 Pages.
$25

The David Story by Robert Alter. New York, W.W.Norton. 410 Pages. $30 or £19.95

The Heart of an Executive by Richard D. Phillips. New York, Doubleday. 271
Pages. $21

The story of David, the simple shepherd boy who courageously slew Goliath and
rose to become an illustrious king of Israel, despite his human failings, is one
of the greatest sagas in the Bible. Here are three books that tell about David
from different angles, presenting contrary views and making it useful to read
all three books to get a fully rounded view.

Steven L. Mckenzie, an associate professor of Hebrew Bible at Rhodes College in
Memphis, emphasizes the negative aspects of David's character and minimizes his
achievements.

Richard D. Phillips, chief executive officer of The Alliance of Confessing
Evangelicals, presents David as an ideal executive who has much to teach today's
business leaders.

The full Biblical narrative is presented in an erudite and incandescent
translation by Robert Alter, professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at
the University of California, Berkeley. Of the three, Alter's superior
scholarship makes his book the least polemical and the most valuable.

McKenzie begins by identifying the sparse contributions of archaeology to the
story of David, and he then describes the sections of the Bible that deal with
David. Seven chapters follow narrating David's life story and the book concludes
with a summary synopsis. Throughout, McKenzie stridently depicts David as a
"Middle Eastern tyrant" who was "senile and flaccid" in his dying days. Early in
his life, according to McKenzie, David was a ruthlessÉmercenary" who tried to
"usurp" King Saul's throne. McKenzie claims that his portrait of David, as
brazen adulterer, a shrewd power-hungry politician, a grim assassin, and a
wanton murderer is a "realistic likeness."

By contrast, Phillips, an evangelizing Christian with degrees in business and in
divinity, hails David as a "leader and executiveÉIsrael's greatest king and hero
of the Bible's Old Testament." He reviews David's biography in admiring terms,
drawing lessons for the behavior of modern business executives.

His complimentary comments portray David as a true leader with "credibilityÉ
perseveranceÉ resourcefulness." However, Phillips does not limit himself to
admiring David as a model executive; he also uses the story of David as an
argument for faith in God.

Readers can best make their own judgments about David by reading the Bible
itself rather than McKenzie's or Phillip's edited and slanted versions.

Fortunately, Alter's excellent book translates and offers insightful comments on
1 and 2 Samuel and the first two chapters of 1 Kings where David's life is
recounted.

In his 35-page "to the Reader," Alter places the story of David in the context
of the Bible and the social context of the time. An extensive commentary runs
along the main text in footnotes on the page, and, as Alter puts it, "is
conceived as handmaiden to the translation. It is the work of an unrepentant
literary critic, but its principal aim is to serve the story."

Here, for example, is Alter's translation of the first meeting between the
prophet Samuel and David: "And he was ruddy, with fine eyes and goodly to look
on. And the Lord said, 'Arise, anoint him, for this is the one.'" Alter
comments: "David's good looks will play a crucial role in the magnetic effect he
is to have on women and men. But he is not big, like his brother Eliab, and
Samuel has no opportunity to make a judgement on appearance, for David is
brought from the flock sight unseen, and then God immediately informs Samuel,
'this is the one.'"

The literary excellence of Alter's presentation provides a portrait of David
that is neither so vindictive as McKenzie's nor so fawning as Phillips's. What
emerges is a realistic portrait of an eminent man with many human frailties. He
began as a handsome, musical, brave shepherd who developed into what Alter
calls, "the first Machiavellian prince in Western literature."

While Alter's superlative portrait stands out in its radiance and
full-bloodedness, reading it alongside the books by McKenzie and Phillips helps
to provide a well- rounded image of a complex and intricate Biblical character
whose story sometimes defies comprehension.

Alter's fans face tipoff conflict;
Boys, girls both scheduled to play on Thursday night.;

Alter's Dominic Laravie shoots over Carroll's Jared Kieninger during Alter's
47-42 district final win, which sent the Knights into the Division II regional
semifinal against Aiken on Thursday.

The Alter High School boys Division II regional semifinal basketball game
against Aiken on Thursday has been pushed back 30 minutes to an 8:30 p.m. start
at Fairmont's Trent Arena.

That tipoff became an issue after Alter defeated Carroll 47-42 in Sunday's D-II
district final at UD Arena. Already scheduled to play Thursday in the girls D-II
state basketball semifinal at Columbus was Alter's girls team. The defending
D-II state champs will play Columbus Eastmoor Academy at the Schottenstein
Center at 6 p.m. Thursday.

OHSAA director of information services Tim Stried said all state tourney games
are locked in their time slots. That's due to "so many moving parts" to putting
on such a grand four-game production each day. The sites and start times of
sectional, district and regional games can be adjusted.

"Unfortunately, this happens in baseball and softball, too," Stried said. "We
wish we could wave the magic wand and have it fixed, but we just can't. It's
really unfortunate. We hate to be in the position where communities might have
split crowds but sometimes we just cannot avoid it."

Realistically, that isn't enough time for Alter fans to attend both games, but
the extra time helps.

? Dunbar (53 points) and Stivers (28) placed 1-2 in the boys combined Divisions
II-III Ohio Association of Track and Cross Country Coaches indoor state track
championship last weekend at the University of Akron. Centerville placed second
among the D-I boys and girls.

The Dunbar boys swept the 4x200-meter (1:30.28) and 4x400 (3:29.52) relays.
Stivers senior Tyler Johnson accounted for most of the Tigers' points by posting
meet records in the 60 (6.78) and 400 (48.22) and was second in the 200. Placing
second in the 400 was Meadowdale's Wayne Lawrence (48.56).

Also winning in the D-II/ III meet was Twin Valley South shot putter Aaron
Deaton (53-11.25), Dunbar's girls 4x400 relay (4:08.09) and Chloe Flora of
Botkins, who set a 1,600 record (5:00.99).

Lainey Studebaker won the 800 (2:14.18) and was second in the 1,600 to lead the
Centerville girls. Teammates Isis Trotman also was the weight throw (56-11) by
nearly 10 feet. Ilyaas Motley was a triple jump winner (44-11.50) for the Elks
boys.

Gahanna Lincoln (56.5) won the girls D-I meet, followed by Centerville (51).
Pickerington Central (54) was first and Centerville

(44) second among D-I boys.

? Veteran Minster boys hoop coach Mike Lee has resigned his coaching position.
He's the winningest head coach in program history, compiling 314 wins in 23
seasons. That includes a final four in 2005, six district and 12 sectional
titles. He'll remain in his current position as the high school principal.
Minster was 13-10 this season.

Lee is the third Midwestern Athletic Conference boys hoop coach to resign. Scott
McEldowney resigned at Versailles last week after a 26-year run with the Tigers,
including the last 10 as head coach. Rick Hickman also resigned at Parkway.

? Three area coaches will receive special recognition by the Ohio High School
Basketball Coaches Association during Saturday's girls high school basketball
championships at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus. Tom Benjamin
(Springfield) and Carla Siegel (Fort Loramie) both will receive a wrist watch
for earning 400 career wins. Dennis McIntosh (West Liberty-Salem) will get a
ring for 300 career wins.

? Southeastern was incorrectly identified as needing to fill an open head
football coaching position in last Thursday's story about Fairborn hiring Chris
Roark as its new head football coach. Greg Bonifay remains the head coach at
Southeastern.

Alter president sign of restructuring;
Kettering high school changing hierarchy to give more control at local level

BYLINE: By Helen Bebbington For the Dayton Daily News

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-1

LENGTH: 505 words


KETTERING - As the first president of Alter High School, the Rev. James Manning
will focus on community relations and eventually, development for the school.

"I'm trying to get myself out there," said Manning, who is also pastor at St.
Albert the Great Parish in Kettering.

The announcement that Manning will serve as president is another step in the
change in the management structure at Alter High School.

Manning

was asked to serve as president by the school's board of trustees.

The board itself is a new entity, and has been in place for about a year. Daniel
Pilarczyk, archbishop of the Diocese of Cincinnati then approved the request for
Manning to be appointed as president.

Although presidents have been a mainstay at many schools run by religious
orders, Alter is the first high school owned and operated by the Diocese of
Cincinnati to have a president.

"The majority of the Catholic high schools in the archdiocese that are operated
by somebody else, usually religious orders, do have a structure where they have
both a president and a principal," said Dan Andriacco, director of
communications for the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

"There are others (schools) that have considered it and rejected it, and others
who are still considering it." Alter's board of trustees has started committees
to focus on facilities, finance, development and academics, said Kirsten
MacDougal, director of marketing and communications for Alter High School.

Before the board and president position were established, "it was all on the
principal's plate," Mac-Dougal said.

Now, Alter Principal Sister Katie Hoelscher can focus on running the school,
while the board and president focus on the external operations.

The principal now reports to the president, and the president to the board. The
archbishop must ultimately approve the board of trustee's ideas, plans and
proposed changes.

"The diocese is giving more control to the local level," Manning said. It is
"delegating authority in certain areas to the board."

A native of Beavercreek, Manning graduated from Carroll High School. He was
ordained in 1975.

He has master's degrees in philosophy and theology, and a master's degree in
education from Xavier University.

Manning was associate pastor from 1988-91 at St. Henry in Dayton. In 1991, he
became pastor at St. Albert.

Manning said Alter will probably be hiring a development company. The company
will take surveys among the Alter parents, students and others connected to the
school.

From there, a plan will be formulated to deal with fundraising, if the survey
indicates a capital campaign is needed sometime in the future, Manning said.

Manning said Alter is likely to use a Louisiana consulting firm, called
Institute of School and Parish Development, which did a similar parish analysis
at St. Albert.

The company planned the capital drive plan for the church when it was trying to
raise $4 million.

ISPD would compile a report to find out where the school is now, where the Alter
community wants to go and how it should get there, Manning said.

Giuliani Draws Criticsm From a Running Mate

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

SECTION: Section 1; Page 26; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 667 words


Susan D. Alter, the Republican-Liberal candidate for Public Advocate, yesterday
faulted her ticketmate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, for failing to take forceful enough
positions on women's issues.

Ms. Alter made the remark in her first debate with Mark Green in the general
election campaign. She said she would keep Mr. Giuliani's "feet to the fire" on
women's issues if they are both elected. She said she had "not seen a strong
platform" on women's rights from Mr. Giuliani.

Mr. Green said he also found gaps in some of the policies of his running mate,
Mayor David N. Dinkins. But Ms. Alter's criticism came in a week in which Mr.
Giuliani gave two speeches on women's rights, trying to build support among
women amid polls that show Mr. Dinkins is leading among female voters.

Place on the Ticket

Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, responded to Ms. Alter's
remarks by saying that her inclusion on the Republican-Liberal ticket
demonstrates a commitment to women. "We are the only campaign with a woman
running for citywide office," Ms. Lategano said. "We are proud of Susan and look
forward to working with her."

The debate, taped yesterday for broadcast Sunday between 8 and 9 P.M. on WCBS
Radio, also followed polls that show Ms. Alter trailing Mr. Green, who is
running on the Democratic ticket with Mayor Dinkins, even among Republican
voters.

Ms. Alter repeatedly described herself during the debate as an advocate of
women. She said she would urge Mr. Giuliani to order greater city scrutiny of
abortion clinics, some of which she described as "butcher shops."

'Old Boys' Network'

Mr. Green is the first Democratic candidate to engage in a head-to-head debate
in the general election campaign. Mr. Dinkins and Alan G. Hevesi have insisted
on including minor-party candidates, and because of that position have not
participated in any debates.

Neither of the candidates for public advocate seized the radio debate to
criticize the proposals of the mayoral candidates they oppose.

Mr. Green said he would monitor the performance of beat police officers in Mayor
Dinkins's "Safe Streets, Safe Cities" program.

Both candidates described their credentials as better suited to the newly
created office. And both criticized the other as being too closely tied to the
top of the ticket.

Ms. Alter said Mr. Green, who was Commissioner of Consumer Affairs under Mayor
Dinkins, "has become part of the old boys' network" of the Dinkins
administration. Mr. Green charged that Ms. Alter, a Democratic member of the
City Council for 16 years, was "the hand-picked puppet" of Mr. Giuliani.

Mr. Green said he "lauded the community policing policy" of Mr. Dinkins, who has
hired more officers and ordered more of them assigned to neighborhood patrols.
But Mr. Green said he "would like to see an audit of the beat cops" to determine
such things as how much time they are spending on patrol and whether they fail
to respond to citizen phone calls.

Yesterday, Herman Badillo, the Republican-Liberal candidate for comptroller,
also distanced himself from one of Mr. Giuliani's positions by saying that he
would consider making cuts in the Police Department to close an anticipated $500
million shortfall in the city's budget.

Mr. Giuliani has called for cutting 35,000 city workers by attrition, but he has
said he would try to exempt several agencies from any cuts, including the
police, fire and parks departments.

In a taping of WCBS-TV's Sunday Edition, to be televised Sunday morning, Mr.
Badillo said he would not exempt any agency from layoffs.

The Marist Institute for Public Opinion released a new poll showing that Mr.
Hevesi is leading Mr. Badillo by 15 points, 45 percent to 30 percent. The poll
had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.

A New York Post-Fox 5 poll published Wednesday gave Alan G. Hevesi an
eight-point lead over Herman Badillo in the New York City comptroller's race.
The margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Alter tops Bellefontaine for district title

LENGTH: 262 words


Alter ended a three-year drought without a boys district high school basketball
championship Wednesday night with a 55-44 win over Bellefontaine at UD Arena.

The victory in a Division II district final moves the Knights to the regional
semifinals March 15 at Wright State vs. the Columbus Beechcroft/Canal Winchester
winner. Those teams play Friday in a district final in Columbus.

Alter (20-2) has been in a district championship game 25 of the 43 years Joe
Petrocelli has been head coach. His teams have won 23 of those championship
games. Their last occasion to cut down the nets came in 2003 when they got to
the state title game losing LeBron James and Akron St.Vincent-St.Mary.

Since that runner-up year, they have been in the sections.

On Wednesday, Alter took command early, jumping out to a 16-4 lead. Ryan Siggins
keyed the early explosion with eight of his 17 points. From there, Alter stayed
in control with a tough defense and good shot selection.

Bellefontaine (17-6) was able to make a fourth-quarter run, getting within 45-41
with 3: 45 left. But Alter ran the clock, drew fouls and was steady at the line
slowly extending the lead.

Siggins led Alter with 17 points, while J.J. Laumann added 14 and Paris Harris
11.

LENGTH: 538 words


Penn State's Megan Courtney had 11 kills in the NCAA title game win over BYU.

Miamisburg freshman Mackenzie Frantz will compete in the Queen of Diamonds
Showcase.

Alter High School graduate Megan Courtney was a big hit in last weekend's NCAA
women's volleyball championships.

A junior at Penn State, the 6-foot-2 outside hitter was named the tournament's
most outstanding player. It was the second straight NCAA title for the Nittany
Lions, who defeated Stanford in the semifinals and Brigham Young in the finals
at Oklahoma City.

Courtney had 23 kills against Stanford and 11 kills and 14 digs in the title
game, a 25-21, 26-24, 25-14 defeat of BYU. Penn State (36-3) won its sixth NCAA
title in eight years and its seventh overall, which snapped a tie with Stanford
for the most championships.

Courtney was a member of three Alter teams that advanced to the state final
four. As a senior in 2011 Alter lost to Columbus Hartley in four sets.

? Piqua snapped Trot-wood-Madison's 25-game GWOC North boys basketball win
streak with an 86-79 victory Saturday night. Colton Bachman scored 11 of his 24
points in the fourth quarter to lead the Indians (4-1).

Piqua had lost the previous 18 contests against Trotwood, dating back to 1998.

? Oakwood unloaded the ultimate shutdown defense on visiting Eaton in Friday's
boys hoop game. The Lumberjacks led 26-0 at the end of the first quarter. Eaton
hit a free throw with 4:58 left in the first half to close within 34-1.

Oakwood (3-1) reportedly ran out the clock in the fourth quarter. Michael Hoecht
led the Lumberjacks with 34 points. Eaton is 2-5.

? Division I football state finalists Wayne and Lakewood St. Edward will be
featured on Time Warner Cable's "Road to Victory" series. The first airing is at
7 and 8 p.m. on Christmas Day. It also will air at 5, 9 and 11 p.m. on Saturday
and at 6:30 and 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.

The RTV-produced show can be seen on TWC Channels 311 /1311. St. Edward defeated
Wayne 31-21 in the title game at Ohio Stadium in Columbus earlier this month.

? Fairmont senior field hockey standout Olivia Davis has been selected to the
2014 Harrow Sports/ National Field Hockey Coaches Association (NFHCA) High
School All-Region Team, representing the Midwest Region.

Davis was team MVP as a junior and senior. She had 18 goals and 10 assists last
season. She also was first team All-Southwest Ohio Field Hockey League and first
team on the Ohio Field Hockey Coaches Association All-Ohio Team. Davis has
signed to play at the University of Virginia.

? Miamisburg freshman Mackenzie Frantz has been chosen to participate in the
Queen of Diamonds Showcase North at Kent State on Jan. 3-4. A third baseman and
pitcher, she played for the Ohio Hawks 14U team last summer. The annual event
draws fast pitch softball players from 21 states and Canada.

? Jessie Crowell of Covington scored 40 points to set a Buccaneers girls hoop
single-game scoring record during last week's 75-23 defeat of Cross County
Conference rival Franklin Monroe. The previous record had stood for 24 years.

? Troy Cantrell, a 6-foot-5 senior at Ponitz, has signed to play basketball at
Fairmont State (W.Va.).

Judge clears Alter cash use

BYLINE: by Jamie Mason

LENGTH: 386 words


Jewish newspaper publisher Alter Communications Inc. has received final approval
to use its cash collateral.

Judge James F. Schneider of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Maryland in Baltimore on Friday, May 14, signed a final order allowing use of
the funds, court papers said.

Alter sought to tap the funds so that the Baltimore debtor could continue its
operations while it reorganizes in bankruptcy.

It owes Wachovia Bank NA $641,460 in prepetition secured debt.

The company filed for Chapter 11 on April 14 due to contentious litigation with
former printerH.G. Roebuck & Son Inc.The litigation was causing cash flow issues
for the publisher, court papers said.

Alter Communications had a 10-year printing contract with H.G. Roebuck with
rates that were significantly in excess of market value once the downturn in the
economy hit. Alter asked H.G. Roebuck to readjust the pricing on the contract
and defaulted on it after H.G. Roebuck refused.

The printer sued Alter in February 2009 in Maryland state court for defaulting
on the contract. A judge in that case recently made a ruling resulting in a
$326,125 judgment against Alter Communications. Alter filed for bankruptcy
because it did not have the money to pay the judgment.

Alter Communications traces its roots to 1919, when David Alter started
publishing the Baltimore Jewish Times, a weekly newspaper that now has more than
50,000 readers.

According to court documents, the Baltimore Jewish Times is regarded as the
"Newsweek of Jewish journalism."

Alter Communications began a second publication, Style magazine, in 1989. Style
covers home design, fashion, food and regional travel, has 90,000 readers and is
published seven times a year.

In 2001, the debtor expanded its business further through the acquisition of
Chesapeake Life magazine. Chesapeake Life is published four times a year and
focuses on the Chesapeake region, from regional travel to places to eat.
Chesapeake Life has about 57,000 readers, court papers said.

In addition, Alter Communications in 2002 started Alter Custom Media, a
publishing division that provides publication, production, editing, Web design
and other services.

Alter Communications has 45 employees.

Alan M. Grochal and Maria Ellena Chavez-Ruark of Tydings & Rosenberg LLP are
debtor counsel.

Alter inducted to Hall of Fame

BYLINE: BY MARK GARCIA, THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER

SECTION: LAGUNABEACH; Pg. Sports

LENGTH: 324 words


Laguna Beach's Hobie Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame
recently at an invitation-only ceremony at the San Diego Yacht Club.

Alter was one of 15 inductees to the inaugural class.

Alter is widely remembered as the man behind the development of the
foam-and-fiberglass surfboard. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling
surfboard brands of all time.

He is also the creator of the Hobie Cat, the Hobie 33 ultralight-displacement
sailboat and one of the finest mass-produced radio-controlled gliders, the Hobie
Hawk.

Alter opened up Southern California's first surf shop in Dana Point in the
1950s. Then in 1958, he and his buddy Gordon "Grubby" Clark (as in Clark Foam)
began experiments making surfboards out of foam and fiberglass.

"After years of planning, we are so pleased that the heroes of our sport are
getting their long-overdue recognition," said Dick Franyo, president of the
National Sailing Hall of Fame, in a press release.

"The National Sailing Center and Hall of Fame will be a place to honor these
heroes and provide inspiration for all sailors - young and old."

The inductees are U.S. citizens 45 and older who have made a significant impact
on the growth and development of the sport in the United States, in categories
of Sailing, Technical and Contributor.

Nominations of non-citizens were also considered if they influenced the sport,
and posthumous nominations were also accepted.

Alter - who is also an inductee to the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame - is one of
five inductees from California.

The others include four-time America's Cup winning skipper Dennis Conner (San
Diego); 1968 Star Olympic Gold Medalist and founder of North Sails Lowell North
(San Diego); 1998 Whitbread Round the World Race winning skipper Paul Cayard
(Kentfield) and singlehanded circumnavigator and noted writer Joshua Slocum (San
Francisco).

Shareholders sued as alter ego of bankrupt company

BYLINE: Pat Murphy

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 251  words


A judgment creditor had standing to sue shareholders as the alter ego of a
bankrupt corporation, the 9th Circuit has ruled in reversing a dismissal.

The defendants are the sole shareholders of a nut company. The plaintiff
obtained an arbitration award against the company in a breach of contract
dispute over a shipment of almonds.

After the nut company filed for bankruptcy, the plaintiff sued the defendants as
the company's alter ego in an effort to collect the arbitration award.

The defendants argued that creditors of a corporation in bankruptcy lack
standing to assert a claim against the corporation's sole shareholders on an
alter ego theory. According to the defendants, such a claim belongs solely to
the bankruptcy trustee.

But the court concluded that, under applicable California law, the bankruptcy
trustee in this case could not bring an alter ego claim to pierce the corporate
veil, leaving such a claim available to the company's creditors.

"[W]e conclude that California law does not recognize an alter ego claim or
cause of action that will allow a corporation and its shareholders to be treated
as alter egos for purposes of all the corporation's debts. Just because [the
bankruptcy] trustee could not bring such a claim against the [defendants] under
California law, there is no reason why [the plaintiff's] claims against the [the
defendants] cannot proceed," the court said.

Incarnation, Alter grad gives back to hometown

BYLINE: HERE ABOUTS SANDRA BAER

SECTION: CENTERVILLE AND WASHINGTON TWP; Pg. RH-2

LENGTH: 451 words


Cynthia Duckro Jecker, 31, of Centerville can't seem to get too far from home.

The former Incarnation Elementary School student and 1994 Alter High school
graduate left the area for five years while she studied elementary education at
the University of Kentucky in Lexington, and taught second grade for one year in
Lexington, but then love brought her right back to Centerville.

"I was born in Kettering, but after my mother passed away and my father
remarried, we moved to Centerville," said Jecker, whose father is Charlie Duckro
of Bellbrook.

"I met my husband, Steve, in the fourth grade at Incarnation when he moved here
with his parents, Al and Darlene Jecker. We were also together in Dr. Cheryl
Reichel's fifth- and sixth-grade classes. Now, she's the principal of
Incarnation and I'm assistant principal."

Jecker continued her high school education at Alter, while Steve Jecker attended
Centerville High School.

"I was really into dance," said Jecker, who studied at Wendy's School of Dance
and was a member of the Alter High School Lancerette Dance Team.

"I taught dance during high school and college, but I also worked in the library
at UK. One of the librarians was showing us a new search engine on the computer
and asked us if we wanted to look anybody up. Steve and his family had moved to
Johnstown, Pa., during high school and he was attending Penn State, so I decided
to look him up on the computer."

The beginning of a fairytale romance started with the click of a button. Jecker
contacted Steve Jecker and the two began corresponding over the Internet.

Coincidentally, Steve's parents made another move to Louisville, Ky., giving
their son a reason to meet Jecker face-to-face again.

"He graduated with a degree in marketing and took a job with the Berry Co. in
Dayton," said Jecker, who has a 3-yearold daughter, Madelyn.

"I accepted a job teaching second grade at Incarnation and moved back." The
romance was heating up when Steve Jecker appeared with a book at Jecker's class
under the pretense of reading a fairy tale to the students.

His self-authored book, "Cynthiarella," resulted in a hit with the students and
their teacher after Jecker received a marriage proposal.

While working on a master's degree in educational leadership and a principal
licensure, Cynthia Jecker moved into the administrative position at Incarnation.

She and her father are longtime volunteers at the Incarnation Parish Fish Fry,
which has taken place for more than 25 years. This year's fish fry will be 5
p.m. to midnight Friday, March 14.

For more information about the event, call (937) 433-1188, ext. 206.

Last year, Jecker was chairwoman of the Silent Auction that included donated
themed baskets for purchase.

Knights teach hockey to players with disabilities;
Partnership has created a unique learning experience for the team.;
Focus on your home team Alter Knights

The Alter Knights hockey team has shared its time and talent the past two
seasons with the Special Hockey Columbus Blue Jackets, a Columbus Chill Youth
Hockey Association team composed of young people with physical and developmental
disabilities. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO

For the Alter Knights, hockey is about more than wins and losses, shots and
saves. It's about sharing their time and talent.

For the past two seasons, the Knights have worked with the Special Hockey
Columbus Blue Jackets, a Columbus Chill Youth Hockey Association team composed
of young people with physical and developmental disabilities.

Special hockey got its start in the United States in 1996 in St. Louis.

There are now more than 50 American Special Hockey Association programs in 30
cities enabling athletes with disabilities to learn and compete in a safe and
supportive environment.

"It's very inspiring to see them playing," Alter junior forward Austin Collins
said of the special hockey players.

"Skating is second nature to us, but they have to really work at it, and you can
see how much they want it. They really look forward to it."

That enthusiasm is contagious. The Knights' second trip to volunteer in Columbus
this year was scheduled after their hockey season was finished, so the coaches
made it optional because many of the players had already started playing a
spring sport.

Not a single Alter player missed the trip.

"They all really enjoy working with the kids, and they get so much out of it,"
Knights team manager Art Collins said. "It's very worthwhile for our kids and
their kids."

Making a difference

Kettering mom Karen Solarek has seen the impact the program has had on her son
Tom, a sophomore defenseman for the Knights.

"It has really helped him to appreciate all that he has," Solarek said. "And it
shows him how to give back. From a parent's perspective, it's an awesome
program."

Alter hockey has long strived to incorporate a philanthropic component into its
program, even though it must also raise money for its own team's expenses.

"We have fundraisers every year because hockey is not a cheap sport," Art
Collins said. "But we also think it's important to share what we have, so we put
aside a portion of our funds to help others."

That money has helped offset ice costs for the Blue Jackets team. But the
Knights make more than monetary donations. They face off against the special
hockey squad in games and scrimmages and also have hosted a clinic.

"It's cool to teach hockey because you don't get a lot of opportunities to do
that," Austin Collins said. "And helping them also enables me to work on my
skills and see areas where I can improve."

Building relationships

A shared love of hockey has been the foundation for player relationships that
grow stronger every season. Some of the Knights have cheered on the Blue Jackets
at games the past few seasons. Likewise, some Blue Jackets players were in the
stands when the Knights played in the state tournament.

"It really has turned into a neat relationship," Solarek said.

Alter 2nd at state again, by just 3 points;

COLUMBUS - Been there, done that. Again.

"We all tried our best, and that's the best you can do," said Alter junior
Hilary Esselstein after the Knights girls cross country team placed second for
the third straight year in the Division II state championship Saturday at Scioto
Downs.

"It's very disappointing. But, you know, the closer it is, the harder it is."

And none of those runners-up hit Alter harder than this. Just three points
separated the Knights and defending champ Salem, 70-73. Esselstein was eighth
overall (18:55) to pace Alter. Joining her were Ally Stover (27th), Emily
Zimmerman (28th), Lauren Bockrath (30th) and Mary Untener (40th). All ran
personal records or near bests and most have run this race all three years.

Alter's losing margins have been six, 13 and three points. "That's
unbelievable," coach Matt Sableski said.

"In girls cross country you don't see longevity, typically. Most teams peak and
then crack. The fact that we've had this core of girls run this well for three
years in a row is a testament to them. We return four of our top five. We'll be
back."

It was the first time the teams raced each other since last year. Both kept pace
with each other by Internet postings and results, and knew a showdown was
inevitable.

"Everyone counts," said Salem coach Mary Wilson. "When you get that close, three
points is like, major."

Junior Emily Infeld of Cleveland Beaumont won the race in 17:40. Greenon junior
Jordan Stafford, out most of the season with injury, was 10th (19:06), and
Oakwood sophomore Julia Sizek 15th (19:10). Carroll's team finished fifth.

Division III: Gates Mills Gilmour Academy cranked over the final 400 meters to
snap Minster's two-year team title run, 83-89. Every Academy runner improved her
position in that span, none more so than senior Kelsi Nutter, who jumped a dozen
spots over the last mile.

"Minster is the gold standard of cross country in Ohio," Gilmour coach Matt
Lindley said. "They're the program that sets the standard. But at the same time,
I told the girls all week we were coming down here to run for first place."

Sophomore Bernadette Burke led Minster, placing seventh (19:03). The Tigers's
entire top five ran sub-20:00.

"I knew we were tough, but I knew there were other teams that were very tough,
also," Minster coach Jessica Magoto said. "Our girls didn't run terrible, but we
just needed a little more of a spark."

Anna senior Sarah Schulze (18:34) needed about 20 more meters.

Undone by injuries the last two years, she went from sixth to second in the
final minute, and made up 100 meters on winner Caitlin Thomas of
Cardington-Lincoln (18:32).

"Too bad it was only 3.1 miles or I might have been able to come out with it,"
Schulze said. "I gave it a good effort, and that's all that really matters. I'll
be able to look myself in the mirror when I get home."

Division I: Northmont freshman Hannah Turlington posted a 13-second PR (18:12)
to place fifth, capping an outstanding debut season and joining the '07 state
front-runners.

"It's awesome," Turlington said. "It was just exciting to get here."

Lakota West senior Amanda Burger won (17:36), and Cincinnati St. Ursula beat
Bowling Green 116-128 for the team title. Beavercreek took ninth.

Alter awaits surging Carlisle in second round;
Busy preps week includes local teams in football, soccer and volleyball.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 490 words


The Carlisle High School football coaches gave the same message to their players
throughout the opening week of the playoffs.

"We told our boys they can make history," said Carlisle coach Bill Jewell on
Sunday, Nov. 8. "No one can take away being the first to win a playoff game in
school history."

The Indians did just that. A No. 6 seed in Division IV, Region 16, Carlisle
(9-2) topped previously undefeated North College Hill 21-13 on Saturday for the
first postseason victory in the program's history.

Getting a second will be another challenge. In the second round, Carlisle will
face defending state champion Alter at 7 p.m. Saturday at Monroe High School.

Alter (11-0) advanced by beating Jonathan Alder 42-0 on Saturday for the
program's 26th consecutive win on the field (the Knights forfeited their first
two wins last season). The Knights, ranked No. 1 in the state, rebounded after
two first-quarter turnovers inside the Alder 30-yard line, a fumbled pitch and
interception by junior quarterback Zane Pitzer.

"You have to have a short memory as a quarterback, otherwise those things will
haunt you," Pitzer said after the game.

Pitzer responded with two rushing touchdowns and a throwing score following the
turnovers as Alter steamrolled into the second round. As Jewell celebrating
Carlisle's win, he considered the prospect of facing Alter.

"Anybody can win on any given day," he said. "They just don't hand people
titles."

Boys soccer

A potential state final rematch looms for Beavercreek.

Last season, the Beavers lost the title game to Cleveland St. Ignatius. This
season, as Beavercreek (15-2-4) is scheduled to face Gahanna Lincoln (20-0-1) in
the 7 p.m. Tuesday state semifinal at Cedarville University, Cleveland St.
Ignatius (21-0) will play Strongsville (17-1-3) in the other semifinal.

The D-I final will be played at 7 p.m. Friday at Columbus Crew Stadium.

Girls soccer

Centerville has been to the state final four times under coach Don Skelton, but
the Elks haven't won a title.

They're hoping this week will be different as the Elks (20-1-1) enter a 7 p.m.
Wednesday D-I state semifinal against Dublin Coffman (13-5-3) at Hilliard
Bradley High School.

The two teams playing in the other semifinal, No. 3 Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit
(18-0-2) and No. 4 Medina (19-1-2), both finished in the Top 4 in the final
state rankings.

The D-I final will be played at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Columbus Crew Stadium.

Volleyball

The Nutter Center will again play host to the state volleyball tournament from
Thursday through Saturday.

Two area teams will participate. On Thursday, Marion Local (26-0) will face
Bascom Hopewell-Loudon (26-1) in a D-IV semifinal at 6 p.m. The winner will play
in the state final at 1 p.m. Saturday.

Fenwick (22-4) will play Huron (24-3) in a D-III semifinal at 2 p.m. Friday. The
winner will play in the state final at 3 p.m. Saturday.

State volleyball tickets are $9 at the gate or $7 presale at participating
schools.

FOES MOUNT REPEAL EFFORT ON 'CONFERENCE OF STATES' RESOLUTION

BYLINE: Fred W. Lindecke Missouri Political Correspondent

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 342 words


The Legislature adopted a resolution in February to allow Missouri to
participate in a "Conference of the States." Now an attempt is being made to
repeal the resolution before the Legislature adjourns because opponents contend
that the conference is a disguised effort to call a U.S. constitutional
convention.

Rep. Bill Alter, R-High Ridge, introduced the repeal resolution last week with
14 co-sponsors. He has until the legislature's adjournment on May 12 to pass it.

Alter said the original resolution "slipped by us with virtually no debate.
There are serious concerns about this being an end run around the Constitution
to set up a constitutional convention. The Bill of Rights would be changed, and
it scares me," said Alter.

Dag Ryen, spokesman for the Council of State Governments in Lexington, Ky., said
the resolution is misunderstood. "The conference is being called because we
don't want a constitutional convention. It's only set up to produce a petition
to Congress."

The states in the conference would consider a constitutional convention only if
Congress did not respond, Ryen said.

The Conference of the States is aimed at restoring more balance of power between
the states and the federal government. It would be based on the 10th Amendment,
which gives to the states and the people all powers not given specifically to
the federal government or denied to the states.

Ryen said 14 states have passed the resolution, with 26 needed to call the
conference that is scheduled for Oct. 22-25 in Philadelphia. As with other
states, Missouri would send as delegates representatives of the governor and the
Legislature.

The John Birch Society, the National Education Association, the Eagle Forum and
the AFL-CIO are among organizations that have opposed the conference.

Don Griffin of the St. Louis John Birch Society said the precedent for turning
the Conference of the States into a constitutional convention was set in 1787,
when only seven of the original 13 states convened the first constitutional
convention.

Waterloo, Iowa, company puts $5 million high-tech shredder to work

BYLINE: Pat Kinney, Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, Iowa

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 486 words


Mar. 26--WATERLOO -- Alter Trading Corp. is tearing up -- or shredding up -- the
local metals recycling business.

That is thanks to a new high-tech, $5 million shredder which, along with
conveyors occupies several acres of its 30-plus acre Waterloo salvage yard on
Airline Highway.

"We can do 100 tons of material an hour. That would be about 90 (junk) cars,"
said Steve Pleis, general manager of Alter's Waterloo operations.

The shredder has roughly double the capacity of its predecessor, a 30-year-old
unit. It was state-of-the-art in its time, but required extensive maintenance
and was well past its prime.

The larger capacity and new technology allows "quicker handling of materials."

Installation of the shredder began in August, and it was operational in
December. Peters Construction Co. of Waterloo was the general contractor.
Independent engineer Jose Martinez of Miami, who specializes in such projects,
was construction coordinator.

The shredder extracts ferrous metals for delivery to customers such as mills,
with rail cars on site. Nonferrous metals are taken to a company facility in
Davenport. The remaining material, or "fluff," is used for landfill cover.

About 23 people work at Alter's Waterloo yard, and company officials plan to
hire a couple more. Several workers who had spent most of their time maintaining
the old shredder can now be devoted to production work.

The shredder project represents a major reinvestment in the locally founded
former Weissman Industries operation by its current owners, said Pleis, who
began working with Weissman in 1977.

Alter has owned the operation about five years and retained many Weissman
workers, several of whom have 40-plus years of service.

Weissman opened the Airline Highway yard in 1990.

While Alter Trading is based in St. Louis, its current owners have Iowa roots
and are making a major investment in another Waterloo facility now under
construction. Alter's board chairman is Quad-Cities businessman Bernard
Goldstein. He also heads up Isle of Capri Casinos Inc., the company building
Waterloo's new casino near Lost Island Adventurepark.

When the shredder project was announced in April, Robert Goldstein indicated it
was hardly a gamble.

"This expansion reflects Alter's continuing commitment to significantly invest
in its operations, in its employees and in the communities in which we operate,"
Goldstein said.

Alter has several such operations in the Midwest, including seven in Iowa. It
also has an office in China dealing with materials it exports to businesses
there.

Christian Montague scored 18 points for Chaminade Julienne in an overtime loss
to Wesley Christian, Ky., on the fourth day of the Flyin' to the Hoop at Trent
Arena.

Alter played its third game in four days and rallied in the fourth quarter to
edge Middletown 48-44 in the Day 4 finale of the Premier Health Flyin' to the
Hoop at Trent Arena.

Dominic Laravie had 21 points to lead the Knights (10-2), who beat Fenwick on
Friday and lost to unbeaten and top-ranked Moeller (Division I) on Saturday.

"It's my fault," Alter coach Eric Coulter said. "In the original schedule we
also had Urbana (on Tuesday), at Urbana. We got that changed. Getting the
opportunity to play in Flyin' to the Hoop, we're going to take that every time."

Robby Ruffolo added 10 points for Alter. Clifton Snow led the Middies (4-7) with
13 points.

Versailles 61, Tri-Village 56: Ohio State commit Justin Ahrens had 26 points and
nine rebounds to lead the Tigers in a high-end matchup between the Midwest
Athletic Conference (Tigers) and Cross County Conference (Patriots). Keaton
McEldowney added 13 points for Versailles (12-1).

Seniors Trace Couch (24 points) and Gavin Richards

(19) led the Patriots (6-5), who are at full strength following multiple player
four-game suspensions for hazing.

Prolific Prep (Napa, Calif.)100,Trotwood-Madison 83:Gary Trent Jr. (Duke signee)
scored 33 points and the house-favorite Rams couldn't overcome first-half foul
trouble and suffered their first loss. Abu Kigab (Oregon) added 24 points for
Prolific.

Torrey Patton had four 3-pointers and a game-high 36 points for Trotwood (10-1),
which vaulted to No. 1 in the state Division II rankings on Monday. Myles Belyeu
added 19 points and nine rebounds.

Wheeler (Marietta, Ga.) 77, Princeton 48: Darweshi Hunter scored 12 in leading
the Wildcats in a rare Flyin' blowout. That completed a two-game Flyin' sweep
for the Georgia power, which also defeated Pickerington Central 64-51 on
Saturday.

E.J. Montgomery led Princeton with 18 points. Darius Bazley, a 6-7 junior who's
also verbally committed to OSU, had 11 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for
the Vikings (6-6). It was his first action since transferring from Finneytown.

Cin. Roger Bacon 74, Bethel 54: Alec Pfriem hit 12 of 14 combined shots and free

Pa. Finance Company Buys Del. Bank

                           January 26, 1982, Tuesday

Special to the American Banker

DATELINE: WILLOW GROVE, Pa.


Teachers Service Organization, a consumer finance company specializing in loans
to teachers that is headquartered in this Philadelphia suburb, said it acquired
control of Colonial National Bank of Wilmingon, Del., for $1,985,605.

The bank, with deposits of $9 million, has three offices in Wilmington.

Teachers Service Organization, or TSO, bought 50.2% of the Colonial stock from a
trustee of Corpamerica Inc. and Middlesex Trading Co. It purchased 5% more from
bank officers and directors, as well as members of their families. TSO intends
to buy the rest of the stock, except for the directors' qualifying shares.

The finance company, which is privately held, specializes in loans to teachers
in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and four other states. It has $80 million
in outstandings.

Dennis Alter, president of TSO, became chairman and chief executive of the bank.
Abele Minutella, who was chairman and president, continues as president.

Mr. Alter said TSO plans to switch most of its consumer lending operations to
the bank.

TSO bought the bank in order to expand into electronic funds transfers, he
explained. Colonial plans to issue one of the two major bank cards and is
considering hookups with either the MAC or George automated teller systems, Mr.
Alter said.

The finance company, he added, has no plans to raise interest rates on loans in
Pennsylvania that will be made via the bank, even though Delaware has no usury
ceilings and Pennsylvania limits rates to 18%-22%, depending on the size and
terms of the loan.

Mr. Alter said TSO plans a capital contribution to the bank.

SLASHING ATTACK IN MIDTOWN
ETHNIC SLURS & A RAZOR

BYLINE: By MIKE CLAFFEY

SECTION: News; Pg.  8

LENGTH: 304 words


An Orthodox Jew was slashed across the face in an apparent bias attack in the
Diamond District after confronting six teenagers who shouted ethnic slurs at
him, police said yesterday.

Five youths were arrested moments after the slashing of Abraham Alter, who was
wearing a yarmulke and driving a convertible with two friends on W. 47th St.
east of Seventh Ave. about 11:30 p.m. Thursday.

A sixth suspect, a 15-year-old girl who allegedly was the one who slashed Alter
with a razor blade, was arrested in the Bronx.

The suspects were charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon, said
John Yi, a police spokesman.

Alter, 42, an attorney who lives in Edison, N.J., was treated at St. Vincent's
Medical Center, where doctors closed a 5-inch gash on the left side of his face
and a cut on his palm.

"I'm in a lot of pain," Alter said. "I've got a gash from my temple to my lip.
They cut the main artery in my face, and they couldn't stop the bleeding for a
long time."

Alter said several people rushed to help him:

"One lady got me some ice," he said, "another person got me a towel and others
were just rooting for me."

Alter said he had just finished dinner with two friends and was stopped at a red
light with the top down on his Chrysler Sebring when the teens started hurling
ethnic epithets apparently after spotting their yarmulkes.

"I turned and said to them, 'What do you want from the Jews?' " Alter said.
"Then they started walking toward us, and I got out of the car, because I didn't
want to just sit there."

The suspects are Jennifer Morales, 15, address unavailable; Hector Rosario, 17,
of 422 E. 143d St.; Naomi Delgado, 18, and Peter Delgado, 17, of 400 Brook Ave.;
Maria Ubiera, 16, of 435 E. 142d St., and Frank Ovalle, 16, of 700 E. 141st St.,
all in the Bronx.

All Alter, all the time.

The Knights ramped up their postseason success in three sports Saturday to
highlight a busy day for area high school tourney teams.

* Alter's girls' cross country team snapped a frustrating three-year run by
winning the state Division II title at Scioto Downs in Columbus. Alter was
second the previous three seasons by a combined 22 points.

* Alter's boys' soccer team is going to state for the second straight year. The
Knights (17-2-2) earned that passage by eliminating Columbus Watterson 2-0 in a
D-II regional final at Fairborn.

* Finally, Alter put a 33-0 hurt on Oakwood in the first round of the D-IV

Temple gets $15 million gift to build hall;
An alumnus and his wife want the new Alter Hall to help anchor the Fox School of
Business.

Dennis Alter, chief executive officer of credit-card-issuer Advanta Corp., and
his wife, Gisela, are giving $15 million to Temple University toward
construction of Alter Hall, a 200,000-square-foot building that will help anchor
the university's Fox School of Business.

Architect Michael Graves, known for designing everyday objects such as toaster
ovens for Target, will help design the building.

The gift is the second largest in Temple's history. The amount of the largest
has not been disclosed, but it came from the late James E. Beasley of Villanova,
for whom the university's law school was named.

Alter Hall will replace Temple's Curtis Hall and will be built next to Speakman
Hall, the current headquarters for Fox. Together, they will allow the business
school to consolidate from nine buildings to two.

Construction of the proposed $78 million, seven-story Alter Hall is to begin in
early 2006. It is part of $400 million in construction and renovations under way
at Temple.

The gift has particular resonance, Dennis Alter said, because he taught high
school English for three years in Philadelphia and is the child of two teachers.

Alter, who had Elton John perform at his 60th birthday party in 2002, spent nine
years at Temple during the 1960s, getting his bachelor's degree and taking
master's courses. He went from being a "terrible student," he said, to being an
A student and varsity tennis player.

"The life lessons I learned from various professors and coaches had a
transformational effect on my life," he said yesterday.

After teaching for three years, Alter joined his father's company, then called
Teachers' Service Organization. That company eventually changed its name to
Advanta, and Alter ultimately became chairman and CEO.

The Alters - collectors of abstract expressionist art - are among the pledged
financial backers for the proposed Barnes Foundation gallery in Center City, if
the courts approve the art collection's move out of Merion.

Dennis Alter is also vice chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The couple
are major donors to the Opera Company of Philadelphia, Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, and Arthur Ashe Youth Tennis and Education.

, contenders for D-II golf title

BYLINE: By Greg Billing Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 400 words


Maintaining the gentlemanly tradition of the game, the high school golf rivalry
between Alter and Oakwood is one of mutual respect.

But when it comes to competing at the state golf tournament, it's winner take
all.

"I got a call from Ryan Stump the other day, who was our No. 1 last year,"
Oakwood senior Corey Weckerling said of his former teammate. "He said just go to
state and beat Alter. That was definitely motivating."

Oakwood won the Division II state title in 2009 by seven strokes over runner-up
Alter. The Lumberjacks go for the repeat, with Alter one of its top challengers,
in the D-II state tournament today and Saturday at Ohio State University's
Scarlet course (par 71, 7,043 yards).

Hunting Valley University School and Columbus St. Francis DeSales - which
finished third and fourth in 2009 - also return.

"It's just a school rivalry," said Weckerling, who sometimes golfs and hangs out
with Alter players. "Yeah, we want to do better than them. But if they beat us,
good for them. I know how hard they've all worked and how hard we've worked.
It's pretty even."

Weckerling and Alter sophomore Alec Tahy could be Dayton's best shot at an
individual title. Both are long hitters, and that suits the Scarlet course.

"I think Alec Tahy (has a chance)," Alter coach John Sherman said. "Being only a
sophomore I like to call him Big Baby. He hasn't even finished growing. He's
really hitting the golf ball well. ... The one good thing is the Scarlet course
is the great equalizer. No matter what the weather, we like our chances there."

Oakwood returns two golfers from last year's state title with senior Adam Bogdan
(fifth overall) and Weckerling (13th). The desire to repeat is there, but with
three new team members - two sophomores and a freshman - the pressure is less
than in 2009.

Alter, led by Tahy and his seventh-place finish at state in 2009, receives
senior leadership from Jon Neroni (13th in 2009, tied with Weckerling) and Mike
Gearhardt.

"In order to defend it you have to get there," said Oakwood coach Jen Lohmeyer,
who made a return trip to Columbus goal No. 1 for the Lumberjacks. "The feeling
when you walk into that facility, there's nothing like going there. I don't want
to say it overwhelms you, but it's such a great experience for the boys and
anybody who gets to play on that golf course."

   Alter Moneta was launched in 1998 in Longueuil, Quebec, by Alain Savard,
formerly chief financial officer of Bombardier Capital. Savard started his new
company with a strong entrepreneurial instinct and a distinct vision of a
nimble, people-centric organization. His primary objective was to create an
enterprise that would one day become a leading provider of financing solutions
in the North American mid-market commercial equipment finance market. Over time,
Alter Moneta has gained distinct expertise in providing superior customer
service on both sides of the Canadian/United States border through seamless
service to companies with business in both nations.  The initial capital to
establish Alter Moneta was provided by National Bank of Canada (NBC) and Caisse
de dÃ©pÃ´t et placement du QuÃ©bec (Caisse), the largest institutional fund
manager in Canada and one of Quebec's leading financial institutions. In 2003,
Alter Moneta purchased Concord Commercial, the equipment finance subsidiary of
HSBC Bank USA, establishing a U.S. headquarters in Buffalo, New York, and
gaining 43 U.S.-based employees. In 2007, Bear Stearns Merchant Banking (BSMB),
a leading private equity firm, acquired a controlling interest in the company.
Today, Alter Moneta has an equipment finance portfolio of over $US 1 billion.

Alter needs more room in the trophy case

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 256 words


Win or lose in the Division IV state football championship game on Friday, Nov.
28, Alter has a growing problem: No space in the trophy cases.

"There's no room in it for the last one we won in March, to be honest," said
Alter High School Athletics Director Chris Hart, whose girls basketball team
claimed the Division II crown this past spring. "I don't know what the plans are
to alleviate that problem.

"We're not going to retire trophies. We're having a capital campaign for the
school and new trophy cases would be needed." The Knights have added a lot of
hardware this decade, a bunch from the state level. From 2001 to present, Alter
sports teams have won seven state championships and 10 state runners-up. That's
17 state-level trophies from eight sports in eight years. The 2006 state
football runner-up trophy and football are jammed in against the glass. Those
came after a 34-33 loss to Steubenville, Alter's opponent this Friday. "That was
one that was tough to swallow, being so close," Hart said. "That hurt for a long
time."

Alter principal retiring with years of memories

BYLINE: By Joanne Clodfelter Contributing Writer

SECTION: GREENE COUNTY; Pg. Z4-7

LENGTH: 368 words


KETTERING - Sister Katie Hoelscher will be retiring from Alter High School on
June 30, after more than 30 years of high school teaching and administrative
work in the Dayton area.

"I never planned to be an administrator," said Hoelscher, 68, the school's
principal. "There's a special thing about teaching. I loved the interaction with
the kids. As a principal, you have a completely different relationship with the
kids. As an administrator, you affect more people in a different way."

When Hoelscher entered the convent in the 1950s, she was pleased that her order,
the Sisters of Charity, asked her to be a math teacher, since she had always
loved math.

After teaching math at high schools in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Marion, she
came to Alter High School in 1972. After teaching at Alter for one year, she was
asked to be principal at St. Joseph's Commercial High School for girls, which
was located in downtown Dayton.

Hoelscher returned to Alter in 1974, and stayed until 1986, where she taught
math and was principal from 1981 to '86. She taught at Carroll High School from
1986 to '88. She then held leadership positions for the Sisters of Charity in
Dayton and in Cincinnati for 11 years.

While she said she enjoyed working with the Sisters of Charity, she missed
teaching. In 2000, she went to work in Alter's alumni office. In 2005, she
accepted the position of interim principal.

"I will miss the kids and the relationships with faculty and parents," Hoelscher
said. "One of the greatest blessings has been teaching the kids of the parents I
taught."

Alter is currently creating a long-range strategic plan to meet its challenges
of maintaining enrollment and remaining competitive with other schools in the
south Dayton suburbs.

"I still think Catholic education is viable," Hoelscher said. "I realize many
parents have to make huge sacrifices. I dream for the day every Catholic student
can get a Catholic education."

She said one of the biggest advantages of a Catholic school is the faith
formation. "We educate the whole person," she said. She will be taking a year
off to explore her options and said she has no immediate

plans to leave the area.

Hundreds paddle out to honor Hobie Alter

BYLINE: BY LAYLAN CONNELLY, Staff Writer

SECTION: DESERT; Pg. A

LENGTH: 389 words



HIGHLIGHT: Surfers and boaters pay tribute to the inventor, who died March 29 at
his Palm Desert home.


Hobie Alter had only one request: He wanted a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out
ceremony after he died.

Alter died March 29 at his Palm Desert home after a bout with cancer. He was 80.

Keeping to his wishes, in the blue waters off Dana Point and surrounded by
surfboards and sailboats, Alter's family on April 18 released bowls filled with
soil brought from Hawaii, ocean water and sand from Waikiki beach, and rock
salt, which represented the "purification of one's soul, body and life," said
Eric Keawe, a "kahu," or Hawaiian priest.

Surfers gathered on boards hooted after a prayer in the form of a Hawaiian song,
splashing water and holding up paddles with the Hobie insignia.

Boats surrounded the group, while the Orange County Harbor Patrol boat sprayed
water, creating a rainbow in its mist.

Hundreds of people paddled out in Alter's honor, paying tribute to a man who
changed the way people use the water for surfing and sailing. He is credited
with transforming the foundation of a surfboard from balsa wood to foam, and
then revolutionized the sailboat by creating the Hobie Cat, a catamaran dubbed
the "people's boat" because of the ease of use and low cost.

Well-known surfer and shaper Mickey Muñoz remembers Alter giving him a job at
his shop in Dana Point, the first of its kind in Southern California.

He did ding repairs on boards for Alter in the early '50s.

"I think his legacy is 'Have a Hobie Day.' How better can you say it?" Muñoz
said, referring to Alter's longtime slogan.

In 1954, Alter opened a custom surfboard factory and showroom in Dana Point.

In the late '60s, Alter started to design sailboats - specifically smaller boats
that were affordable at $999. The boats could be launched from the beach.

Rob Green of Carlsbad brought a board that his father, Larry, gave him. The
40-pound board had the number 112 on it, thought to be the 12th board Alter
shaped. For unknown reasons, Alter numbered his boards starting at 100, Green
said.

"I think it's great to get it out of the garage and let people see it," said
Green, who planned on paddling out on it. "He changed so many lives, all over
the place. It's great for people to break this stuff out and get it out here so
people can get a full spectrum of all the stuff he accomplished.

"I know my dad would have appreciated it being here," he said.

Earl emerges as Aladdin's best bet

BYLINE: by Jonathan Berke

SECTION: BANKRUPT

LENGTH: 654 words

HIGHLIGHT: It's unclear if the Planet Hollywood co-founder will face any rival
bidders in Friday's auction for the bankrupt Las Vegas property.


After a couple of days of negotiations, it's become clear that an investment
group headed by Planet Hollywood co-founder Robert Earl has improved its odds to
buy Aladdin Hotel & Casino.

But it's uncertain if anyone else will join them at the bidders' table during
Friday's auction for the bankrupt property.

Earl, Starwood Resorts & Hotels Worldwide Inc. and Bay Harbour Management have
in hand a court-approved stalking-horse bid to acquire the Aladdin for $90
million in cash and the assumption of $510 million in debt.

Should anyone else wish to hit the auction table Friday, June 20, they must
first bid $17.5 million higher than what Earl's group is offering.

While Richard Alter's Los Angeles-based Financial Capital Investment Co. made no
secret of wanting to be a bidder, sources said there's been a snafu in its
buyout plan.

KenPat Entertainment Group, another California investment group, dropped out of
the bidding because of issues with Trizec Properties Inc., owners of Aladdin's
Desert Passage mall.

Alter's group, which includes Marriott International Inc., was shot down by
Aladdin's bankers because it chose former Harrah's Las Vegas vice president
William Noble to be floor manager.

Earl's spokesman said Alter's group has since replaced Noble with former
Caesar's Palace president and COO Dean Harrold. As of press time Thursday, it
was unknown if Aladdin's bankers approve this move.

If no one makes a counterbid, then Earl's group would likely be confirmed as the
winning bidder for Aladdin on Friday before Judge Robert Jones of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada in Las Vegas.

Aladdin's bankers were mulling four offers this week and The Deal has learned
they have whittled these down to two.

But it's unknown if Alter will appear at Friday's auction as one of those two
bidders. Alter, who is looking to convert the Aladdin into a slot-machine-laced
resort called Asia, could not be reached for comment Thursday.

In the meantime, KenPat's attorney Frederico Sayre said his company had made
overtures to Trizec, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust, to buy the
Desert Passage outright.

Trizec, which has been trying to rid itself of the mall for some time,
ultimately passed on a bid from KenPat, which then walked away. Trizec offered
no comment Thursday.

According to sources close to the situation, both Earl's and Alter's group are
exploring the idea of leasing space from Trizec to enlarge the casino. (The
116,000-square-foot casino floor is derided as too small by Las Vegas standards
and is one of the main detractions of the Aladdin.)

Either way, casino analysts continue to be wary of both the Earl and Alter
groups. "The bidders don't have the financial strength you would like to see,"
said one high-yield gaming analyst.

The two groups were not among those whom people had talked about buying Aladdin
after it filed for bankruptcy protection in August 2001.

At one point, Park Place Entertainment Corp. had a position in Aladdin's debt
but never appeared that interested in the property.

And Los Angeles-based private equity firm Colony Capital Inc. was in a position
in fall 2002 to be Aladdin's stalking-horse bidder, but its offer never went
anywhere.

People remain unconvinced on Earl's group's idea of converting Aladdin into a
Planet Hollywood-themed casino given that the restaurant chain has itself has
been in bankruptcy twice.

Among the many problems an Aladdin buyer might face: It's believed that it may
take between $75 million to $100 million to renovate and rebrand the resort.

This would include rebuilding Aladdin's entrance, which was constructed without
offering direct access to the casino floor.

Jeffrey Truitt of KPMG LLC has been marketing the property. Las Vegas law firm
of Gordon & Silver Ltd. is representing Aladdin.

Rivals rooting for net success;
GGCL volleyball foes Alter, Fenwick hope to cheer each other on at state
volleyball finals.

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 328 words


The best thing to happen to Alter's ultra-successful volleyball team is to be
paired away from Fenwick in the postseason.

The Girls Greater Cincinnati League Grey North rivals have met twice this season
and both close matches were won by the Falcons. But now they're each other's
most vocal supporters.

As the Springboro Division II sectional top seed, Alter (15-7) joins in the
postseason fun today, playing Franklin at 6 p.m.

Fenwick (21-1) also is a top seed, but in the D-III sectional at Monroe. The
GGCL Grey champ Falcons play Hamilton Badin in their postseason opener at 6 p.m.
on Thursday.

Both Alter and Fenwick could provide the upcoming state tournament with a dose
of GGCL swagger. The three-day, four-division event once again returns to Wright
State University's Ervin J. Nutter Center on Nov. 11-13.

They are just two of several powerful area teams that hope to advance through
the sectional, district and regional in bids to qualify for state. Sectional
play began last weekend.

Alter has state history on its side. The Knights won state D-II championships in
2002, '03 and '06. Alter fell to Parma Padua Franciscan in the 2008 final. Padua
defended its title last year and is shooting for a three-peat.

Fenwick, a D-III state semifinalist last season, was No. 2 in the D-III final
state poll, released Monday by the Ohio High School Volleyball Coaches
Association. Middletown Madison (21-1) was No. 3.

Alter was No. 10 in the final D-II state poll, the only area team to crack those
rankings. No area D-I team was ranked.

If the final D-IV state poll is accurate, the state tourney should be full of
area teams.

Three-time defending state champ Marion Local (21-1) held the top spot the
entire season. Weighing in at No. 2 is Lehman Catholic (21-1) and No. 3 is Fort
Loramie (19-3). St. Henry (19-5), like Marion a Midwest Athletic Conference
rival, is No. 5.

Lehman Catholic is top seeded in the Tipp City sectional. The Cavs open with
Miami Valley at 6 p.m. today.

CENTURY-old vintage tram which was key to the First World War effort drew an
international crowd at Albert Square.

As part of remembrance events and in celebration of the launch of the airport
tram line, number 765 tram made its first visit to Manchester town hall.

Built in 1914 as part of the Manchester Corporation Tramways fleet, it is the
only remaining car from the time left in regular operation - at Heaton Park. In
its early days it was used as a recruitment vehicle during the First World War.

Hon Alderman Keith Whitmore, chairman of the Heaton Park Manchester Tramway
Company, said: "We had people from Holland, China and Saudi Arabia. I am over
the moon that we have been able to bring an original Manchester tram into Albert
Square."

Alter grad earns job as Oden's 'bodyguard';
Ullmer is one of nine student managers for the Ohio State basketball team, and
he sits by the star during interviews.

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 382 words


ATLANTA - Forget Mike Conley Jr. or coach Thad Matta. Matt Ullmer is Greg Oden's
right-hand man.

The 2004 Alter High School graduate and college junior is one of nine student
managers for the Ohio State men's basketball program. But he (on the right) and
Ty Shepfer (on the left) are the "bodyguards" during Oden's interviews.

"We started at the beginning of the NCAA tournament and we were sitting there
eating lunch one day," Ullmer said Friday. "Greg is like, 'You'd better stay and
sit here during media, because everyone swarms during NCAA,' and it crowds him.
He likes to have a little breathing room."

Ullmer didn't just show up in Columbus expecting student-manager status. He
prepared.

Ullmer's older brother, Mike, was a student-manager at Ohio State during the
Buckeyes' 1999 tournament run. Matt also worked under Joe Petrocelli at Alter.
Ullmer said his basketball career ended after middle school.

"I just wanted to stay involved in basketball," Ullmer said. "That looked like
the best opportunity to do it."

The managers eat with the team, copy scouting reports and enjoy brushes with
greatness.

"(Wisconsin's) Alando Tucker and (Texas') Kevin Durant were at the same place we
were and (CBS announcer) Jim Nantz," Ullmer said. "It's just kind of cool to see
all these familiar faces and celebrities just out. It's like it's normal when
you see them so much."

They didn't start any conversations, though.

"Greg went up and talked to Kevin," Ullmer said. "We were kind of shy and we
didn't really want to introduce ourselves."

Ullmer said the new LeBron shoes keep ripping, so the Buckeyes have 20 extra
pairs. That sort of information impresses Ullmer's roommates.

"They're like, 'Wow, you talk to Greg.' They think he's the greatest thing
ever," Ullmer said before going to the Georgia Dome court for OSU's
shoot-around. "He's just a guy I see every day in practice."

Alter grad is Duke's all-time leading setter

BYLINE: Mark Gokavi COLLEGE CONNECTION

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 449 words


Alter High School graduate Ali Hausfeld recently became Duke's all-time assists
leader in volleyball.

Hausfeld has more than 5,100 assists for the 11-3, No. 13-ranked Blue Devils.
The 6-foot senior setter was the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the
Year.

"I was very lucky to have an opportunity as a freshman to play right away,"
Hausfeld said. "Obviously, that helps when you're trying to get career records.
I have to thank Alter for having me prepared academically and in volleyball."

Carrie DeMange, Hausfeld's teammate at Alter and Duke, was recently named ACC
Player of the Week for a second time. DeMange is among the ACC leaders in kills
and points.

"It's been amazing playing with Carrie this long," Hausfeld said. "I couldn't
ask for a better hitter and passer. It's benefited both of us."

Ali isn't the only Hausfeld on a top-20 team. Her younger sister, Kacie
Hausfeld, is a freshman setter for No. 15 Dayton.

"I've got to say their team is having the better season. They're undefeated,"
said Ali, who plans to go to medical school. "We're having a great season, too.

"Maybe we'll see Dayton in the (NCAA) tournament. That would be weird, since we
talk all the time and it's like we know each other's teams."

Elks lead NKU

Three Centerville graduates are key contributors on the No. 1-ranked NCAA
Division II men's soccer team at Northern Kentucky University.

Senior midfielder Kyle Roberts, junior defenseman Eric Ashworth and sophomore
forward Braden Bishop led the Norse to a 12-0 start. Bishop leads NKU in goals
with eight.

On campus

* Columbia freshman football linebacker Alex Gross (Fairmont) was named the Ivy
League's Rookie of the Week for the second time this season. Gross had 13
tackles in a 42-32 loss to Princeton.

Gross' teammate, 5-6 senior corner JoJo Smith (Chaminade-Julienne), is a team
captain.

"He wins on effort," Columbia coach Norries Wilson said of Smith. "And his
effort is the driving force behind his play and overcoming his physical
limitations."

* Miami junior Joey Hudson (Piqua) was named Mid-American Conference East
defensive player of the week. Hudson had 10 tackles and 1.5 sacks against
Syracuse.

Redshirt freshman Donovan Potter (C-J) has 40 yards on four catches.

* Ohio's Kari Summers (Troy) was named MAC women's cross country runner of the
week after taking third at an invitational at Bowling Green and 45th at the
Notre Dame Invitational.

* Kent State's Laura Neufarth (Centerville) earned two such awards earlier this
season.

Jordan Hibner and Jessica Wuensch accepted the Mayor's Award for Youth Volunteer
Service from Mayor Don Patterson at the Kettering City Council meeting April 12.

The award presentation was part of the activities for National Volunteer Week,
held from April 10-16.

Hibner, a senior at Alter High School, volunteers with Alter Key Club, Peer
Ministry, (where she leads retreats and plans liturgies), Art Club, and she is a
student ambassador to the community for Alter High School. She has volunteered
for organizations such as We Care Arts, Lincoln Park Nursing Home, City of
Kettering and St. Charles Church.

Her most impressive service projects are the ones she participates in on her
own. During her spring break this year, Jordan is going to New Orleans on a
mission trip to help build houses. For the past six years she has put in 10-hour
Saturdays for Rebuilding Together Dayton, and she volunteers for Habitat for
Humanity. Jordan raised $3,000 last year for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation,
riding her bike 100 miles in one day to earn the money.

Wuensch, a junior at Fairmont High School, devotes many of her volunteer hours
to the City of Kettering. She is the youth representative for the city's Board
of Community Relations, attending monthly board meetings and helping to
facilitate three forums that the board presents annually. Some of her other
duties with the BCR Board include diversity training at Fairmont High School and
creating a BCR Facebook page. She was the youth leader for the 2011 Martin
Luther King Breakfast, including recruiting youth volunteers.

Wuensch serves on the leadership team for the Kettering Youth Council and is a
board member on Partners for Healthy Youth. She has spent countless hours
volunteering for St. Albert the Great Church, helping with vacation Bible school
and religious education classes. She also holds leadership roles at Fairmont
High School with the Spanish club, AFS club, and Scrapbooking club and is prom
chairperson.

ONE TERRIFIC TRIO;
Alter, Marion Local, Covington lead AP state polls.;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: ; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 481 words


Alter (10-0), which crushed Chaminade Julienne 51-3 in Week 10 to secure an
outright North Division title, has been crowned D-IV poll champ for a third
time.

Marion Local (9-1), battling Coldwater on Sept. 9, has been named a D-V, D-VI or
D-VII poll champ six times. Coldwater (D-V) was No. 1 until a loss in Week 7.

Alter has collected one more reason for opponents to hike up their games against
the Knights. Alter (Division IV), Marion Local (D-VI) and Covington (D-VII) were
named Associated Press high school football state poll champions Monday.

"The No. 1 ranking puts a little bit bigger target on your back, but let's face
it, people are going to be fired up to play Alter," Knights coach Ed Domsitz
said. "It's not like we don't get your best shot, anyway."

It's the third time Alter (10-0) has been crowned the D-IV poll champ. Other
top-ranked Knights teams were in 2014 and '09. The Knights are on a 56-3-1
regular-season run over the last six years. The final poll was the only time
Alter was No. 1 following a Week 10 loss to previously top-ranked
Johnstown-Monroe.

Marion Local (9-1) has been named a D-V, D-VI or D-VII poll champ six times,
including the last four seasons. It's the second time for Covington (10-0) to be
named a small-school poll champ. The Buccs also were the D-VI top team in 2006.

Finishing runner-up were Wayne (D-I) for the second straight year and Coldwater
(D-V), which was No. 1 until falling to Midwest Athletic Conference rival
Minster in Week 7.

Alter crushed Greater Catholic League Co-Ed rival Chaminade Julienne 51-3 in
Week 10 to secure an outright North Division title. The No. 3 seed Knights will
host Cincinnati Indian Hill (9-1) in the first round of the D-IV, Region 16
playoffs at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Fairmont's Roush Stadium.

"I've very proud of what our kids have done this year," Domsitz said. "It's a
nice honor to think that people throughout the state recognize our program.
That's a positive thing, and I think the kids have earned it. The postseason
presents a whole different set of problems. We'll see if we can sustain what
we've built thus far."

Marion Local lost only in Week 3 to Coldwater, 17-14. The Flyers are top-seeded
in D-VI, Region 24 and host West Liberty-Salem (6-4) on Friday. Coach Tim
Goodwin's Flyers had a streak of four straight state titles snapped in last
year's D-VI title game to Kirtland.

First-year coach Tyler Cates has maintained the high level of play that was the
norm under former Covington coach Dave Miller, now at Fairmont. The Buccs are
the No. 1 seed in D-VII, Region 28 and host Cincinnati Hillcrest Academy (8-2)
on Saturday.

Other poll winners were Cincinnati Colerain (D-I), Avon (D-II), Toledo Central
Catholic (D-III) and Wheelersburg (D-V).

Weekly rankings were voted on by a statewide media panel.

Alter, CJ collect key rivalry wins

BYLINE: Staff reports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 234 words


It was a good night to be a Girls Greater Cincinnati League team.

The Greater Western Ohio Conference? Not as much.

The GGCL swept a pair of high-profile matchups in girls high school basketball
on Monday, Jan. 25, as Alter and Chaminade Julienne scored wins against Fairmont
and Beavercreek, respectively.

The only thing better for Knights and Eagles? They'll go head-to-head on Friday
at the Nutter Center.

Alter, ranked No. 1 in the state in Division II, improved to 15-0 with a late
spurt led by guard Ashley Christie's 17 points in a 48-39 win.

The Knights held University of Dayton recruit Cassie Sant, a Fairmont forward,
to eight points while closing out the Firebirds with a 20-9 game-ending stretch.

"They've been consistent all year, not too high or too low," Alter coach Chris
Hart said of her team.

CJ took the latest round in what has been the area's top girls basketball
rivalry with a - victory against the Beavers. Eagles sophomore Raytea Long
combined 15 points and 11 rebounds to help CJ improve to 11-5.

"It was great to see Ray-tea have a game like this," CJ coach Duane Williams
said. "She's shown flashes of how good she can be and picked a good night put it
together."

Alter used a Christie basket with 5.7 seconds left to beat CJ 46-45 in their
first meeting on Dec. 16. They'll tip at 6 p.m. Friday as part of a doubleheader
with the boys teams coming off emotional wins against the GWOC.

Alter 'steps up,' claims state championship

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 450 words


COLUMBUS - During its snowbound weekend, the Alter High School girls basketball
team watched the movie "Step Up 2."

"It was just about dancing, street dancing," sophomore Ashley Christie said. "It
was really cool. I wish I could do some of that stuff."

Christie and her teammates did some stepping up of their own in beating Shaker
Heights Hathaway Brown 60-46 on Monday, March 10, for Alter's first girls
basketball state championship.

"Step up" may be overused in sports, but it definitely applied in the Division
II title game, which was delayed two days.

Christie scored 20 points while her sister - senior Nicole - and Mary Bruner
each added 12 at the Schottenstein Center.

The Knights broke it open with a 21-6 game-ending run.

"Congratulations to our kids," Alter coach Christina Hart said. "It's an awful
lot of hard work."

Alter (25-3) got just nine points combined from leading scorer Courtney Chihil
and third-leading scorer Meghan Waterman. But Ashley Christie (8.7) and Bruner
(3.5) each scored well above their averages.

"If you would have told me that we were going to hold Waterman to seven and
Chihil to two, I would've said I'd take it," said Hathaway Brown coach Paul
Barlow, whose team is state runner-up a second straight year.

Instead, the Blazers (22-5) got a glimpse of Alter's balance and depth.

"We're a team, and on any given night a number of our kids step up," said Hart,
repeating the phrase of the day. "That's one of the things that makes us
difficult to prepare for and to guard. You don't know who it's going to be."

Alter ran out to 9-0 and 16-7 first-quarter leads by forcing 10 of Hathaway
Brown's 24 turnovers. Behind one 3-pointer from Nicole Christie and three from
Ashley, Alter was up 28-14.

"There's always points in the game where everyone knows you need a bucket and
it's just up to the team - whoever has the open shot should take it," Ashley
Christie said.

But the younger Christie got her second foul, headed to the bench and took
Alter's momentum with her. Hart and co-coach Kendal Peck debated bringing
Christie back before halftime, but did not.

Mylan Woods (14 points) and Alexis Dobbs (11) helped Hathaway Brown get within
30-27 at the half and the Blazers had a brief 37-35 lead.

Alter fought off the eight blocks from HB's Angela Groves and won the rebounding
battle, 34-32. With a 41-40 lead, Alter got a Nicole Christie 3 and a
three-point play and steal from Waterman for a 47-40 lead. Layups and free
throws iced it.

Alter girls get revenge, zoom into regional final;
Knights crush Eastmoor 72-37 after Columbus team ousted them last season.

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 381 words


VANDALIA - Alter's start against Columbus Eastmoor was so good that there was no
second-half tension.

"We had a good start against them last year, too," said Alter coach Christina
Hart, whose team lost a regional game by one point to Eastmoor last season. "I
thought we were able to keep the pressure on this year."

The Knights girls basketball team pressured Eastmoor into 20-plus turnovers and
sailed to a 72-37 victory in the Division II regional semifinal.

The win Tuesday, Feb. 26, puts the Knights (22-3) into the regional final
against Girls Greater Cincinnati League rival Carroll (20-5) on Friday, Feb. 29.

Alter led 15-3 after the first quarter and 38-11 at halftime. Seniors Courtney
Chihil (19 points) and Meghan Waterman (17) led a suffocating defense and
transition offense that at times bordered perfection.

"That first half has to be one of the best first halves ever, I would say," Hart
said. "It's among the best, that's for sure.

"Over the years, we've had some really good halves or good, outstanding quarters
in some big games. But that first half was unbelievable."

Alter fronted and double-teamed Louisiana State-bound center Ayana Dunning. She
was held to 11 points and didn't get many looks because the Knights stole so
many passes from Eastmoor (17-5).

"We were just clicking," Chihil said. "I remember looking at Meghan, like, 'This
is it, we just have to keep going.' " TO DAY 'S G I R L S B A S K E T B A L L R

Hobart ('Hobie');
Obituaries Alter Designer who rode the California surfing boom of the Sixties
and went on to 'democratise'the catamaran

SECTION: FEATURES; OFFERS; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 932 words


HOBART ("HOBIE") ALTER, who has died aged 80, transformed California's surfer
culture when he popularised cheap fibreglass and foam surfboards; later he
extended his influence to the production of racing sailboats, while his Hobie 16
"beach catamaran" has become ubiquitous among fans of the sport.

When Alter first discovered surfing, at his family's Laguna Beach summerhouse in
the early 1950s, there were only about 200 fellow surfers in the whole of
California. Camping out on the beach for days at a time, they rode the waves on
bronze-coloured surfboards made of balsa wood.

A few of the most enterprising professionals, such as the brothers Walter and
Philip "Flippy" Hoffman, had established their own cottage industries to
manufacture boards at a profit - and it was the younger brother, Walter, who
first showed the teenage Hobart where to buy the materials for his own
balsa-and-fibreglass creations.

Working first in his parents' garage, and later from a small factory at Dana
Point, Alter had soon sold close to 1,700 boards; but demand was outstripping
his supply of balsa wood, which was very expensive and had to be imported. Balsa
also tended to absorb water if the board was damaged.

Together with Gordon "Grubby" Clark, hired to the newly established Hobie
Surfboards firm in 1957, Alter began experimenting with a dense foam called
polyurethane. Other entrepreneurs had already tried producing "blanks" (the
original block from which a surfboard was shaped) from the stuff, and a few had
even managed to turn out effective boards. Alter and Clark, however, took the
enterprise a step further. They hired a shack in Laguna Canyon, blacked out the
windows against curious onlookers, and began pouring blocks of foam on a scale
not seen before.

The resulting foam cores proved highly flexible and durable - qualities which
Alter tested by standing on top of a high cliff and flinging a finished blank on
to the rocks below.

Alter's breakthrough coincided almost exactly with the release of Gidget (1959),
with Sandra Dee, a precursor to the "beach party" genre, and the film most
widely credited with bringing the surfer lifestyle to international attention.
Before long, newspapers and magazines had begun referring to Alter as "the Henry
Ford of surfing".

While Clark departed to launch his own company, Clark Foam, Alter became the
leading manufacturer in its field, producing upwards of 6,000 boards a year.
Shops bearing the Hobie name opened in San Diego, Hawaii and Peru, and Alter
secured sponsorship deals among the first generation of professional surfers,
who gave their names to new models such as the 1963 Hobie-Phil Edwards board.

Not content with limiting himself to one stratum of youth culture, Alter went on
to capitalise on the nascent craze of skateboarding - or "sidewalk surfing", as
it was then known - by developing one of the world's first skateboard brands
with the Vita-Pakt juice company belonging to Barron Hilton (of Hilton Hotels).

But the bottom soon fell out of the skateboarding market amid safety concerns.
As the pastime disappeared underground, Alter branched out again, with a design
for a two-person 14ft catamaran. Inspiration for the venture came from the
difficulties of handling his own 18ft "cat", which held only two people but
needed a team of six to launch it. By contrast the Hobie 14 - and its still more
popular siblings, the Hobie 16 and Hobie 18 - were fast, easy to manoeuvre and
relatively inexpensive.

Alter's design effectively democratised the sport, appealing not just to the
yacht club elite but also to any enthusiast with money to spare and an available
beach. Since its creation in 1971 the ISAF International Class Hobie 16 (to give
it its full title) remains the world's bestselling catamaran, with approximately
150,000 still sailing today.

The son of a Californian orange grower, Hobart Laidlaw Alter was born in Ontario
on October 31 1933 and graduated from Laguna Beach High School aged 17. During
the summer that followed, Hobart and his fellow surfing enthusiasts gathered on
the beach to discuss their future plans - or lack of them.

At Hobart's suggestion, they came up with a manifesto based on a unanimous
reluctance to conform, beginning with Hobart's own vow: "We won't wear suits and
ties." Other declarations followed: "We won't wear hard shoes"; and "We won't
work regular hours that might interrupt our surf time". Though Alter's adult
professional image was one of clean-cut respectability, something of that
laid-back surfer spirit remained in the company motto: "Have A Hobie Day".

After two years' studying business administration at Chaffey College in Rancho
Cucamonga, Alter returned to Laguna Beach and dedicated himself to the
manufacture of boards. During his spare time he competed in various
international surfing competitions, and entered the 1964 Guinness Book of World
Records by surfing 26 miles in the wake of a motorboat, from Long Beach to
Catalina Island.

The sale of his catamaran business to the Coleman company in 1976 gave Alter the
chance to explore further avenues of interest. He created a radio-controlled
glider named the Hobie Hawk, and helped to design eponymous ranges of swimwear,
sporting gear and sunglasses.

Following his permanent retirement in 1992, Alter dedicated his energies to the
design and construction of a 60ft power catamaran for his personal use, which he
kept anchored off an island in America's Pacific Northwest.

Hobie Alter is survived by his wife, Susan, and by three children.

Boys top C-J; girls reach state title game

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 242 words


Alter High School basketball fans had two seasons to celebrate.

The Alter boys advanced to Saturday's Division II regional final against
undefeated Graham with a 50-45 victory against Greater Catholic League mate
Chaminade-Julienne on Thursday, March 6, at the Nutter Center. Ryan Siggins
scored 16 points for Alter, which won its 10th straight game.

Earlier, the Alter girls defeated Columbus Mifflin in a D-II state semifinal in
Columbus.

Graham moved into the regional final after the Falcons surprised many by beating
Canal Winchester, which features 7-foot-1 Ohio State recruit B.J. Mullens,
64-50.

Meanwhile, in Columbus

In moving to Saturday's D-II state final against Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown,
the Alter girls got 18 points from Courtney Chihil and 11 more from Meghan
Waterman. It also helped that Mifflin had 26 turnovers and took just four foul
shots.

Saturday's final appearance will be the first in school history for the girls.
"It's a great opportunity for our program," said Alter coach Chris Hart.

On deck today

The Versailles girls, ranked No. 1 in the state, start the day with a 1 p.m.
D-III state semifinal against South Euclid Regina, ranked No. 2 and making its
sixth appearance at the semifinals in the past nine years.

The New Knoxville boys, ranked No. 1 in D-IV, are one step from the semifinals.
The undefeated Rangers will play Cincinnati Seven Hills in a 7:30 p.m. regional
final at UD Arena.

Knights survive giant showdown;
Free throws prove the difference in overtime thriller.;
GIRLS BASKETBALLALTER 48, TOLEDO ROGERS 47 (OT)

BYLINE: By Eric Frantz

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C6

LENGTH: 446 words


BERLIN - It can be argued Alter plays the toughest girls basketball schedule in
Ohio. It can be argued the Knights own the state's top team too, despite being
Division II.

Playing its eighth consecutive road game, Alter conquered its second Goliath in
four days, dispatching Toledo Rogers and its starting five of Division I college
recruits 48-47 in overtime at the famed Classic in the Country at Berlin Hiland
High School. Rogers (10-3) entered ranked No. 2 in the JJHuddle.com D-II state
poll and No. 5 in the AP poll. Alter (14-0) is No. 1 in both rankings.

Wednesday, the Knights won at D-I unanimous No. 1 Mason, 52-43.

Time to exhale.

"Seriously," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "This has been a tough week. And we
knew it was going to be. Credit to our kids for staying focused. They've gotten
themselves prepared and it's showed."

The meeting was the teams' second in 11 months after tangling in last year's
D-II state semifinals, when the Knights won 50-47.

This one was better.

Tied 35-35 after the third quarter, Rogers held a 43-39 lead with less than two
minutes to play. The Knights converted all four of their free-throw attempts in
the final 54 seconds, the last two from sophomore Libby Bazelak, tying the game
with 14 ticks left. Rogers went 0- for-3 at the line in the final 90 seconds.

In overtime, Alter rallied twice from one-point deficits in the final minute.
Both responses came courtesy of junior Maddie Bazelak. Down 45-44, Bazelak hit
two free throws to give Alter a lead it surrendered 11 seconds later. Facing a
47-46 deficit, Bazelak's driving layup with eight seconds left gave Alter the
win. It was the Knights' second basket in the final 12 minutes.

Alter hit nine of 12 free throws in the fourth quarter and OT to survive.

"I don't know what was going through my mind," Bazelak said of her winning
drive. "I just knew if I had an open shot I was going to take it."

Junior Emma Bockrath led the Knights with 17 points, while Akienreh Johnson, one
of three Rogers starters committed to Michigan (the other two are headed to
Xavier and Cincinnati) scored a game-high 19.

"This is big motivation," Toledo Rogers coach Lamar Smith said. "The girls are
hurt. We thought we had this one."

Said Hart: "Our kids never give up and they pay attention to detail, especially
at the end of games. They know how to handle different situations and it takes
an awful lot of character to set up and be able to hit those (free throws).
Especially in this type of setting."

"We have trust in each other in all situations," Bazelak said. "We know anyone
can step up and make the play for us."

Alter finishes first ... no, second;
Ofcials forced to sort out results after time chips switch

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton mpendleton@daytondailynews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C7

LENGTH: 522 words


COLUMBUS - The Alter girls cross country team hoisted the Division II cross
country state team trophy. Teammates were congratulated and photos were clicked.
Then the Knights handed off and watched North Bend Taylor do the same.

It was fitting that such a bizarre scene would end Saturday's state cross
country meet at Scioto Downs. Of the six races, the DII and D-I girls were
hardest hit by finish chip malfunctions, finish camera glitches and blank
results. Officials needed about six hours - long after the stadium was cleared
of its 10,000 spectators and runners - to belatedly sort individual and team
results.

Alter 's tight pack couldn't overcome a huge drop by NBT's fifth runner, who
made up 30 places on her Alter counterpart from last week's regional. That was
the deciding factor in NBT's 77-83 delayed win.

"We're extremely happy regardless of the result," Alter boys and girls coach
Matt Sableski said.

Finish time chips have been used here for three years. They worked perfectly,
except for those teams that inadvertently switched chips among their boys and
girls teams. The jumbled results could easily have been resolved by finish line
video, had the head-on camera not malfunctioned. That left only a side angle to
sort runners, which was hopeless without faces and matching numbers. And it got
worse: a massive girls D-I pileup clogged the finish chute and a string to
manually sort runners was in disarray. A plea for coaches "who think their
runners placed from 40th-80th" was made.

Times and places are unofficial. What is certain is that freshman Mary Untener
paced Alter in the 5K race, placing 13th in 19 minutes, 35 seconds. She was
followed by Lauren Bockrath (13th), Emily Untener (35th), Anne Colavincenzo
(37th) and Emily Zimmerman (45th).

"We stayed together (as a pack) until the second mile," said Mary Untener, who
clipped a 6:09 opening mile. "It's good because we all ran as good as we could.
We did our best."

No one did it better than Indian Lake's Brittany Tinsley. The senior needed just
one minute to put 30 meters on the field.

"That was the greatest start I've ever had," said Tinsley, who busted a 5:26
opening mile and was never challenged (18:08).

* D-I girls: Fairmont's Venessa Gilbert owned Kelly Schwieterman of Springboro,
until Saturday. Schwieterman stuck with the leaders and closed hard to place
third (18:32). It was the first time she had beaten the senior Gilbert (5th,
18:43) in a half-dozen races.

"I just tried to stay with (Gilbert) as long as I could," said Schwieterman, a
junior. "I just wanted to get out quick and stay there and not fade."

Mason junior Angela Bizzari defended her '03 state title (18: 18). Troy regional
placers claimed five of the top six places.

* D-III girls: Minster picked a fine time to overtake Versailles, bunching four
runners among the top 19 to edge the Tigers 71-76 in the team race. Sophomore
Brigitte Sherman led Minster (7th, 19:29) and sophomore Kristin Smith paced
Versailles (11th, 19:36).

Anna sophomore Sarah Schulze won (18:52) and Waynesville junior Elyse Velte was
eighth (19:30).

Hundreds paddle out to honor Hobie Alter

BYLINE: BY LAYLAN CONNELLY, Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A

LENGTH: 383 words



HIGHLIGHT: Surfers, boaters pay tribute to the inventor off Dana Point.


Hobie Alter had only one request: He wanted a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out
ceremony after he died.

In the blue waters off Dana Point and surrounded by surfboards and sailboats,
Alter's family on Friday released bowls filled with soil brought from Hawaii,
ocean water and sand from Waikiki beach, and rock salt, which represented the
"purification of one's soul, body and life," said Eric Keawe, a "Kahu," or
Hawaiian priest.

Surfers gathered on boards hooted after a prayer in the form of a Hawaiian song,
splashing water and holding up paddles with the Hobie insignia. Boats surrounded
the group, while the Orange County Harbor Patrol boat sprayed water, creating a
rainbow in its mist.

Hundreds of people paddled out in Alter's honor Friday, paying tribute to a man
who changed the way people use the water for surfing and sailing. He is credited
for transforming the foundation of a surfboard from balsa wood to foam, and then
revolutionized the sailboat by creating the Hobie Cat, a catamaran dubbed the
"people's boat" because of the ease of use and low cost.

Alter died March 29 at his Palm Desert home after a bout with cancer. He was 80.

Well-known surfer and shaper Mickey Munoz remembers Alter giving him a job at
his shop in Dana Point, the first of its kind in Southern California. He did
doing ding repairs on boards for Alter in the early '50s.

"I think his legacy is 'Have a Hobie Day.' How better can you say it?" Munoz
said, referring to Alter's longtime slogan.

In 1954, Alter opened a custom surfboard factory and showroom in Dana Point. In
the late '60s, Alter started to design sailboats - specifically smaller boats
that were affordable at $999. The boats could be launched from the beach.

Rob Green of Carlsbad brought a board that his father, Larry, gave him. The
40-pound board had the number 112 on it, thought to be the 12th board Alter
shaped. For unknown reasons, Alter numbered his boards starting at 100, Green
said.

"I think it's great to get it out of the garage and let people see it," said
Green, who planned on paddling out on it. "He changed so many lives, all over
the place. It's great for people to break this stuff out and get it out here so
people can get a full spectrum of all the stuff he accomplished. I know my dad
would have appreciated it being here."

New techniques lower penis enlargement risks

BYLINE: Tim Friend

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 284 words


Penis enlargement surgery may include a high risk of complications
and deformities, but a new study suggests problems can be corrected
with more advanced techniques.

Up to 10,000 men in the USA have had a penis enlargement, and
a "significant percentage have deformities that they cannot get
corrected," says urologist and plastic surgeon Gary Alter, Beverly
Hills, Calif.

Older techniques of fat injections and penis lengthening using
a skin flap from the lower abdomen can cause deformities, such
as lumps, bent shafts, excess penile skin and other distortions,
Alter says.

He presented findings Wednesday at a meeting of the American Urological
Association on 19 men whose complications were successfully corrected
by newer techniques.

Currently, there are no established guidelines for enlargements.

"There are many different ways of doing penis enlargement surgeries,"
says Alter, an assistant clinical professor of surgery at UCLA
School of Medicine. "A few doctors are doing large volumes of
surgery in a rather sloppy manner with techniques that were rather
faulty."

Experts estimate that only 10 to 15 doctors perform the surgery
in the USA. No organization keeps records on the number of surgeries
or complications.

Alter says most men who undergo the surgery have normal penises.

"The typical guy is between 24 and 45. He looks and seems normal
but just has a self-esteem issue about the size of his penis in
the soft or flaccid state in the locker room," Alter says.

Those who have complications after a surgery often suffer even
greater problems with self-esteem, he says, and often cannot find
doctors able to fix their problems.

Director talks about how ATC is growing

BYLINE: Sam Newton Correspondent

SECTION: A; KIWANIS CLUB; Pg. 5A

LENGTH: 367  words


The meeting of the Flagler Palm Coast Kiwanis Club touched many bases last week,
when Senior-of-the-Month Jonathan Alter was honored, Dale Hamilton of Florida
Hospital-Flagler spoke and Stanley Sidor, executive direc tor of Advanced
Technology Center was the guest speaker.

Alter, accompanied by his parents, Laurie and Dr. Dennis Alter, was introduced
by committee chairman Jay Ciser and then spoke to the club. In high school,
Alter is captain of the cross country team, a member of the track team and a
participant in the Student Government Association.

Other activities include membership in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and
the youth group at St. Thomas Episcopal Church. College choices include Florida
Southern College and Stetson University. When asked what he would like to do in
the future, Alter glanced at his parents and answered, "medicine."

Dale Hamilton, supervisor of environmental services at Florida Hospital-Flagler,
spoke in appreciation of the Kiwanis participation in the procurement of the
audio system for the hospital's education center.

Stanley Sidor touched on the growth of the Advanced Technology Center as he
explained the place of ATC in the workplace and the changes in technology. ATC
now has a student population of 211 high school students and 680 adult students
involved in an educational environment.

He said that during the first year, 110 students stayed and graduated from high
school and 86 percent went on to further study. Accreditation groups already
have recognized ATC.

"As technology changes with improvements, it is vital that we keep up with
improved educational opportuni ties and provide them to students," Sidor said.

ATC is a public/private partnership. Daytona Beach Community College, the
Flagler County School System and the Volusia County School System represent the
public side of the project and are joined by the ATC board of directors, which
is composed of business and community leaders who represent the private side of
the project. The ATC is a member of the Volusia/Flagler Career Connection
Consortium and is supported by the business communities of Volusia and Flagler

State titles on the line for Alter, Madison;
Dunbar, Marshall win regional semis to set up Saturday showdown for trip to
state final four.

It's thumbs up to two girls teams and three to go.

That's how many Miami Valley girls basketball teams are in the high school state
tournament final four. And for Alter and Middletown Madison, it's on to
Saturday's championships.

Alter received a combined 25 points from Courtney and Ashley Christie to
outscrap Washington Court House Miami Trace 57-46 in a rugged Division II
semifinal at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center in Columbus on Thursday, March
18.

Middletown Madison was just as good, eliminating Ironton 50-43 in its D-III
semifinal.

Alter draws defending state champ Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown in its 2 p.m.
title game and will be hoping to settle a score. The Knights were knocked out by
Hathaway Brown in last year's state semis.

Madison will square off with Findlay Liberty-Benton at 10:45 a.m. on Saturday in
a showdown of 26-0 perfect teams.

On deck today are Fairmont (D-I) and neighbors Fort Loramie and Minster, both in
D-IV.

Boys regional hoops

You wanted it, and Dunbar and Thurgood Marshall delivered.

Both the City League boys rivals won their D-II regional semifinals at Fairmont
on Thursday. Their reward is a Saturday showdown at Fairmont with a trip to the
state's final four next week at stake.

Geron Johnson was an 18-point, eight-rebound, six-assist and four-slam wrecking
machine for the Wolverines, who blitzed Columbus Watterson 65-43.

Marshall, the defending state runner-up, rode the burly game of Greg Gainey and
dodged Cincinnati Roger Bacon 47-44 to complete a City League sweep of the D-II
regional semifinals.

Gainey went for 21 points and 13 rebounds.

This is the third match between Dunbar (22-3) and Marshall (20-4), with the
Wolverines sweeping both previous games.

On deck today

Jefferson (14-10) and Fort Recovery (21-3) will battle it out in a D-IV boys
regional final at 7:30 p.m. today also at Fairmont's Trent Arena.

This is the closest the Broncos have advanced to state since winning the D-IV
title in 1999.

Alter wants to attack basket in state rematch;
Coach of defending champ says Knights pose hard matchups.;

Perhaps it's gamesmanship on her part, but Millersburg West Holmes coach Lisa
Patterson doesn't see Friday's Division II state semifinal as a rematch with
Alter.

Patterson sees it as a mismatch.

"We need about six kids out there on the floor, if not seven or eight, to try
and defend them," Patterson said. "They're so strong at every position and they
have us beat in height and size at just about every position.

"We'll need to come up with a game plan to limit their shots. I wish I could
tell you who matches up with who, but I don't think we really match up with
them."

West Holmes beat Alter 62-45 in last season's D-II state final. The teams meet
again at 1 p.m. Friday in Ohio State's Schottenstein Center.

West Holmes (24-3, No. 8 in the state) returns two starters from last season in
go-to player Brittleigh Macaulay and slashing guard Hannah Clark. Alter (28-0,
No. 1) returns five, including a pair of career 1,000-point scorers in Emma
Bockrath and Maddie Bazelak.

Alter shot a dismal 27 percent (14 of 51) in the title game last season. That's
the focus this time.

"Our biggest concern is how well they defended us last year," Knights coach
Chris Hart said. "They did a great job of not allowing us to get to the basket.
We have to improve how we attack them offensively. We did not do a good job at
all last year."

Alter makes its second straight state appearance and sixth overall. West Holmes
goes for the fourth straight season, the first program to accomplish that, and
ninth time overall.

Toledo Rogers (23-5) and Beloit West Branch (27-1) play in the second semifinal
at 3 p.m.

Division III: Versailles overcame the graduation of nine seniors to reach state
a second straight season. The Tigers lost to Columbus Africentric 49-37 in last
season's final.

At 6 tonight, Versailles (24-4) gets the state's top-ranked team, Doylestown
Chippewa (28-0).

"It's kind of an unexpected journey for us," coach Jacki Stonebraker said. "(The
seniors) wanted to make a statement and they are playing some of their best
basketball late in the season."

Versailles starts four seniors, including Lauren Bruns and Christa Puthoff, who
started last year's D-III final.

Chippewa got 25 points from Carly Koncz in its district final win and has three
players 6 feet tall.

"I'm pretty darn happy we are undefeated. Could we have taken a loss? Yes, we
could have," Chippewas coach Denny Schrock said of not worrying about the
pressure to go undefeated. "It's the hunter vs. the hunted, and it's OK to be
the hunted sometimes."

Division IV: Traditional powers clash in a 3 p.m. semifinal today when nine-time
state qualifier Fort Loramie (24-4) plays 14-time participant Berlin Hiland
(27-1).

Hallie Benanzer (school-record 50 three-pointers), Janell Hoying (school-record
14 charges taken) and Kelly Turner (10 points, 7 rebounds per game) provide the
senior leadership on a Fort Lo-ramie team that graduated eight from last year.

Despite the record, this isn't considered a typical Hiland team. The Hawks lost
five to graduation and two more decided not to come out. The only blemish on
their record is a loss to D-III state semifinalist Chippewa.

Ms. Basketball: Chagrin Falls senior Hallie Thome was named the Associated
Press' Ohio Ms. Basketball. Thome, a Michigan recruit, averaged 20.3 points, 9.3
rebounds and 4.6 blocks and led the Tigers (26-1) to the regional semifinals.

ALTER IN SPOTLIGHT;
Simmons leads a Knights team seeking to extend legendary coach's final run.;
BOYS BASKETBALL STATE SEMIFINALS

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 547 words


Alter's Jaaron Simmons powers past Dunbar's AJ Harris (12) during the regional
finals Saturday. Simmons averages 24.4 points in postseason.

KETTERING - There are three good reasons Jaaron Simmons has taken over as
Alter's showtime player: Sophomore starters Dean Lemon, Michael Schwieterman and
Kraig Howe.

With that many underclassmen, coaches always rely on seniors to take on
leadership roles. Sim-mons and Michael Spencer have done just that.

Those five have made this final season for veteran Knights coach Joe Petrocelli
memorable. That's significant, considering all the great Alter players and
teams.

The Knights (21-6) will make their ninth appearance in a final four at 8:30 p.m.
today, playing No. 2 Columbus Watterson (26-1) in the second Division II boys
high school basketball state semifinal at Ohio State University's Schottenstein
Center. Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary (19-9) plays Vin-cent Warren (26-1) in the
other semi at 5:15 p.m.

The winners return for the championship at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.

"Petro" told the Knights of his retirement plans about five games into this
season. Alter hasn't been the same since.

Undersized and deemed too young, Petrocelli feared the worst this season.
Instead, the Knights have played like all great Alter teams, overcoming
seemingly more talented opponents with unerring play and shutdown defense.

First, Valley View fell. Then Alter stunned No. 1 Thurgood Marshall 62-58 in a
sectional final. That was just a prelude.

Wilmington and Mari-on-Franklin were beaten, then Alter surprised defending D-II
state champ Dunbar 60-59 in a regional final that ranks among the all-time best
boys games in area hoop history.

"These kids just won't let me retire," Petrocelli said. "It's been quite a run."

All three of those sophomores are 6-foot-4. Lemon and Howe are burly converted
football players and do their best work near the bucket. Schwieterman has turned
into a great third option and always seems to be around the ball.

But it's the play of guards Simmons and Spencer that makes the Knights go.
Spencer (10 points) is a high-energy, up-tempo presence and top defender.
Simmons' (24.4) postseason play has rocketed off the charts.

The recruiting stock of the 6-2 Simmons has soared during the playoffs. Virginia
Tech is the latest to show interest.

The only four-year starter in Alter history, Simmons is the program's all-time
leading scorer and will own many significant individual Knights records.

"He has made so many big baskets," Petro said. "... He's a pretty good assist
man, too. If you're open, he's going to get you the ball. He's a good
combination."

The stakes are the highest in the final four. Defeating Trotwood-Madison,
Thurgood Marshall and Dunbar should be good seasoning for the Knights. It's been
10 years since Alter was last in the final four, losing to Akron SVSM and LeBron
James in the 2003 D-II title game.

Petrocelli been at Alter for 49 years. He's averaged 17 wins in the 50 seasons.
Did he think he'd coach this long?

"No, I wouldn't think 49 years in anything," he said. "We've just been blessed
with talent and it just snowballed. I love practice, but the games have worn me
down. It's time. When our last game is finished, I'm finished."

Alter mourns former player;
EKU defensive end Joey Kraemer dies in one-car crash in Kentucky.;
OBITUARY

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: ; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 500 words


Joey Kraemer, a 2014 Alter grad, transferred to Eastern Kentucky from Texas-El
Paso.

Joey Kraemer, a key member of a defensive line that Alter High School football
coach Ed Domsitz said was labeled among the Knights' best, was killed in a
one-vehicle crash at Madison County, Ky., last weekend. He was 19.

A 2014 Alter graduate, Kraemer was found early Sunday morning dead in his
vehicle, which had gone over an embankment and into a tree. The crash was near
Eastern Kentucky University at Richmond, where Kraemer was a redshirt freshman
on the football team.

"The Alter community ... is in a state of shock over his death," Domsitz said
Monday. "The kids who played (football) with him are devastated. It's always
difficult, particularly if it's a youngster. You never fully get over this."

School counselors and members of the school's theology department were available
for students on Monday. A service for all Alter students will be at 2:15 p.m.
today. Funeral arrangements are pending.

A defensive end, Kraemer was first-team All-Greater Catholic League North
Division, second team All-Southwest District and second team Divisions IV-V
All-Area as a senior. He initially attended the University of Texas at El Paso
to play football, then transferred to EKU.

"He had some choices and he wanted to play on that level (NCAA Division I),"
Domsitz said. "I told him before he left it's going to be a much different
culture down there. It's a different section of the country and I think he got a
little homesick. Eastern was much closer to home."

Alter was 11-2 when Kraemer was a senior in 2013, falling to eventual D-IV state
champion Clinton-Massie in a regional final.

"He was part of a defensive line his senior year that many people felt was our
best line in the last 15 years," Domsitz said. "He played a big role in that."

Kraemer joined the EKU team in August and had not appeared in any of the
Colonels' three games. Domsitz said Kraemer had recently returned home on a
weekend, watched an Alter game and reconnected with former Knights teammates who
now attend the University of Dayton.

"The news that we lost one of our own is devastating to me, our team and our
coaches," EKU coach Dean Hood told the school's website. "We pray that God will
give strength to Joey's family during their time of mourning. Joey will truly be
missed by all of us he touched, not only because of what he accomplished on the
football field, but because of who he was as a person and the impact he made on
our lives."

Kraemer's older brother, Nate Wolf, was a tight end at Alter.

On Saturday, Kentucky will host EKU in a non-conference game. The (Louisville)
Courier-Journal reported "My Old Kentucky Home" will be played prior to the game
as a tribute to Kraemer. Greg Hart, a 2013 Alter grad and close friend of
Kraemer's, is a member of the Kentucky team.

Domsitz said the initials "JK" will be attached to Alter's helmets.

86-year-old hurt in fight for her purse

BYLINE: JANET SHELTON ROGERS

SECTION: TAMPA BAY AND STATE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 461 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Barbra Alter always knew her mother-in-law was feisty.

What she never realized until Friday was the length to which Shirley Alter  - a
4-foot-10, 86-year-old great-grandmother - would go when wronged.

Shirley Alter was in guarded condition late Friday at St. Joseph's Hospital
after police say she tried to fight a man who had stolen her purse. She ran
after the man, and then was dragged and hit by the truck he was driving.

"This woman was 95 pounds," her daughter-in-law said afterward. "Her  shirt,
which they had to (cut) off her, had tire marks all over it . . . All  her ribs
on her left side are broken. They don't know how long her lung will  keep
working."

Tampa police said the attack occurred about 1 p.m. as Mrs. Alter returned  home
from a trip to the grocery store. She had just parked her car in the lot  of the
Carriage Park apartment complex, 2401 W Morrison Ave., when a man  approached
her and asked for directions.

As she tried to help, the man grabbed Mrs. Alter's purse and Mrs. Alter  grabbed
the man, police said. The two struggled, but the man pulled away and  ran toward
an Isuzu pickup truck that was backed into a corner of the lot.

Mrs. Alter followed, still trying to retrieve her purse. She grabbed the
truck's door as the man tried to drive away, and was dragged along the asphalt
then run over, police said.

Two construction workers at a building next door heard the commotion and
climbed over a fence to help. One man chased the truck but was unable to get a
license tag number, Barbra Alter said. The other man went to Mrs. Alter. She
was conscious but seriously injured. Her white shirt was covered with tire
tracks and her arm was turning purple.

On Friday afternoon, Mrs. Alter's neighbors clustered together and talked  about
how crime has intruded on the quiet, close-knit complex where Mrs. Alter  has
lived almost 15 years. The neighborhood crime watch captain, who asked  that her
name not be used, said the complex has experienced a rash of car  thefts
recently, but this type of violence was very different.

Police describe Mrs. Alter's assailant as a black male, about 23 years old,  6
feet tall and 220 pounds, with a large build and very short, possibly shaved
hair. He was driving a late-model tan Isuzu pickup truck with tinted windows.

Barbra Alter said she did not think it was wise for Mrs. Alter to go after  the
man, but the fact that she did doesn't surprise her daughter-in-law. Mrs.  Alter
, she said, is extremely active, alert and spirited.

"What's in the purse? $ 12 and her great-grandchildren's pictures?" she  asked a
police officer investigating the case.

"I can just see hear her now. She probably gave (the purse-snatcher) a
lecture."

Alter inducted to Hall of Fame

BYLINE: BY MARK GARCIA, THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER

LENGTH: 321 words


Hobie Alter - who opened up Southern California's first surf shop in Dana Point
in the 1950s - was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame recently at
an invitation-only ceremony at the San Diego Yacht Club.

Alter was one of 15 inductees to the inaugural class.

Alter is widely remembered as the man behind the development of the
foam-and-fiberglass surfboard. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling
surfboard brands of all time.

He is also the creator of the Hobie Cat, the Hobie 33 ultralight-displacement
sailboat and one of the finest mass-produced radio-controlled gliders, the Hobie
Hawk.

In 1958, he and his buddy Gordon "Grubby" Clark (as in Clark Foam) began
experiments making surfboards out of foam and fiberglass.

"After years of planning, we are so pleased that the heroes of our sport are
getting their long-overdue recognition," said Dick Franyo, president of the
National Sailing Hall of Fame, in a press release.

"The National Sailing Center and Hall of Fame will be a place to honor these
heroes and provide inspiration for all sailors - young and old."

The inductees are U.S. citizens 45 and older who have made a significant impact
on the growth and development of the sport in the United States, in categories
of Sailing, Technical and Contributor.

Nominations of non-citizens were also considered if they influenced the sport,
and posthumous nominations were also accepted.

Alter - who is also an inductee to the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame - is one of
five inductees from California.

The others include four-time America's Cup winning skipper Dennis Conner (San
Diego); 1968 Star Olympic Gold Medalist and founder of North Sails Lowell North
(San Diego); 1998 Whitbread Round the World Race winning skipper Paul Cayard
(Kentfield) and singlehanded circumnavigator and noted writer Joshua Slocum (San
Francisco).

Tulsa breaks ground with new sports and concert arena

If a sports and concert arena can put a city in the spotlight, Tulsa officials
believe they have the one that will do it. Their new 18,000-seat facility, set
to open in less than three years, is expected to revitalize a sluggish downtown
area and gain notoriety for the city.

Those closest to the project say that's what happens when you hire the man who
is arguably the world's most famous living architect, Cesar Pelli.

The $141 million project is being funded through a temporary 1-cent sales tax
increase approved by voters in 2003. Three related economic development measures
also passed that year, grouped under the label "Vision 2025."

The arena will be built next to Tulsa's existing convention center, which will
get a $42 million face-lift.

"We are building Tulsa's future," Mayor Bill LaFortune said at a groundbreaking
ceremony Aug. 31. "You will be able to see it take shape right here, before your
eyes, from this day forward."

The mayor said that other cities had outpaced Tulsa in recent years, leaving the
city in what he called "their construction dust."

"But today I say 'No more!'" said LaFortune. "'No more' to Oklahoma City, 'no
more' to Omaha and 'no more' to Des Moines. Tulsa is alive and well."

The 550,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to open in April 2008.

The city selected Tulsa-based Matrix Architects, Engineers, Planners Inc. to
lead the architectural and engineering team, which includes Cesar Pelli &
Associates Architects of New Haven, Conn., and ODELL Associates of Charlotte,
N.C.

The renowned Pelli, 77, designed the Petronas Towers, now the world's tallest
buildings, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and did the expansion and renovation of New
York's Museum of Modern Art. He also served as dean of Yale University's School
of Architecture for seven years.

"We will not have just another events center," Matrix President Steve Alter at
the groundbreaking. "We will have the greatest architecture and a new paradigm
in events centers in the nation."

Breaking the mold

Alter told The Journal Record that he wanted to avoid the classic arena design
most cities Tulsa's size have embraced: a bowl with services and concessions
jammed up against it with narrow entryways to the seating areas. With that
design, Alter said, patrons can't see the bowl unless they're in their seats.

"We wanted to rethink the whole paradigm of what an arena is and what it should
be," he said.

What Pelli produced was a sweeping arch design with a glass wall icon, so open
that customers can see and hear the action on the floor - and beyond - from just
about anywhere, including the concourse, the sweeping stairway, the ramp to the
upper level.

The arena will surpass by far the minimum requirements for exits, elevators and
stairs and will offer separate entrances for ticket holders, ticket buyers and,
if the city prefers, a separate entrance for premium seats.

"I think their breath is going to be taken away," Alter said. "They're going to
be completely faced with the dynamics of the event that's going on."

Tulsa is known for its art deco architecture, but neither Alter nor Pelli wanted
to copy the style. Instead, the arena is reminiscent of the streamlined art deco
style, but far from a reproduction.

"We talked about art deco and trying to avoid mimicking the rich heritage of
real art deco, but having some symbolism, contemporized of art deco elements or
themes," Alter said.

National attention

Unique in more than its design, the approved plan was the product of an unusual
team.

"Instead of just assembling a team of four or five large firms that do the same
thing, I chose people that had very distinct specialty areas," said Alter. "It
was always the intent of Tulsa to have a reputable local firm be the lead on the
project. When the RFPs (request for proposals) went out, it was up to that
architect to put the team together. I had as many local and minority-owned firms
as I could."

Perhaps more important than the construction of a new arena is the project's
significance to a city that has struggled to attract economic development since
the oil bust of the mid-1980s. The new arena was meant to be a catalyst, the
largest component and centerpiece of the $800 million bond package. Alter claims
it's already working - developers are buying up tracts downtown and the arena is
getting national attention.

"I think it's extremely significant," he said. "It's already been published and
gotten notoriety just about everywhere that Tulsa would never be mentioned - and
it hasn't even opened. It starts to put us as a city not just a place that has a
project by a well-known architect, but Tulsa will be in that classification
where there's a Frank Lloyd Wright tower. Tulsa will be a place where there's a
Cesar Pelli dynamic piece of architecture."

A wider variety of events

Shelley Britton, the administrative assistant at the project's construction
company, Tulsa Vision Builders, said no management firm had yet been chosen for
the arena. Bid packets are due by the end of September, she said. Those bids
will be reviewed by several committees before being passed on to the mayor in
30-60 days. Britton said a facility operator would likely be named by the end of
the year.

The selection process for a concessionaire won't begin until the facility
operator has been selected, Britton said.

The new arena is expected to host Tulsa's Central Hockey League team, the
Oilers, and the city's Arena Football League 2 team, the Talons.

"That's not for sure, but it's definitely something we want to happen," said
Britton. "We have to wait until their leases are up and then negotiate with
them."

The Oilers and Talons both play at the convention center, which will lose its
arena as part of its renovation when the new facility opens next door.

The proximity of the arena to the convention center is expected to be a benefit
in attracting a wider variety of events.

"The convention center will be focused more on trade shows, meetings, banquets
and events like proms and awards dinners," said Britton. "The arena will have
more entertainment - sports and music. If there's two things going on at the
same time, it's easy to go back and forth. They can complement each other - if
there's a pre-show, or meetings that need to take place, the convention center
can handle those."

City officials are in the process of raising private funds through the sale of
the naming rights and other sponsorship opportunities to enhance the arena's
budget by about $20 million.

Oakwood grad teaching drama at Alter

BYLINE: HEREABOUTS ADELE KOEHNEN

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD-2

LENGTH: 301 words


Professional performer Katie Pees, 32, of Kettering is the new drama teacher at
Alter High School.

A member of the Human Race Theatre, the cabaret singer and off-Broadway actress,
brings a wealth of experience to her new position.

"This weekend, Oct. 30, Nov. 1 and Nov. 2, Alter High School will present a
comedy titled, 'Miss Nelson Is Missing,' with 18 student cast members and eight
students in the stage crew" said Pees, a 1995 Oakwood High School graduate.

In 1999, she earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in musical theater from
Otterbein College.

After performing in many local productions, Pees took off for New York City,
staying seven years.

"I did some off-Broadway, even a one-woman show I titled, 'Katie Pees All Over
You' at the DennySkylight Cabaret, "she said.

Pees toured the United States for a few months in two shows: a leading role in
the musical "Footloose" and as a crazy nanny in a children's play "Amelia
Bedelia."

Pees also teaches drama to teenagers at the Loft Theatre in downtown Dayton as
part of the Human Race Theatre.

"But my personal roots are here in the Miami Valley, and I'm delighted to be a
part-time faculty member at Alter," Pees said.

Future plans include directing the school's annual musical in May. The dancing,
singing "Crazy For You" has been chosen.

"Katie has indeed brought enthusiasm to our drama department," said Alter
Principal Nicole Brainard. "She's dynamite and the students love her. We are all
looking forward to her first production with us this weekend."

"Miss Nelson Is Missing" will be presented at Alter High School, 940 E. David
Road, at 7 p.m. today, Oct. 30; 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sunday.

Tickets are $10 for adults and $6 for students and may be purchased at the door.

New law allows police to alter voices on 911 tapes

BYLINE: Taylor Anderson, The Cary News, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 365 words


Aug. 24--Those 911 calls the public hears on TV and the Internet will begin to
sound a little different.

Law enforcement agencies in North Carolina have begun to alter the voices on 911
call recordings before releasing them to the public, as allowed under a change
in the law in June.

Calls to 911 are considered public records under state law and are commonly
broadcast by the news media with stories about crime, fires or accidents. Now,
instead of releasing 911 calls as recorded, police are allowed to release
written transcripts or alter the recordings before making them public to protect
the identity of the callers.

The Raleigh and Durham police departments and the Wake County Sheriff's Office
are distorting the audio of every 911 recording before releasing it to the
public. Others, such the Cary Police Department, will release the calls
unaltered except under certain circumstances. Cary police Maj. Dave Wulff said
the department will mask the caller's voice only if the identity needs to be
protected for a specific reason, particularly in domestic violence cases.

None of the local agencies is considering transcribing the calls. Wake sheriff's
spokeswoman Phyllis Stephens said it would take too much time and manpower.

Stephens said the editing software the sheriff's office will use can manipulate
the audio several ways, making voices sound higher or lower or otherwise
distorted. The sound will vary with the software each agency uses and the
discretion of the person editing them.

The law clarifies that the recordings must be in their original form when used
in court.

Sen. Floyd McKissick Jr. of Durham said he and fellow Democratic Sen. Bob
Atwater of Chatham County introduced the legislation to better shield 911
callers from intimidation and threats. "Those innocent parties, who are really
just doing a good deed, won't be put at risk," McKissick said.

McKissick said voices on 911 recordings have been recognized in the past, and
that especially in gang crime cases, callers were intimidated into dropping
charges or refusing to testify.

Sailing Hall of Fame taps Hobie Alter

BYLINE: By MARK GARCIA, THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. E

LENGTH: 318 words


The National Sailing Center and Hall of Fame announced Laguna Beach's Hobie
Alter as one of 15 inductees to the inaugural class of the National Sailing Hall
of Fame recently.

"After years of planning, we are so pleased that the heroes of our sport are
getting their long-overdue recognition," said Dick Franyo, president of the
National Sailing Hall of Fame, in a news release. "The National Sailing Center
and Hall of Fame will be a place to honor these heroes and provide inspiration
for all sailors - young and old."

The inductees are U.S. citizens 45 and older who have made a significant impact
on the growth and development of the sport in the United States, in categories
of Sailing, Technical and Contributor. Nominations of noncitizens were also
considered if they influenced the sport, and posthumous nominations were also
accepted.

Alter - who is also an inductee to the Huntington Beach Walk of Fame - is one of
five inductees from California. The others include four-time America's Cup
winning skipper Dennis Conner (San Diego); 1968 Olympic gold medalist Lowell
North (San Diego); 1998 Whitbread Round the World Race winning skipper Paul
Cayard (Kentfield); and solo circumnavigator and noted writer Joshua Slocum (San
Francisco).

The inductees will be honored Oct. 23 during an invitation-only ceremony at the
San Diego Yacht Club. The National Sailing Center and Hall of Fame is in
Annapolis, Md.

Alter is widely remembered as the man behind the development of the
foam-and-fiberglass surfboard. His label, Hobie, remains one of the top-selling
surfboard brands. He is also the creator of the Hobie Cat, the Hobie 33
ultralight-displacement sailboat and one of the finest mass-produced
radio-controlled gliders, the Hobie Hawk.

Alter opened Southern California's first surf shop in Dana Point in the 1950s.
In 1958, he and Gordon "Grubby" Clark began experimenting with foam and
fiberglass surfboards.

Woody Wins A Round;
Lawyers Gain Access to Mia's Videotape of Daughter

Paula Span, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: STYLE; PAGE C1

LENGTH: 882 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 1992


Nothing in the increasingly acrimonious custody fight between Woody Allen and
Mia Farrow seems to occur without bitter accusations and public revelations.

So despite the judge's warning to "try to avoid having this public battle at the
expense of the children," a State Supreme Court hearing on several pretrial
motions turned remarkably nasty today, as Allen's and Farrow's lawyers
skirmished for two hours over sex, lies, videotape and money. Farrow did not
attend, but Allen watched pensively from the second row of spectator seats,
surrounded by several dozen reporters. He said afterward that if he had known
what would eventually result, "I would never have taken Mia to that first lunch
years ago."

When it was over, Allen's team had won access to what lawyer Harvey Sladkus
called "the now-famous videotape" in which Allen's adopted 7-year-old daughter,
Dylan, is said to make accusations of sexual abuse. Allen will be allowed to
send birthday and holiday gifts to his children (his biological son, Satchel,
turns 5 next week), but acting Justice Elliott Wilk ruled that he must avoid
contact with Dylan's school and receive reports of her progress through Farrow's
attorneys.

More significantly, Allen's lawyers argued successfully against a motion to stay
the custody proceedings while Farrow's attempt to nullify Allen's adoption of
Dylan and 14-year-old Moses is being heard in Manhattan Surrogate Court. Sladkus
said that would result in "months and months and months of deprivation of
parental rights," part of Farrow's "systematically and intentionally trying to
drive a wedge between a father and three children."

But Farrow's lawyer, Eleanor Alter, fought off attempts to have additional
guardians appointed for each of the three children (since the Surrogate Court
has already appointed them for Moses and Dylan) and to have a particular family
therapist begin treating Dylan, who is regularly seeing a team at Yale-New Haven
Medical Center.

Such a decision should be made by the custodial parent, the judge noted. While
the court had yet to decide who that would be, he said, "it is clear to me that
Mia Farrow has been acting in that capacity to date. I don't believe it is
appropriate for Mr. Allen or for me to dictate the medical treatment that is
appropriate for Dylan."

The money issues, including Allen's attempt to subpoena Farrow's recently
disclosed publishing contract for her autobiography (Doubleday is said to be
paying $ 3 million), were deferred.

It was not pretty.

His lawyers charged that "these children are living in a dangerous situation";
labeled the fact that 14-year-old Moses Farrow has given a press interview
"child abuse"; and pointed out that Mia Farrow's estimated net worth, according
to documents she filed, is $ 3.8 million. Thus, faced with her application for $
300,000 from Allen to pay legal fees, "a word came to me that I thought was
appropriate," said Sladkus. "Chutzpah ... sheer and unadulterated nerve and
gall."

Not to be outdone, Alter promised to produce hotel and phone records showing
that as Allen was embarking on his affair with Farrow's adopted daughter
Soon-Yi, "he was having a sexual relationship" with Farrow as well. This
evidence would contradict Allen's statements that he and Farrow had not been
lovers for years and would constitute "a fraud on the Surrogate Court," leading
to the adoptions' being overturned, Alter claimed.

And by the way, Allen's net worth is in the neighborhood of $ 20 million, if the
documents he filed are to be believed, which they emphatically are not by
Farrow's legal team.

And furthermore, though Farrow does not object to Allen's sending gifts, Alter
did want the court to know that the last time he sent presents to Dylan, "she
locked herself in her room and refused to open them."

As though their clients' passions were contagious, the lawyers in the case
appear to have taken a strong dislike to one another. Sladkus called Alter's
statements about Allen and Farrow's sexual relationship "inflammatory and
false." Alter took exception to her opponent's use of the term "the Allen
children," noting with clenched jaw that "there are no Allen children. Their
names are Farrow, every single one of them." Sladkus remarked in passing that
Alter will no longer take his phone calls; they communicate by fax.

Alter declined to play "Meet the Press" afterward, saying that her client felt
that "the resolution of all these issues should be in the court and not in the
media."

But Allen, when the hearing had ended, held an impromptu press conference before
a thicket of microphones and cameras -- Wilk has barred them from the courtroom
-- set up in the courthouse rotunda. "If I got nothing out of this except the
fact that I could give my children Christmas and birthday presents, I'm
thrilled," he said.

But of course, he had gotten much more -- namely, the fact that his attempt to
win custody will proceed. He has not seen Dylan or Satchel since August, he
said, and his visits with Moses were "peremptorily cut off" by Farrow before
Thanksgiving. He's worried that "a certain amount of brainwashing" may be taking
place in the big apartment on the other side of Central Park, where his children
and several others reside with the woman he used to love.

Alter posts first varsity win, over Springboro;
Beavercreek wins first Frozen Creek title

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi mgokavi@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 408 words


All five local high school hockey teams can take something from the season's
first weekend.

* For Alter, it was a weekend of firsts. The infant varsity team lost its first
three but did get its first victory. The Knights lost to Beavercreek (9-3),
Oregon Clay (7-3) and Toledo Whitmer (7-1). But in the final game of the Frozen
Creek event, Alter stopped Springboro 6-4. Jay Morgan led the Knights with three
goals and two assists while goalie Brian Klueber made 30 saves.

"The team is learning to play at the varsity level," Alter coach Jack Collins
said. "I can live with the mistakes, but not lack of effort. Not one time during
any of the four games did I feel that the team gave up.

"Yes, it was very important for the team to get their first victory and gain
some confidence."

The Knights play Cincinnati St. Xavier at 4 p.m. Sunday at South Metro.

* Beavercreek won its first Frozen Creek title in nine attempts, going 3-0-1.
The Beavers play Oxford Talawanda at 5: 10 p.m. Saturday at the Kettering Rec
Center.

* Troy went 2-2 at the Frozen Creek, beating Whitmer and Springboro. Goaltender
Fred Edwards played well in the wins, stopping 30 and 28 shots. The Trojans lost
a rematch to Whitmer, falling 3-1. Troy hosts Sycamore at 7 p.m. Sunday at
Hobart Arena.

* Springboro lost three games at Frozen Creek, but posted a 10-4 victory over
Oregon Clay. Coach Jack Hanson's team is capable of such scoring outbursts but
is searching for consistency.

Former Dayton Bombers Jamie Ling and Brian Ridolfi are in their first seasons as
assistant coaches with the Panthers. Springboro plays Toledo Central Catholic at
1:30 p.m. Sunday at Clauss Arena on the University of Findlay campus.

* For Centerville, maybe the best thing about the first weekend is that it's
behind the Elks. Facing a daunting schedule, Centerville went 0-3 at the Toledo
Cold Turkey event. The Elks lost to Sylvania Northview (8-0), Trinity (7-1) and
Mentor (3-1), getting outscored 18-2.

On the team's Web site, Centerville coach Andy Sloan was quoted as saying about
the Northview game, "We were totally dominated from the very first puck drop. We
played poorly and we coached poorly. It was a very disappointing game for
Centerville hockey."

The Elks will seek to rebound on the road this weekend. Centerville plays
Findlay at 7 p.m. Saturday in the Hancock Recreation Center and at 9 a.m. Sunday
against Perrysburg at the University of Findlay.

                             October 3, 2008 Friday

Boys to join Alter girls in Columbus;
The Knights shoot a 313, while C-J's Eagles finish second with a 318; both teams
are making repeat trips to state tournament.

BYLINE: Staff Report

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B5

The plans for a caravan to Columbus next Friday and Saturday, Oct. 10-11, were
already being formed in the early evening hours Thursday by the Alter High
School golf parents.

For the first time, the school will have two teams in the state Division II golf
tournaments at the Ohio State courses.

The boys, a fixture at state for over a decade, qualified again by winning the
Southwest District D-II championship at the Weatherwax course in West
Middletown. They shot 313, five shots better than Chamiande-Julienne at 318.
Both teams were at state last year. C-J was runner-up, while Alter was eighth.

The Alter girls qualified to state for the first time Wednesday by taking second
in the D-II district at Heatherwoode in Springboro with a score of 361.
Tippecanoe won the girls district at 353.

"It'll be fun having so many Alter people following the kids around the
courses," said Knights first-year boys coach John Sherman. "I'm sure the guys
would have really gotten a bad time at school if they hadn't made it to state
but the girls did.

"I was kind of worried when we were playing the back nine. The wind came up, and
we hit some bad shots. But we held on. John Muir really came through for us on
the back nine."

Sophomore Jon Neroni was low man for Alter and tournament medalist with a 74.
Muir, a senior, came in at 77; Andy Henehan, a junior, had a 79; and Greater
Catholic League North Division player of the year Jim Metter had an 83.

Zak Hadaway was C-J's low man at 75; Sam Jandel shot a 78; Penn Saad an 81; and
Christian Volk an 84.

Alter had a three-stroke lead, 155-158, after nine holes. On the back nine many
Alter shots became wayward, but Muir remained steady with a 36 after a 41 on the
front nine. Neroni came in at 37-37.

"What makes you a strong team is when different guys step up," Sherman said.

The top two individuals not from advancing teams also advance to state. In D-II
they were Alex Nikias at 76 and Ronnie Stump of Oakwood at 78. Oakwood was third
as a team at 332. Corey Weckerling and Daniel Willis followed Stump in scoring
at 84, while Patrick Meeks was at 86.

Division III boys

Middletown Christian will be making its first trip to state after winning the
team title with a 341. Cincinnati Summit Country Day earned the other state
berth at 344. Adam Taulbee was MC's low man at 79. Wes Drees of Versailles was
medalist at 76 and goes to state as an individual along with Carlton Zesch of
Cincinnati Seven Hills, who shot an 80.

Division I girls

Centerville was the easy team winner in the Dayton sectional on the Pipestone
course in Miamisburg.

The Elks came in with 346, while Fairborn was 31 strokes back at 377. Both teams
go the district Oct. 8 at Weatherwax, along with Northmont (383) and Beavercreek
(388).

Alee Everman (Centerville) and Allie Pulos (Northmont) tied for medalist honors
at 83. Four individuals from nonadvancing teams go to district. They are
Madeline Kaminski (85) and Micaela Cronin (Centerville, 860; Alexa Hetzler
(Greenville, 90) and Kellie Anderson (Stebbins, 93).

Knights shoot for state title;
Alter girls (24-3) will face Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown (22-4) - '07 state
runner-up - in Division II final.

COLUMBUS - Alter tries to play smothering defense no matter what.

But when the Knights girls basketball team hits a few shots, they get even
hungrier.

"When you start to get (ahead) and start to play your game, it helps your
defense so much," Alter senior Courtney Chihil said. "It gets you excited. It
makes you want to play defense even more."

The Knights broke open a tight Division II state semifinal game Thursday, March
6, with a 10-0 third-quarter run.

The 45-31 victory over Columbus Mifflin at the Schottenstein Center puts Alter
(24-3) into the state title game against Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown (22-4) at
10:45 a.m., Saturday.

Alter's girls are in the first state championship basketball finale in school
history.

"It's a great opportunity for our program, a wonderful opportunity for our
program," Alter coach Christina Hart said. "I'm happy for the kids."

After Mifflin tied the game at 26-26 early in the third quarter, Alter's 10-0
run changed the contest's complexion. Chihil, who led Alter with 18 points, hit
a 3-pointer. Mary Bruner scored from the right wing, Chihil cashed in from the
block and Nicole Christie drained a 3 for a 36-26 lead.

"We knocked in some shots, and we started making the game more of a fullcourt
game again, which is what we really wanted to do," Hart said. "I think that
settled us down in general."

Behind early hoops by Meghan Waterman (11 points), Alter had 7-0 and 10-2 leads.

But those evaporated when Mifflin adjusted to Alter's first defensive flurry.
Led by Amber Arter (eight points), the Punchers (20-5) took a 22-21 lead before
Alter's Ashley Christie hit three late free throws for a 24-22 halftime
advantage.

After three quarters, Alter led 38-28. The Knights' defense ultimately forced 26
Mifflin turnovers and held the Punchers to just nine second-half points - three
in the fourth quarter.

"We normally run against teams with great defense," said Mifflin coach Troy
Taylor, whose team had averaged 72 points. "I thought this team was a little bit
more composed. They stayed with their game plan, and they executed."

Alter had 19 steals, led by Ashley Christie's five. Arter and Mifflin's Jalyssa
Campbell each had six turnovers.

Alter faces a Hathaway Brown team that was the 2007 state runner-up. The Knights
hope the Blazers repeat that spot, with Alter winning its first title. "I'm sure
tomorrow it will be a different feeling," Chihil said. "But right now it's just
excitement."

Jandel tops fall Lamber winners

One week she's named Oakwood High School's homecoming queen, the next week she
becomes the first Oakwood girl to earn a state championship in golf.

Now one more honor for Emma Jandel: The Oakwood senior is one of the winners of
a Lamber Award for the fall sports season.

* Best Career (female): Oakwood's Emma Jandel polished off her outstanding
career by becoming the first Oakwood girl to win the state championship. She was
a captain of the talented boys team, then competed individually in the
postseason in the girls tournament. She'll play next year at Ohio State
University.

* Best Career (male): Alter High School's Paul Krebs has been a cross country
warrior for four years. One of the area's hardest working athletes compiled a
pair of runner-up finishes and a third-place finish at the state meet.

* Most Perfect: Kettering Fairmont High School posted its first unbeaten regular
season in boys soccer. The Firebirds were ranked sixth in the state.

* Most Dangerous: Lamar Skeeter, Fairmont's lightningquick striker scored in
nearly every game. His scoring ability allowed the Firebirds the luxury to adopt
a defensive mentality.

* Best Team (female): Oakwood captured its first Division II state team
championship in girls tennis after finishing runner-up last year.

The Jills, coached by Dave Hartsock, earned their third straight trip to the
Final Four.

Oakwood then sent singles player Kelsey Haviland and doubles players Cara Wald
and Kristin Cobb to the state tournament for individuals.

Runner-up: Alter's girls cross country team finished second in the state for the
second straight year.

* Most Welcome Return: Fairmont's field hockey team reached the state final for
the first time since 1997. The Firebirds fell to Columbus Watterson, 3-1, to
finish 15-5-1.

* Biggest Nemesis: Alter's volleyball team can answer this one. The talented
Knights reached the regional final before falling once again to unbeaten
Cincinnati Roger Bacon High School, the defending Division II state champion.

* Toughest Rematch: Alter's boys soccer handed Carroll High School its only
regular-season loss. They met again in the district final where the Patriots
blitzed Alter, 6-1.

* Toughest Shoes to Fill: Fairmont volleyball coach Bill Buirley must replace 11
seniors from his district finalist team, including first-team All-District 15
player Kelsey Rankin and Greater Western Ohio Conference Player of the Year
Stephani Bennett.

Buirley was District 15 and GWOC coach of the year.

* Toughest Loss: Oakwood boys soccer team dominated unbeaten Greeneview High
School in the Division III regional semifinals, but fell 2-1 in overtime.

The Lumberjacks were as hot as any area team in the postseason, outscoring
opponents 21-2 in the first three games.

* Most Misleading Record: Alter finished 11-9 in girls soccer, but was ranked
fourth in the state in Division II.

* Favorite Opponent: Fairmont running back Cameron Campeau rushed for 379 yards
on 41 carries in a win over Springfield North High School. Last year, he
exploded for 413 yards on 63 carries against the Panthers.

* Biggest Milestone: Alter boys soccer coach Bob Ellis notched his 200th victory
in his 22nd season.

* Longest Hitters: Alter's golf team is filled with 300-yard boomers.

* Most Familiar: Oakwood's Emma Jandel won the state golf championship, a feat
that coach Jen Lohmeyer had seen before. Her son, Steve, earned medalist honors
in the boys tournament in 1999.

Baltimore Jewish Times owner says it has found new investor group

BYLINE: Ben Mook

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 441  words


Alter Communications Inc., publisher of the Baltimore Jewish Times, is seeking a
second 30-day extension from the court in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, saying
that a group of new investors has entered the picture.

U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge James F. Schneider had given Alter and its former
long-time printer, H.G. Roebuck & Son Inc., until Nov. 25 to reach a compromise
after he denied both of their competing bankruptcy plans on Sept. 28. At issue
is the post-Chapter 11 restructuring plan for Alter, which initially filed for
bankruptcy protection in April 2010.

Alter said in a filing Wednesday that it needed the extra time to continue
negotiations with Roebuck. The company said since the last deadline a group of
investors from the community had approached Alter and agreed to help ensure it
continues publishing.

"On November 28, 2011, [Alter] and the investor group reached an agreement in
principle which, if approved by this Court, would provide for an infusion of
cash into the company, an effective means of implementing a reorganization and a
continuation of this treasured Baltimore institution," the motion reads.

Details on the makeup of the investor group were not included in the filing.
Alter attorney Maria Ellena Chavez-Ruark, with Tydings & Rosenberg LLP in
Baltimore, said the details would follow.

Ruark said Friday that negotiations with Roebuck were continuing and that she
was optimistic an agreement could be reached.

"We're hopeful that this will allow us to take it to the next step," she said.

H.G. Roebuck sued Alter and Jewish Times publisher Andrew A. Buerger for breach
of contract in 2009 and won a $362,000 judgment. This led to Alter filing for
bankruptcy protection and Roebuck's owner challenged the initial plan, which
would have given them 85 percent of Alter's profits over a five-year period.
Roebuck's competing plan would have split Alter's stock evenly with the Buerger
family.

In addition to the Jewish Times, Alter publishes Style magazine, Chesapeake Life
magazine and a portfolio of custom publications. The Jewish Times, Maryland's
largest Jewish weekly publication, publishes on Fridays, averages more than 120
pages and has a paid circulation of nearly 50,000, according to its website.

The paper was founded in 1919 by David Alter, and current publisher Andrew
Buerger took over the company when his father, Charles A. Buerger, died in 1996.
Andrew Buerger changed the company name from Jewish Times Inc. to Alter
Communications.

Buerger did not return calls for comment. Roebucks' attorney, William L. Hallam
of Rosenberg | Martin | Greenberg LLP also did not return calls for comment last
week.

   Alter High School offers a unique cultural experience to students in the form
of a student exchange. Every year in October, students from Neils Steensen
Gymnasium, the only Catholic school in the Nordic countries, attend Alter for
approximately three weeks. These students from Copenhagen, Denmark are placed
with an Alter host student and their families for the duration of their stay in
the United States. These students are able to share common experiences and
explore their cultural differences.  Alter is currently working with the
administration of NSG to establish the first return trip of our students to NSG!
We are working toward scheduling a trip to Copenhagen in Spring 2010. Our goal
is to provide Alter students with a combined educational and cultural exchange
unlike anything they have experienced before.  Alter students also have the
opportunity to experience life in foreign countries on other sponsored trips.
Alter students have recently been spotted traveling throughout Guatemala, Spain,
France, Italy, Romania and Germany.  Please turn on JavaScript in your web

People in Business: UP CLOSE / GREGG METCALF, vice president Alter Group,
Atlanta ;
Turf wars;
Broker leases commercial space, looks for land to develop; competition with
neighboring states makes job tougher

BYLINE: KEVIN DUFFY; Staff

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 1017 words


Much has been made about residential real estate tanking, but what about office
and industrial?

Gregg Metcalf leases office and industrial space in suburban Atlanta and
elsewhere in the Southeast, and searches for land that his employer, the Alter
Group, can buy and develop.

A privately-held company based in Skokie, Ill., the Alter Group owns Brookside
Concourse in Alpharetta and Chattahoochee Corners in Duluth.

Overdevelopment, corporate wariness and high land prices have hurt business. But
those challenges are forcing adjustments that will result in more thoughtful
projects, he said.

Metcalf also shares his thoughts on economic development and the state's Open
Records Act.

Q: Is it harder to do leases now in metro Atlanta with the economy in such poor
shape?

A: It's slower to do deals. I'm in a long, long negotiation with a tenant right
now for a renewal and expansion, and it's like pulling teeth. I think it's a lot
of anticipation because of the election. Everybody wants to wait and see who's
going into the Senate, who's going into the House and who's going into the
executive role. It becomes business as usual after.

Q: What about finding land?

A: We went through a cycle where land got so expensive because residential guys
drove the cost up. Finally, the landowners are getting realistic and reducing
their price. Or, unfortunately for some of those residential developers, that
land is going back to the bank, and we're going to see an opportunity to pick up
some dirt.

Q: Are gas prices hurting your business?

A: Gas prices will change our business. Atlanta is the only city I know of where
someone will walk a full block to get into their car to drive a block. You can
still build a traditional office park if it's driven by a tenant that wants that
environment and it's what I consider a campus-type environment. But I don't
believe you should develop any kind of office without mixed-use completely in
your mind.

Q: Are many companies looking for industrial and office space?

A: We haven't had the UPSes, the major corporate moves we've had in the past.
Having land in South Florida, Atlanta and Chicago, I witnessed a process of one
company choosing between the three, and they chose the most expensive in South
Florida, and it was driven mostly by incentives. I had a great building here in
Atlanta. It was the least expensive. Yet they still went to South Florida.

Q: Why Florida?

A: The feedback I got was the young employee base there. Here in Atlanta they
were looking at suburban. In South Florida they were also looking at suburban.
One of the comments was, "Well, a lot of the young technological population in
Atlanta is in Midtown." We were getting that same [Midtown] demographic in South
Florida when we were looking in suburban.

Q: Does the state do a good a job attracting companies?

A: Our economic development folks do a spectacular job in Georgia just like they
do in Florida, just like they do in Tennessee. But one thing I'd like to see is
a little more executive support for our economic development people.

The head of real estate for Kaplan [University] --- I was playing golf with him
many years ago and he received a phone call and it was the governor of Florida
[Jeb Bush], just to say, "We really would like to see you come to our state.
Here's the number to my office. Anything we can do to help."

I would bet that our governor makes that phone call, but he probably makes it
only to the CEO or the chairman. The influence there is going to be the real
estate guy when it's a big company like that. It would be nice to hear a story
like that happening in the metro Atlanta area.

Q: What could the state's economic development department do differently to help
commercial real estate?

A: In North Carolina, Tennessee, as well as Florida, it seems like those states
have bigger budgets. A lot of what happens in Atlanta, and in Georgia as a
whole, is driven by private enterprise as opposed to state funding. I don't know
if that's a leadership thing or a legislative thing or where that comes from.
Should states infuse taxpayer dollars into these projects? That's a political
thing. The reality is that it works. It becomes political when the dollars reach
a certain point. We are competing with other states. And if the other states
have the bigger budget, they're going to beat us.

Q: Are there additional incentives the state could offer?

A: It's different for every company. Whether it be training, tax credits, cash.
State of Florida, for example, can write a check to a tenant. Just write a
check, cash money. Now, there are lots of strings attached to that check. You
need to provide X amount of jobs for X amount of years. We're a little more
conservative than Florida. I don't think Georgia writes checks. Which is
probably not a bad thing.

Sometimes a project may come into the market and our executive level may
champion that project and it gets a lot of attention and it gets pushed through.
Then sometimes another project may come through --- and I don't know if it has
to do with the weather or what it is --- it just gets overlooked and it goes
somewhere else.

Q: How has the Open Records Act affected economic development?

A: In Georgia, not good because other states don't have it. There are economic
development people in Tennessee that, if we have any kind of an offering to a
company to incentivize them to come, they can see that offering, turn right back
around and up the ante. We can't see what they're offering. It's very
uncompetitive negotiations. The Open Records Act is a wise thing overall, but it
does have a negative impact on economic development.

Coach's finale a defeat for Alter;
Columbus Watterson prevails in semifinals, finishes Knights' run.;
HIGH SCHOOLSBOYS BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 392 words


Joe Petrocelli saluted fans as he coached his final game after 49 varsity
seasons and one JV with the Knights.

COLUMBUS - Fingers crossed, Alter was geared up for one unlikely final push
through the boys high school state tournament to send beloved coach Joe
Petrocelli out a winner.

Columbus Watterson just said no.

"We've had days like this, but this is the wrong day to have it," sighed Alter
senior Jaaron Simmons following a deflating 53-42 setback to Watterson in the
Division II state semifinals Thursday night before a crowd of 11,295.

Watterson (27-1) advances to Saturday's D-II final against Akron St. Vincent St.
Mary, which defeated Vincent Warren in Thursday's other D-II semi, 70-51.

Like Simmons said, everything that had worked so well for Alter (21-6) in five
previous unforeseen tourney wins was missing at Ohio State University's
Schottenstein Center. The Knights couldn't shoot straight (3 of 18 in treys),
couldn't rebound (out-boarded 32-24) and couldn't defend when it mattered most.
Turnovers at key times also were an issue.

None of that was a factor in upset wins over Trotwood-Madison, No. 1 Thurgood
Marshall and defending state champ Dunbar in a regional final. Against
Watterson, it was a season ender.

Simmons, all but unstoppable offensively in the tourney run, led the Knights
with 17 points. But he didn't score any field goals in the first and fourth
quarters.

Still, Alter was within three when he hit two free throws with 6:18 left in the
game. Watterson, ranked No. 2 in the state, responded with a game-ending 14-6
run.

Michael Spencer, Michael Schwieterman and Dean Lemon all had six points for
Alter.

Alter had no answer for 6-foot-5 Matt Hughes. He scored most of his 21 points
around the bucket and collected 10 rebounds and three blocks. Watterson's Matt
Lehmann hit six of eight shots and added 14 points.

Alter's sizeable student section chanted "thank you, Petro" as the final minute
ticked off. He saluted back.

"I've been preparing for it for the last six or seven games," reflected
Petrocelli on his final game after 49 varsity seasons and one JV with the
Knights. "Every game was the last game, the last practice.

"We weren't supposed to do anything. ... It's come to an end. If it's going to
end anywhere, better out here. It's a great place to be. There's nothing more
exciting than a basketball state championship."

your job? Witnessing when the eyes and minds of students and teachers are opened
to the impact of STEMM inside and outside the classroom. What volunteer work are
you involved in? I coordinate the Toys for God's Kids chapter at CJ. I learned
about the program from a local retired engineer and saw it as an opportunity to
get the CJ community involved in an ongoing service project related to STEMM. I
also serve as a volunteer baker for Hospice of Dayton, and a lector at St.
Albert the Great church. What makes you the most proud to be a part of the
Dayton community? This region is a rich one for STEMM education, and CJ is at
the forefront and a leader in that effort. We have put CJ STEMM out there in the
community to provide student volunteers, exhibits and learning opportunities for
children and families beyond our own, and the community embraces us.

What makes CJ STEMM unique?

Because the program is offered as part of the Catholic educational experience at
CJ, STEMM learning and teaching is naturally integrated with the important
element of faith, service and ministry, and is in partnership with individuals
and organizations who intentionally make their faith an important part of STEMM
work and careers.

What do you enjoy beyond STEMM?

Despite the fact that STEMM - Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and
Medicine - can be found all around us in everyday life, I enjoy life outside of
CJ STEMM, keeping up with kids and family, reading books and patronizing our
public library, baking sweet treats and listening to music while doing so.

GOODYEAR TO CUT 800 IN CANADA

SECTION: BUSINESS; MARKET MEMO; Pg. D7

LENGTH: 592 words


Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., pressing a cost-cutting drive, said it would reach a
2008 goal early by halting tire production at its Valleyfield, Quebec, plant and
trimming the work force there from 1,000 to 200 by June 30.

The Akron, Ohio-based tiremaker, which settled new contracts with Canadian and
U.S. workers just last week, already has announced closures of tire plants in
Britain, New Zealand and Texas.

In another staff-cutting move, the contract approved by strikers last week
includes buyout offers equal to $2,000 for each year of service for more than
400 employees, including 29 at its plant in Sun Prairie, according to a union
summary. The buyouts would be a minimum of $8,000 and maximum of $40,000.

St. Louis recycler buys state firm

St. Louis-based Alter Trading Corp. announced that it has acquired
Wisconsin-based Samuels Recycling Co. in a deal involving scrap metal
processors. Terms were not disclosed.

Samuels, which has about 250 employees, was founded in Portage in 1896 and has
facilities there, at 4400 Sycamore Ave. on Madison's east side, and in
Janesville, Green Bay, Waupun, Waupaca, and Beaver Dam.

Privately held Alter, which has about 550 employees, said the purchase of
Samuels will make it one of the largest scrap metal recycling companies in the
country. With the acquisition, Alter will operate 28 metal recycling facilities
and five trading offices in seven states as well as a representative sales
office in Shanghai, China.

Court affirms Innogenetics' win

A federal judge has upheld a $7 million damage verdict against Abbott
Laboratories for infringing a patent of Innogenetics, a Belgian biotech with an
office in Madison.

Judge Barbara Crabb of the Western District of Wisconsin also rejected Abbott's
requests for a new trial on infringement and validity. She set an evidentiary
hearing for next Thursday to consider the company's request for a permanent
injunction against Abbott's sale of infringing products.

The litigation began in September 2005 when Innogenetics sued Abbott alleging
that Abbott was infringing the company's U.S. patent covering a method of
genotyping the Hepatitis C Virus. Companies such as Bayer, Roche, and
Madison-based Third Wave Technologies have licensed the patent.

Crabb did vacate the jury's determination that Abbott willfully infringed
Innogenetics' patent, and she also declined an Innogenetics motion for enhanced
damages or attorneys fees.

Abbott said it plans to appeal.

BRIEFLY

Milwaukee-based design firm Kahler Slater, which also has an office at 110 King
St. in Madison, announced that it has acquired Performa Higher Education, a
national consulting and design group specializing in work for small private
colleges and universities. Terms were not disclosed. Performa's offices in Green
Bay and Burlington, N.C., will remain open. Kahler Slater focuses on the design
of health sciences and dental facilities at prominent universities.

Tammy Stawicki of Portage has opened a franchise office of Brooke Insurance.

QB Hayes is perfect fit for offense;
Knights senior runs his undefeated team's option with precision.;
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ALTER

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 598 words


Alter quarterback Dusty Hayes is closing in on 2,000 yards rushing in the
Knights' ground-oriented offense, and coach Ed Domsitz says Hayes' passing has
improved.

Alter quarterback Dusty Hayes needs one more big effort for the Knights to win a
state title.

Dusty Hayes has committed to Notre Dame, where he'll likely move to defensive
back.

Big and physical linemen and sideline-to-sideline linebackers have always been a
given during Alter's incredible high school football run the past two decades.
And so too has been its quarterbacks.

The Knights lean heavily on the veer option, which had its heyday in the 1970s
and '80s. It's a run-oriented off ense that relies on the quarterback making
multiple quick decisions on whether to hand off to the fullback, keep it or
pitch to a running back around the edge on every play.

And no one has done that better at Alter than senior Dusty Hayes.

"Dusty Hayes is throwing the ball better this year than he did a year ago,"
Alter coach Ed Domsitz said this week. "We do run the ball quite a bit, and he's
an exceptional runner. He's got quickness, strength and he's one of the best
competitors I've ever coached."

He's also a key reason why Alter (14-0) will play for a Division IV state
championship at 10 a.m. today at Ohio Stadium in Columbus. Waiting for Alter is
Cleveland Benedictine (13-1), a private school that also has a rich history of
football success.

At 5-foot-11 and 190 pounds, Hayes is unassuming. But that all changes once he
takes a snap.

Like many great veer quarterbacks, he's more a running back who lines up behind
the center. He often keeps the ball after an initial fake and dashes through
openings between the line and near corner.

When teams commit to stopping Hayes, he'll hand off to senior fullback Tom Alig
or pitch to senior running back Nick Coleman. The results have been impressive
and unstoppable.

Hayes is nearing 2,000 yards rushing. He went for 389 and six touchdowns in a
Week 10 defeat of rival Chaminade Julienne. Coleman is nearing 1,500 yards
rushing and 20 scores. He's verbally committed to Notre Dame, where he'll likely
play defensive back. Alig and Andrew Eisenhauer, also seniors, have combined for
close to another 1,000 yards rushing. If Alter is to add its third state
championship to its 2008-09 title teams, it'll need more of the same offensive
production that has been its staple all season.

Benedictine has won six state championships, the last in 2003-04. Linebacker
Jerome Baker is verbally committed to Ohio State.

And like Alter, Benedictine also has an offense that has operated in high gear.

"I'm not sure there's any way you can totally stop what they do," Domsitz said.
"You know they're going to pick up yards and hurt you offensively.

"You've got to try and contain them and be in a situation where they don't get
up by a lot of points. We've got to keep them from killing us. We know they're
going to do some damage."

Alter joins Wayne (D-I) and Midwest Athletic Conference members Coldwater (D-V),
Minster (D-VI) and Marion Local (D-VII) as area teams playing for state titles.
The games return to Ohio State after a 24-year run at Canton and Massillon.

"These last four (playoff ) weeks have been a great ride for the kids," Domsitz
said. "Our parents get into it. They're all wound up. It's a real special kind
of feeling. It's big each time.

"Someone asked me which year was the biggest thrill. It's something special
every year because it's something you know is not going to happen every year."

Walker lifts CJ past Alter;
UConn recruit scores 20 points, including clutch free throw as Eagles win battle
of area powerhouses.

BYLINE: By Matt O'Donnell Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 388 words


KETTERING - When her team needed her most, Samarie Walker showed why she is a
top recruit.

With less than 15 seconds to play and the Eagles leading Alter 47-45, the
Chaminade Julienne star and University of Connecticut recruit skied high for a
rebound and was fouled.

After missing the first shot, Walker wasn't fazed and calmly knocked down the
second free throw to give the Eagles a three-point lead.

"I started talking to myself to build confidence," said Walker, who scored a
game-high 20 points while grabbing 11 rebounds. "I knew I was going to hit the
second one."

The Knights' Courtney Christie then drove the lane and made a layup with less
than five seconds to go.

But with Alter having no timeouts left, Walker took the ball from the referee
and just held on to let the remaining three seconds tick off to secure a 48-47
win at Alter Monday, Dec. 15.

"I'm most proud of Samarie for not taking the ball out of bounds," coach Marc
Greenberg said. "She's one of the smartest players we've had.

"A lot of people look at her physical talent and don't know her basketball IQ
and don't know how high it really is."

After a dismal first half by Alter, in which they scored just 10 points, the
Knights showed why they were picked as the No.1 Div. II school in the Dayton
Daily News poll.

Trailing 32-19 after three periods, Alter (4-1) used a 14-3 rally in the fourth
to close within five of the Eagles (4-1), who were the No.1 Div. I school in the
poll.

But Chaminade Julienne's Emily Michael, who was second on the team with 13
points, hit a 3-pointer to give the Eagles breathing room.

The Knights continued to fight back, however.

Ashley Christie, who finished with 10 points, hit a big 3-pointer and the
Knights were within four with 1:39 to play.

But once again, CJ answered it, this time with a two-pointer by Simmone Gage to
push the lead back out to six.

"There's a lot of internal fortitude on our kids' part," Greenberg said. "It
shows a lot of guts to gut out that fourth quarter."

Alter's Whitney Dabbelt, who also scored 10, went to the line with a chance to
tie the game with 15.8 seconds to play, but she missed both, which led to
Walker's game-winning free throw.

"It was crazy," Walker said of the win. "In the fourth quarter when they started
coming back we got down mentally, but after awhile we picked each other back
up."

Maryland Judges Use Alter Egos To Improve Performance

SECTION: CORPORATE COUNSEL ORGANIZATION HIGHLIGHTS ATLANTIC; Pg. 555

LENGTH: 996 words

HIGHLIGHT: This article was submitted by Eric Low, director of library services
for the National Center for State Courts for inclusion in and is reprinted by
permission of Center Court, Volume 2, Number 3, Summer 1997.


The National Center's Library and Information Service have received a number of
requests from court officials for information about "judicial ombudsman"
programs.  This interest seems to stem from two sources: the need to deflect
criticism of sitting judges and the need to improve customer services and
satisfaction with the administration of justice. Both motives speak to a growing
realization that courts cannot provide justice effectively if they are removed
from the larger communities they serve.

On the one hand, the desire to protect judges from unjust criticism may lead to
tactics that are defensive in nature. (See Colleen P. Danos, ''Responding to the
Unwarranted Criticism of Judges," NCSC Information Service Memorandum No. IS
97.0693 [May 19, 1997].) On the other hand, the desire to strengthen customer
services may foster a proactive approach, such as the establishment of a
citizen's advisor or ombudsman program.  One of the recommendations of Jona
Goldschmidt and Ira Pilchen in their manual User-Friendly Justice (American
Judicature Society, 1996) is for courts to "consider designating a staff person
or volunteer as ombudsman, a person court visitors can contact if they have a
grievance with the service they receive" (at 13).

Despite the growing interest in judicial ombudsmen, very few programs exist, and
most are in the early stages of development. While some programs are directed
toward the general public, several address the relationship between the bench
and the bar.

The New Jersey courts have created an ombudsman system that envisions an
ombudsman in each county or vicinage to handle "complaints from lawyers
concerning matters which affect the bench and bar that do not fall within the
purview of the ethics system or that should remain anonymous." (See "N.J.
Creates Ombudsmen to Deal with Judges," Bar Leaders 6 [March/April 1994].) The
system employs retired judges or respected members of the local bar who serve
voluntarily.  The ombudsmen handle issues regarding a judges' demeanor rather
than possible ethical violations, and they do not interfere with the functions
of local bench/bar committees. (For a brief review of bench/bar committees, see
the winter 1997 issue of Center Court.) The program has been instituted in
several counties, including Camden and Passaic, and has been endorsed by the New
Jersey Supreme Court. (For current information on the New Jersey judicial
ombudsman program, contact Jeanette King of the New Jersey Administrative Office
of the Courts Minorities Concerns Department at [609] 984-0784.)

Courts in several Maryland counties have addressed bench/bar relations in a more
personal way. Rather than instituting a countywide judicial ombudsman to act as
a go-between for each local bench and bar, the courts in Montgomery and Prince
George's counties have developed a program that pairs a sitting judge with a
single member of the bar who serves as the judge's "alter ego."

Just about a year ago, the circuit, district, masters of domestic relations
causes and juvenile causes, and orphans court judges unanimously approved the
idea of establishing an alter ego program in the Prince George's County courts
under which sensitive information concerning a judge's relations with members of
the bar could be communicated to the judge in a confidential and nonthreatening
manner. Each judge has a member of the county bar who serves as his or her alter
ego. The alter ego program is voluntary, but it enjoys a remarkable 100 percent
participation by members of the judiciary.

Members of the bar who serve as alter egos are generally former partners in law
practice, close personal friends, or colleagues who are close to a judge on
either a professional or personal level. Communication of criticisms and
suggestions for improved relations with particular attorneys (whose identities
remain anonymous) or members of the bar in general are confidential and
off-the-record. The informality of the alter ego program guarantees anonymity
for the attorney who has a complaint against a sitting judge and confidentiality
for the judge whose conduct is in question. No records are kept, so nothing that
transpires between a judge and his or her alter ego can become part of a
subsequent disciplinary action. Although the program does not deal with ethical
violations, it does deal with the everyday tensions that arise in the courthouse
and the types of behavior by judges that make lawyers' lives miserable.

Prince George's County's alter ego program, which is one activity of the
Achieving Court Excellence (ACE) Committee, is modeled after a similar program
in Montgomery County. The Honorable William D. Missouri, county administrative
judge, Prince George's County Circuit Court and the 7th Judicial Circuit, was
looking for a mechanism to ease conflicts between members of the bench and bar
and decided to draw upon the successful experience of the program in neighboring
Montgomery County. Because no records are kept, it is difficult to know how well
the program is working in practice, but members of the bar are using this novel
method of making judges aware of their foibles, and lawyers who have worked with
judges' alter egos have been satisfied with the results.

Judge Missouri recently met with his own alter ego and conversed with him about
ways to improve his own courtroom demeanor. This was a routine meeting and was
not instigated by a complaint from a member of the bar.

For more information on the Prince George's County Alter Ego program, contact
the Honorable William D. Missouri, County Administrative Judge, Prince George's
County Circuit Court, 7th Judicial Circuit, Courthouse, Upper Marlboro, MD
20772. For information about the alter ego program in Montgomery County, contact
the Honorable Paul H. Weinstein, County Administrative Judge, Montgomery County
Circuit Court and the 6th Judicial Circuit, Judicial Center, 50 Courthouse
Square Rockville, MD 20850.

Alter, Springboro net top sectional seeds;
Clash of unbeatens? Knights would meet Tipp in regional final.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Greg Billing

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 509 words


Alter and Springboro are in different divisions and can't meet in the state
tournament, but Alter gave Springboro its only loss. Above: Jordan Diehl drives
past Alter's Braxtin Miller.

TROY - In the days leading up to the girls basketball sectional tournament draw,
Alter coach Chris Hart kept in contact with Tippecanoe coach Ian Porto. The
Knights and Red Devils - ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in the Division
II state poll - wanted to make sure they didn't run into each other any sooner
than necessary.

So, when would the marquee matchup happen should both keep winning?

"I know who our first-round opponent is. That's where we are right now," Hart
said Sunday with a slight smile and diplomatic answer.

Hart, whose team opens against Stivers next week, doesn't want to look ahead.
But she realizes high school girls basketball fans do.

If both win out, Alter (21-0) would play Tipp (21-0) in the regional final in
Springfield on March 13. But as both coaches know, a lot of basketball remains
to be played between now and then.

Alter - which lost in the D-II state title game last season - is the top seed in
the Lebanon upper bracket sectional. Tipp is the top seed in the Tecumseh upper
bracket. When Porto picked the Red Devils' spot on the bracket, No. 2 Kenton
Ridge, No. 3 Eaton and No. 4 Carroll all jumped to the bottom bracket.

"I even thought (No. 5) Meadowdale might come down," Kenton Ridge coach Ed Foulk
said. "It's about as good of a draw as you're going to get. When you're the No.
1 seed, people stay way."

In Division I, Springboro (18-1) was voted No. 1 in the 20-team super draw with
host sites at Troy and Wayne high schools. Coach Tom Benjamin put his Panthers
in the Dayton 1 bracket at Wayne.

"We're happy to be the No. 1 seed. You never know what other people perceive you
to be," Benjamin said. "We'll take the No. 1 seed and be happy about that. Now
you just have to go and play."

Springboro, which opens with No. 19 Xenia (5-15), has a potential sectional
final matchup with No. 4 Fairmont (12-7) if the seeds hold.

"That would appear to be the way it'll go. That's a heck of a sectional final,"
Benjamin said. "That's a district game in the sectional final, and that's if
everything holds up."

Centerville (17-3), Sidney (19-1), Fairmont and Beavercreek (13-6) followed
Springboro in the seedings.

"Kudos to coach Benjamin, he's done a terrific job. They've had a tremendous
season and they deserve the No. 1 seed," Centerville coach Adam Priefer said.
"We have talked and both teams respect the heck out of each other. We'd love to
play them in the regionals at some point, but that's everyone's goal."

Elsewhere in the draw:

Division III: Versailles (16-4) took the No. 1 seed in the Tippecanoe sectional,
beating out Anna (13-7) for the top spot.

Division IV: One of the best sectional finals (if the seeds hold) will take
place in the Brookville bracket. No. 1 Tri-Village (19-1) and No. 2 Miami Valley
(18-2) would meet for the sectional title Feb. 28.

take on Sugarcreek Garaway at 5:15 p.m.

COLUMBUS - Finally, the finals are here.

After more than one foot of snow and two days of waiting, the Alter Knights and
Versailles Tigers - and the rest of the state championship hopefuls - get their
shot. The state girls basketball finals take place today, March 10, at Ohio
State's Schottenstein Center.

Alter (24-3) gets things started against Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown (22-4) in
the Division II final at 10:45 a.m. Versailles (27-0) attempts to cap a perfect
season against Sugarcreek Garaway (25-2) in the D-III final at 5:15 p.m.

"Being here last year we kind of got a taste of it," said Versailles senior post
and University of Dayton recruit Justine Raterman. "Coming into this year, we
weren't going to settle. Last year we were just excited to get here. This year
we wanted so much more. We weren't going to back down in our first game."

Those state semifinal games seem so long ago. Alter last played on Thursday,
March 6, Versailles on Friday, March 7.

The Knights, making their first state final appearance in two trips to Columbus,
face a tall order with Hathaway Brown. Five Blazers are 6-foot-1 or taller. The
Knights have just one player taller than 5-11.

"We're not going to win the boards, but we have to compete," said Alter co-coach
Kendal Peck following Thursday's semifinal win over Columbus Mifflin, where the
Knights were outrebounded 24-22. "We can win if we can do that. But if its 44-20
we have no shot. We're not going to make 14 3-pointers like Lima Bath."

Versailles, meanwhile, hopes to exploit Raterman's 6-1 height advantage inside.
She grabbed a D-III semifinal record 19 rebounds on Thursday. Garaway has no one
taller than 5-11. The Tigers also go for their first state title in four
appearances.

G I R L S P R E V I E W S

Alter (24-3) vs. Hathaway Brown (22-4)

When: 10:45 a.m. today, March 10

Where: OSU's Schottenstein Center

Summary: What can Brown do for you? Rebound. The Blazers enter the Division II
final with an advantage down low with starters Angela Groves and Alison Nahra at
6-foot-1 and 6-2. They combined for 23 of Brown's 46 rebounds in a 68-58
semifinal win over Lima Bath. Alter, though, has been lights out with good
Knight defense. Alter has held its last 10 opponents to 38 points or less. Brown
has been held to less than 41 just once. Alter goes for its first state title in
two trips. Brown returns for its second trip after falling 45-26 to Warsaw River
View in the 2007 title game.

Versailles (27-0) vs. Sugarcreek Garaway (25-2)

When: 5:15 p.m. today

Where: OSU's Schottenstein Center

Summary: Versailles, which has been ranked No. 1 in every state poll, can make
it official with the Midwest Athletic Conference's 10th state title. Justine
Raterman - coming off a 27-point and 19-rebound effort in the semis - nearly
outrebounded Garaway (23 rebounds in the semis). Raterman and fellow senior
Emily Bohman are tough to stop. They combined for 54 points in Versailles' 75-60
semifinal win over Regina. Garaway, which only has losses to Berlin Hiland and
Orrville, allows just 23.8 points per game. It held Mt. Blanchard Riverdale
close to that in a 45-28 semifinal win.

Alter inducts 4 into athletic hall of fame

LENGTH: 525 words


KETTERING - Humbling, exciting, surprising and validating - there were as many
emotions as there were recipients when the 2010 class of the Alter High School
Athletic Hall of Fame was inducted.

Four inductees, John Crotty, Christina Hart, Mike Rose and Brandi Kohnle
Schuermann, were recognized in a ceremony Jan. 28. The honorees had a chance to
speak to Alter students the following day about the valuable lessons they
learned on the playing field.

Chris Hart, '80

Hart is a Hall of Famer who walks the halls of Alter daily. The eight-time
letter winner is both the athletic director and girls basketball coach.

"It's overwhelming and amazing," Hart said. "For a lot of people who are here
every day, I'm a name they can put a face to, so it's been an interesting
feeling being recognized this way."

She lettered in basketball, volleyball, softball and track. After averaging 15
points and 10 steals during her senior season, Hart went on to play at Xavier
where she was a four-year letter winner.

"Going into the hall of fame means a lot but having all of my varsity players
attend the banquet, I really can't put into words how special that was," she
said. "And being inducted with my friend (Lori Dorn) means so much."

Dorn, '79, was inducted into Alter's Distinguished Hall of Fame.

Mike Rose, '96

Rose was drafted by the Tampa Bay Rays but went to Purdue to play football and
baseball.

"Now, when I talk to young athletes, I talk about the importance of being
focused," Rose said. "I talk about good and great and what it takes to be the
best. You need to focus on whatever you do best and seize every opportunity."

Rose excelled at both sports, earning local and state recognition.

"I had a better baseball career but I just always loved football," he said.
"And, in the end, I was spreading myself pretty thin.

"I believe things happen for a reason and I have a life I love very much," he
said. "And I feel like if one kid listens to what I have to say, I've done my
job."

Brandi Kohnle Schuermann, '90

"Tennis was such a sacrifice timewise, over the years, that I know I missed out
on other things," Schuermann said. "This makes you feel like all the time and
effort was worth it."

Schuermann, Brandi Kohnle in high school, was a nationally ranked junior player
from the time she was 12 years old. She won the state singles tennis
championship as a senior and received the Rae Burick Women in Sports Award.

She was the first nationally ranked tennis player in Cincinnati Bearcats
history. Ranked as high as No. 42, she was ranked 77th nationally when she
graduated.

Tennis is still part of daily life for this mother of three. Schuermann is a
tennis instructor and the USTA Cincinnati adult league coordinator.

"It's a great thing to still be involved in something that has been such a huge
part of my life since I was 5," she said.

John Crotty, '69

"It didn't feel like I did anything out of the ordinary," said Crotty, a
four-sport standout. "Playing sports was just something you did in high school
or, at least, something I did."

Crotty earned seven varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball and track.
He played football at the University of Dayton.

A lifetime of speaking through her artwork

She doesn't look like a revolutionary. Now in her early 70s, Linda Lee Alter is
diminutive, gracious, and soft-spoken, with a fringe of white hair and rimless
glasses. During an interview in her light-filled Center City apartment, she was
dressed simply and conservatively: charcoal sweater vest, pearl-gray blouse,
black slacks, flats. Yet with one bold gesture, Alter has transformed
Philadelphia into a must-visit city for anyone interested in the work of female
artists.

Alter spent a quarter-century assembling an impressive collection: approximately
400 works made during the last four decades by more than 150 American women.
They include paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, fabric art,
and beadwork, created in a broad variety of styles. Two years ago, Alter gave
her entire collection to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. On Saturday,
the academy opens its inaugural exhibition of highlights from that collection:
"The Female Gaze: Women Artists Making Their World."

Although the addition of Alter's collection has dramatically increased PAFA's
holdings of works by women, these are by no means the first it has owned.
Established in 1805, the academy was both the nation's first public art museum
and its first art school; it also was a pioneer in educating women and hiring
them to teach. Visitors have long been able to view works by such distinguished
alumnae as Cecilia Beaux and Mary Cassatt, and others, including Helen
Frankenthaler and Georgia O'Keeffe. Still, Alter's donation to the academy's
collection represents an entirely different order of magnitude in terms of art
by women.

Alter is an interesting person, and an intriguing artist. A Philadelphia native
(Olney High School, Class of 1957), she still gets excited when describing the
picture she drew on the first day of first grade: three small birds escaping
from a cage - indicating how she felt about being cooped up in a classroom. More
important, according to Alter, even at 6, "I was aware that I could speak
through my art."

She attended the Philadelphia College of Art (now the University of the Arts)
and studied art education "because my parents wanted to be sure that I could get
a job."

In the end, she taught only briefly before marrying. Her husband's career
required moves to St. Louis, Atlanta, and Puerto Rico, during which time she
found work in "commercial" art, doing what we now call illustration. In 1966,
she and her husband returned to Philadelphia, where their daughter, Sara, was
born the following year (they later divorced). Alter trained in art therapy,
earning a master's degree in 1972.

But even before that, in the late 1960s, she had become serious about her own
art, using fabric to produce wall hangings studded with whimsical, brightly
colored animals, plants, and human figures, often with allusions to Old
Testament stories. (Though she practices Buddhist meditation and mindfulness,
Alter considers herself Jewish). These beautifully appliqued and stitched pieces
were inspired by her maternal grandmother, Bessie, a professional seamstress to
whom she was very close. Some were exhibited at the prestigious Philadelphia
Craft Show in 1980 and 1984.

When she was in her 50s, Alter switched to painting - in acrylics, the medium
she still favors. "Painting allowed me more freedom," she explains. "It was a
more immediate way to say the things I wanted to say."

Some of her paintings evoke the same childlike wonder and exuberance evident in
her fabric works. Others are surreal, with hints of dark emotion and thinly
veiled references to her personal life. Four years ago, the Allentown Art Museum
held a retrospective exhibition of Alter's work, including the hangings and her
acrylic pieces.

In the mid-1980s, she had begun collecting other people's art - initially folk
art because she found its patterns and lively colors so appealing. But after a
few months, she says, she realized that everything she had bought - and nearly
everything she had seen in galleries - was by men.

At that point, the modern American women's movement was still gathering steam,
and it was difficult to find art by women on display anywhere. As a result,
Alter decided to dedicate herself to making female artists and their work "more
visible" - a recurring phrase of hers.

From the start, she planned to give these works to a public museum so they would
be accessible to as many viewers as possible. She worked hard to collect a range
of objects by artists from varied backgrounds and made at different points in
their careers. At the same time, as she noted, "you have to set limits," so she
focused on art made by American women after 1970.

(In 1991, Alter founded the Leeway Foundation to make modest but life-changing
grants to individual women in the Philadelphia region. Over the years, her
daughter, Sara, a foundation officer, encouraged her to broaden its focus. It
now offers support to female and transgender artists, and has a large number of
people of color on its staff and board. Since 2007, Leeway has been a community
foundation, run apart from its founding family.)

Alter has a special fondness for artists with connections to the Philadelphia
region, so her collection includes purely abstract work by Edna Andrade,
expressionist stained glass by Judith Schaechter, and haunting photographs by
Zoe Strauss. But she also acquired a multitude of works by non-Philadelphians:
Washington native Elizabeth Catlett's politically powerful sculpture,
Nebraska-born Barbara Takenaga's paintings on rose petals, and prints by the
noted Inuit artist Jessie Oonark.

By 2008, after 25 years of gathering, Alter decided it was time to share her
collection with the world. So, with help from two close friends, she embarked on
a complicated effort to find the best permanent home for her art. For two years,
she did research, making secret visits to 11 promising institutions in five
states. She considered everything about the potential host museums, from signage
to restrooms to handicapped access and the attitudes of guards toward visitors.

From the outset, she notes, she was impressed by David Brigham and Robert
Cozzolino, the Pennsylvania Academy's president and senior curator,
respectively. They expressed a strong interest, and promised - as Alter required
- to fully integrate the new work into the permanent collection.

So in the end, she chose to make her gift to an institution that is also a
school, where art students will interact regularly with the objects she so
carefully assembled.

Ironically, her search ended at the museum closest to her home, so "I can visit
any time." Though she acknowledges she misses living with these works daily, she
also says, "They're like children . . . . You love them all, but at some point,
they have to go off to college."

Help kids go green with 'Old Red Shoe';
Book teaches eco-friendly values with craft projects that reuse household items

BYLINE: Jeanette Der Bedrosian

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 7D

LENGTH: 346 words


Children's book author and illustrator Anna Alter points to her years as a
preschool teacher as the inspiration for her new book, What Can You Do With an
Old Red Shoe?. Though she regularly used recycled goods for class art projects,
she found that most 4-year-olds don't know why recycling is so important.

Alter, 34, set out to teach children a lesson, creating a project book of easy
craft projects that reuse household items. From its namesake red-shoe planter to
a ripped-shower-curtain apron, Alter seeks to instill a desire to help the
environment.

"Kids, even if they don't make a huge impact when they're 4, can still learn the
values of 'I'm responsible for the things I buy and the things I do' and 'I can
still make a difference,' " she says. "Instilling that value can translate into
better recycling habits when they're older."

Each page of the book, released March 31, features an animal character that,
through a whimsical poem narrative, comes into contact with a reusable item. The
craft projects are designed for kids to take the initiative and usually require
minimal supervision, she says.

"It works for both school and home," says Alter, who taught preschool for five
years. "I think this book is the perfect avenue for teachers to use to teach
kids about recycling and to do it in a fun way."

Alter has been reusing bits and pieces around the house for projects since she
was a child, at the time out of economic necessity. "We couldn't afford to buy
all new things," she says. So it was natural for Alter to try out every project
in the book.

Her favorite? The "old red shoe" project, for which she named the book. "Most
families have some old shoes knocking around that they can't use anymore, and I
just think it's a sweet idea," she says. "I have one that I've made sitting on
my windowsill right now."

Alter, who lives in Boston, has written and illustrated other children's books,
including The Purple Ribbon, Three Little Kittens and the upcoming Abigail
Spells.

Tougher is better for Alter girls volleyball

BYLINE: By B.J. Bethel Staff Writer

SECTION: VARSITY; Pg. VA6

LENGTH: 337 words


Big games in the regular season have kept the Alter High School volleyball team
focused on its postseason goals.

The Knights opened the season Monday, Aug. 25, at Tippecanoe, a state
semifinalist last year and No. 2 in the final Division II state volleyball poll.
Alter played defending D-I state champion Cincinnati Mother of Mercy on
Wednesday.

Alter also will play Ursuline Academy, No. 5 in the final D-I poll in 2007, and
defending D-III state champion Lima Central Catholic.

"I guess we figure the tougher the teams we play, the better we are going to
be," Alter coach Tina Jasinowski said.

Alter began toughening its schedule nine years ago when it entered the Girls
Greater Cincinnati League. After an 0-11 record its first year, the program
upgraded its nonleague games.

"If you would have asked me then, having a tougher schedule wasn't a good
thing," Jasinowski said. "But in hindsight, it forced us to raise our level of
play."

As the team gradually improved, Alter began adding more state heavyweights to
its schedule. Jasinowski said Alter has played powerhouse Mother of Mercy the
first week of the season for several years.

"We have a fairly strong team with high goals, and that helps us get right into
it," Jasinowski said.

This year, Alter added Tipp. The two teams met in the playoffs in 2007, with
Tippecanoe winning and eventually making it to the state semifinals, where it
was eliminated by Columbus Bishop Hartley.

"Some of the matches we played then we dropped because we moved forward,"
Jasinowski said. "We wanted a greater challenge. Once we got acclimated, we
continued to build a stronger schedule."

The Alter program has gradually become a state power, winning D-II titles in
2002, '03 and '06. Jasinowski said being prepared by a tough regular season was
a key factor.

"I think increasing our competitiveness certainly helped us become one of the
best programs in the state," Jasinowski said.

"We continue to keep a nice strong schedule so it can better the team. More
often than not, it has paid off."

Lamber Awards celebrate the best of winter sports

BYLINE: DAVE LAMB HERE AND THERE

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD-8

LENGTH: 802 words


Pop quiz: Name the Best Team from the winter sports season in the south suburbs.
C'mon, you don't need any hints, do you? Think brown and gold (with their
uniforms). Aggressive and bold (with their stingy defense). Snowy and cold
(before their state final). Young and old (with solid senior leaders and
talented underclassmen). Okay, time's up. Pencils down. The Best Team, and a
multiple winner of this edition of the Lamber Awards, is the state champion
Alter High School girls basketball team. Other winners: Best Event: Always
something special about Oakwood hosting Bellbrook in boys basketball in The Pit.
Bellbrook rode the early season win to yet another Southwestern Buckeye League
title.

Best Signature Win: Alter's hockey team, coached by Jamie Ling, put itself on
the map with a surprising win over Cincinnati Moeller, 6-5, in the district
quarterfinals. Moeller won the Southwest Ohio High School Hockey League
championship.

Newest Old Event: Kettering's Trent Arena was the new host for Flyin' to the
Hoop, the 20-team showcase for some of the nation's top high school basketball
talent. The event was held the previous five years at Vandalia Butler's Student
Activity Center, Trent's predecessor as a firstclass campus facility.

Best New Event: Fairmont's wrestling team held its first Alumni Night with 30
former Fairmont, Fairmont East and Fairmont West wrestlers honored.

Best Sister Act: In a landslide it's the Christie sisters - Nicole, Ashley and
Courtney - who helped Alter win the state title. The talented trio's dad is
former University of Dayton guard Dan Christie.

Best All-Around Games:

Fairmont sophomore Cassie Sant registered an emphatic triple-double with 25
points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists in a girls basketball win over Springfield
South. Oakwood's Cathryn Hardy, an honorable mention All-Ohio player, nearly
posted a unique triple-double with 12 points, 12 rebounds and eight steals in a
win over West Carrollton.

Best Return: Alter's Courtney Chihil missed parts of her sophomore and junior
seasons after tearing anterior cruciate ligaments in both knees. She has made
the most of her senior season. The hard-nosed defender was a first-team All-Ohio
Division II selection in soccer. She was a second-team All-Ohio player on
Alter's state championship basketball team.

Sweetest Shooter: Check out Alter's Ryan Siggins.

Best Return Present: On a night when Fairmont welcomed back 34 former girls
basketball players from 1970 to the present, the Firebirds stunned Springboro,
the state's sixth-ranked team in front of 1,500 fans at Trent Arena.

Most Emphatic Payback:

Alter lost by one point to Columbus Eastmoor in last year's girls basketball
regionals. In a regional semifinal rematch this year, the Knights breezed to a
72-37 win.

Most Familiar Destination: Fairmont's girls basketball team, coached by Tim
Cogan, reached the district final for the fifth straight season.

Best by Land and Sea:

Alter's Ally Stover ran on the state championship cross country team and was a
state qualifier again in swimming. Stover is also one of Alter's top students
academically.

Best Game: West Carrollton entered The Pit at Oakwood with an 11-game winning
streak. The host Lumberjacks outlasted the Pirates in three overtimes for a
thrilling 76-70 win. Multisport star Chris Hardy led the effort with 22 points.

Best Timing: Joe Petrocelli's boys basketball team rounded into form late in the
season, riding a 10-game win streak to the regional final.

Best Distraction: Alter's state final was postponed two days by a 16-inch
snowfall in Columbus. The Knights were staying at the Fort Rapids Indoor Water
Park, where they were able to unleash some of their nervous energy.

Best Bowler: Fairmont's Jennifer Grady won the individual state championship
with a 730 series (276-237-217). Her Firebird team won the sectional and
district titles, then placed third at the state tournament. Fairmont's boys
placed fourth at state.

Brightest Hope: Fairmont wrestler Jake Sage became just the second Firebird
sophomore in school history to qualify for the state championship meet. Coach
Frank Baxter hopes Sage can join the small list of three Fairmont wrestlers -
Dave McVey, Chris Gelvin and Kenny Leckrone - who placed at the state meet as
juniors.

Loudest Rohr: Fairmont's Brittney Rohr made plenty of noise with her swimming
accomplishments. The Indiana University-bound swimmer competed in four events at
the state meet and has three school records to her credit.

Best Bet: Oakwood's swim team posted its best season ever. Look for even better
results next year. The team's individual state qualifiers were freshmen Maddie
Hochwalt and Natasha Wahl. They also qualified with sophomore Ellen Vierckl and
junior Haley Pohlman in the 400 freestyle relay.

Alter boys show off their depth in pool;
Knights dominate prelims at meet

BYLINE: By Debbie Juniewicz For Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C6

LENGTH: 547 words


BEAVERCREEK - The Knights set the tone early.

The Alter boys relay team of Casey Miller, Chris Douville, Mark Febus and Shane
Zimmer raced to a first-place finish in the 200-yard medley relay in preliminary
competition on the second day of competition Southwest Ohio High School Swimming
and Diving Classic Sunday.

Febus and Douville followed it up with individual first-place swims in the
100-yard breaststroke (1:03.54) and 200-yard backstroke (1:55.53), respectively.

Alter was one of 12 teams competing at the Beavercreek YMCA, one of seven venues
for the Classic.

The meet involves approximately 2,500 swimmers and divers from 108 schools
making it the largest invitational high school meet of its kind in the country.

The individuals and relay teams with the top 16 times in each event qualified to
the finals which were Sunday night at the Keating Natatorium in Cincinnati.

Douville's time in the backstroke was second only to Cincinnati Moeller's Matt
Angelini (1:55.07) going into the finals.

At Alter, however, swimming success isn't dependent upon superstars, it's all
about teamwork.

"We have those four strong kids but the next set of boys is also very talented,"
fourth-year Knights coach Barb Riazzi said. "We've had good individual swimmers
over the years, but this is the strongest team we've had since I've been here."

Depth paid off for the Sunday as Alter snagged three of the top six places in
the 200-yard backstroke as Miller finished third and Zimmer placed sixth. Febus
earned a second-place finish to Bellbrook's Johnny Jenkins in the 100-yard
freestyle. And the same Knights relay team finished second to Beavercreek in the
400-yard freestyle relay.

Alter junior Nick Anderson continued the Knights' winning ways in the 100-yard
individual medley with a first-place finish in 1:04.48.

"It's the first big meet of the season so it's a good chance to see what we can
do," Febus said.

Like the Knights, the Miamisburg girls were put to the test in the prelims
Sunday. They passed with flying colors.

Junior Laurie Caudy won both the 200-yard individual medley (2:13.67) and the
200-yard butterfly (2:11.47). Jessie Dobbins swam to a first-place finish in the
200-yard backstroke (2:11.28) and finished second to Caudy in the butterfly.

The duo also helped the Vikings earn second-place finishes in both the 200-yard
medley and 400-yard freestyle relays Sunday with Beavercreek earning both
first-place finishes.

Two years ago, the Miamisburg juniors turned a few surprised heads but there is
now an expectation of success for these returning state qualifiers.

"There is definitely more pressure on us now," Caudy said. "But the key is that
you don't worry about everyone else, you use the pressure to push yourself to be
better."

Success has helped build the Miamisburg program from just 17 swimmers in 2001 to
close to 50 this season.

"It's exciting to be a part of this team," Dobbins said.

* Centerville freshman Molly Eakins was a surprise second place finishers in the
girls diving finals held at Sycamore High School. She had a score of 387.85
points. Nicole Brehm of Monroe, a sophomore who was third at state last, was
first with 397.00. The field included several divers who placed in the state
meet last year and have experience in national and international competition.

Knights covet Coldwater rematch;
The Cavaliers stunned Alter 59-52 in three overtimes last year in the regional
semifinals.

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 416 words


DAYTON - The Welcome Stadium clock hadn't run out on Alter's 42-7 victory over
Hamilton Badin when talk turned to Coldwater.

"The whole team's been thinking about this ever since last year, ever since that
loss last year," Alter receiver Danny Jasper said. "It's been on our minds every
day."

To earn a playoff rematch against Coldwater, the Knights had to take care of
business on Friday, Nov. 7. Alter got two touchdowns apiece from quarterback
Austin Boucher and running back Cody Taulbee to win the Division IV, Region 16
semifinal.

"We heard everything in the papers that they were excited to play us," Alter
offensive lineman Evan Neff said. "We had to get through Badin to get to
Coldwater."

Alter (10-2) faces Coldwater (12-0) next Friday night at 7:30 p.m. at a site to
be announced Sunday afternoon. Coldwater defeated Oakwood, 35-7. The Alter
-Coldwater game will be a rematch of the Cavaliers' 59-52 triple-overtime win in
the regional semifinals last year.

"We haven't talked about this one (much)," Alter coach Ed Domsitz said.
"Occasionally, we'll mention the 'C' word."

The Knights took a 28-0 lead into halftime by capitalizing on Badin miscues.
Alter defeated Badin 56-7 earlier this year. Badin (8-4) scored first and last
in the two-game series. In between, Alter held the Rams scoreless for 91:22.

"I think that's the kind of team that could win state in any division but
Division I," Badin coach David Wirth said. "They're incredible."

The Knights' multi-pronged offense got 156 yards passing and 65 rushing from
Boucher. Taulbee added 30 yards and fullback Justin Hall had 65, including a
56-yard touchdown run.

"If you are going to give us a short field, we have a pretty potent offense,"
Domsitz said. "Our defense isn't too shabby. We've been playing well. If we can
continue to play this well, it ought to be a very interesting game next week."

Alter has had a strange trip to get to a rematch.

Linebacker Colin Boucher was lost for the season after an injury late in the
Week 1 game against Fairmont. That hurt a somewhat inexperienced defense.

Two Alter wins were declared forfeits. That ended the Knights' chances for home
field in the first round. But Alter ran the table.

"It's always tough to battle back from injury, like with Colin (Boucher) and
everything," Neff said. "But we've always believed in ourselves and took it one
game at a time and we knew were going to get here. And now we're finally here."

GIRLS BASKETBALL

MASON - As well as the Alter High School girls basketball team is playing, the
Knights still feel there's room for improvement.

And this is following Alter's 85-45 dismantling of Cincinnati Hughes in the
Division II district final on Friday at Mason High School.

"We definitely can still play better," said senior Maddie Bazelak, who led the
Knights with 20 points. "We're playing really well as a team."

They'll get no argument from Hughes (18-8). Alter led 26-8 after one quarter and
51-21 at the half. Bazelak outscored Hughes herself in the first quarter with
her 12 points.

Braxtin Miller had 16 points and Emma Bockrath scored 13 for Alter (26-0).

"You don't want to be playing your very best right now," Alter coach Chris Hart
said. "You always hope there's something you can get better at."

There wasn't much the Knights - ranked No. 1 in the final state poll - did
wrong.

Alter, which reached the state title game last season, plays the winner of
Columbus Bishop Hartley and Johnstown Monroe in the regional semifinals at 8
p.m. Tuesday at Springfield High School.

"We just know we have to come into practice and the games and work hard and push
ourselves," Bazelak said. "We know we can't get there just by being who we are.
We have to work for it just like every other team."

Tippecanoe 68, Cin. Mc-Nicholas 23: The Red Devils dominated to win the district
title and set up a third meeting with Central Buckeye Conference rival Kenton
Ridge, this time in the regional semifinals.

Tipp (26-0) plays Kenton Ridge (22-4) at 6:15 p.m. Tuesday at Springfield High
School. Tipp, ranked No. 2 in the state, beat Kenton Ridge 69-63 and 75-60
during the regular season.

"The last two games mean nothing." Tipp coach Ian Porto said. "They're going to
be ready to go. It's become a good rivalry in our league. We don't need any
motivation there."

Carly Clodfelter led the Red Devils with 16 points.

McNicholas (16-10) entered the game averaging 48 points. It's previous season
low was 27 against D-III district finalist Cincinnati Summit Country Day.

Kenton Ridge 39, Valley View 37: Jamari McDavid put back an offensive rebound
with 9.9 seconds left to lift KR.

Valley View didn't get off a final shot off an inbounds play with 3.3 seconds
left.

"At practice my coach tells me do not think about it and hurry it like it's a
last-second shot," said Mc-David, who had 14 points and seven rebounds. "They
tell me to breathe and lay it up there like it's a normal shot."

The Cougars (22-4) were making their sixth straight district final appearance.
It was their second straight district championship, the first time KR has done
that since the 1995 and 1996 teams accomplished it.

It was the first district final appearance for the Spartans (21-5) since 1995.

Students learn in good taste;
Alter High School seniors create, take part in the Alter Chef Club.

KETTERING - Jesse Langenderfer runs track and Nicole Christie plays basketball,
but when it comes to cooking, the two Alter High School seniors are on the same
team.

They love it.

This past September they came up with the idea of starting a chef club. "There
weren't any clubs for cooking," Christie said.

They enlisted Maureen Willits, who teaches the school's two one-semester
elective chef classes, to help start the Alter Chef Club. Willits donates her
time for club meetings, finds recipes for the group, and supervises the cooking.
"At the first organizational meeting 57 kids showed up," Willits said.

"The club has become one of the biggest clubs at Alter," said Langenderfer,
co-president with Christie. Hank Keighly, an Alter Knights football player, is
vice president, while Matt Dorow, a school soccer player, is club treasurer.

"Everybody can join," Langenderfer said. "It's homey and comfortable. Everybody
likes making cookies and pastries."

The chef classes are for juniors or seniors, but freshmen and sophomores can
join the club.

"It's neat to see the seniors take them under their wings," Willits said.

"You learn how to read recipes, what leavening agents to use, what tastes good
together and what doesn't taste good together," Christie said. "It's kind of
nice to know your way around the kitchen."

On a recent Tuesday, about 20 students met to make buckeyes, green and red York
Peppermint Patty sugar cookies, and sweet/salty pretzel kisses.

Three football team seniors - Tim Cableck, a linebacker, Bo Vari, a center, and
Sean O'Bryan, a safety - deftly mashed the balls of sugar cookie dough with the
end of a green-sugar-encrusted glass to form near-uniform circles.

"It's fun. I love cooking cookies," O'Bryan said.

"I really like food. I like to cook," said sophomore Christine Weaver, baking
pretzel kisses nearby.

"By far it's my favorite club," said Collin Boucher, a football linebacker,
helping make buckeyes.

The students meet once a month before school to plan. They cook in the school's
chef room, which has five stoves, after school. Each student pays $5 toward that
month's ingredients, which the students or Willits shop for.

Kettering schools keep up giving spirit for holidays;
Annual food and gift drives are on schedule

BYLINE: By Joanne Clodfelter For the Dayton Daily News

KETTERING - Although many Kettering schools and preschools have spent the first
part of the school year collecting money, food and personal care items for
victims of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, they plan to give even more through
their annual holiday food and gift drives.

* Kiddie Kampus Daycare Center, 2881 E. Dorothy Lane, has created a Halloween
haunted house for parents and students.

The price of admission is a canned item, which is donated to a local food bank,
according to Shannon Miller, the preschool teacher at Kiddie Kampus.

* According to Stan Troha, campus minister at Alter High School, several Alter
service organizations will continue their holiday giving traditions.

Alter's first holiday event is a kickoff for the Key Club's annual holiday food
drive.

A meal for the community is sponsored by Alter's peer ministry. In exchange for
a cash donation, students will serve hot dogs, beans and homemade desserts from
11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesday in the Alter High School gym.

Last year the event raised $900.

Alter's Key Club, mentored by Norm Rich, has held the holiday food drive for
four decades. Last year Alter collected $8,000 and four tons of food from
students. The donations were given to St. Vincent Hotel, Catholic Social
Services, St. James' foodbank and St. Paul United Methodist Church's foodbank.

* Ascension School and Greenmont Elementary School, which are near each other on
the east side of Kettering, both collect items for their neighborhoods.

Brent Devitt, principal at Ascension, said that each month the church collects
items for the Greenmont-Oak Park Community Church food pantry next door.

He said each month a pair of first-graders goes to each classroom to remind
students about donating food.

He said Ascension students tour the food pantry so they can see shelves that
need to be filled every week.

For the past two years, the school has held an All Saints Day party Nov. 1. This
year the price of admission was a canned good or personal care item.

At Greenmont, each year the students donate items for holiday food baskets,
which are provided to up to 30 families of Greenmont students.

Corene Taylor, the school secretary, said that they also collect donations for
the Kettering Clothing Room, which is available to all needy students in the
district.

"We try to take care of our own," Taylor said.

* One of the easiest ways for schools to help the needy is to participate in the
local Holiday Aid food drive.

All proceeds are donated to The Foodbank at 427 Washington St. in Dayton.

Barbara Heck of Miller-Valentine Realty is the coordinator for Holiday Aid,
which began in 1985.

Each year, Heck contacts schools in Montgomery County to see if they would like
to participate.

The Ohio National Guard and Tobin Brothers Moving and Storage deliver the food
barrels to the schools, and pick them up after the food drive.

In 2004, almost a dozen Kettering schools participated in Holiday Aid, out of 90
participants in Montgomery County.

A traveling trophy is awarded to the high school, middle school, elementary
school and preschool that collect the most food.

Lin Sartin, student council adviser at Kettering Middle School, said they have
participated in Holiday Aid for at least 10 years.

She said a competition is held among the central, south and north units in the
school to collect the most food.

"We have kids who go door to door with wagons to collect food," Sartin said.
"Sometimes parents pull up to the door and open the trunk of the car, and it's
full of food.

"I don't care how we do against other schools," Sartin said. "I just want to
continue to give as much as we can."

Mary Kay Breving of Kindercare at 1111 E. Stroop Road, Kettering, said their
school sets up the Holiday Aid barrels in a conspicuous spot so parents of all
their students can easily contribute.

The kids decorate the barrels with their artwork.

Last year, Holiday Aid collected more than 93,000 pounds of food and $8,500 in
monetary contributions.

"Holiday Aid is a wonderful way to teach our young people about giving and
helping others," said Vel Hux, director of marketing and development for The
Foodbank, a United Way partner agency.

"It's important to realize that there are many people here in our community
needing help. This food helps our Miami Valley neighbors."

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. A14

Additional tennis court seems to benefit Alter

The City of Kettering, despite protests from many citizens, has proceeded with
plans to add a fifth tennis court at Ernst Park on East David Road.

The addition of a fifth court in the location chosen - adjacent to the four
existing courts - is costly, as it involves removal of several trees and
extensive leveling of the ground where the court is to be built.

Why a fifth court at this location? All other parks with tennis courts have
either two or four courts. Only Fairmont High School and the old Fairmont East
High School (now Indian Riffle Elementary) have more courts.

Alter High School uses Ernst Park tennis courts as its "home" site. High school
matches involve five matches. When Alter is the home team, one match must wait
for a match to end.

Although the city claims the court is not being built for Alter's benefit, why
just a fifth court in the most costly location?

Alter High School plays its home football games at Fairmont field. If Alter
wants to play its five home tennis matches simultaneously, it could come to a
similar arrangement with Fairmont.

- GARY HAUG, KETTERING

Police used excessive force on teenage boy

The article "Family sues city over arrest," July 2, about the police subduing a
teenager, lessened the amount of trust I hold for police department policy. On
the chance a neighbor could provide useful information, such as relating to
police that the young man was mentally handicapped, that should be accepted by
police in lieu of threatening to arrest the neighbor for interference.

There was no reason for the amount of force used in this circumstance. The
officers involved could have followed the young man where he was going (home)
and issued the boy or his mother a bicycle citation. It could have and should
have ended there.

I believe the use of Tasers, retractable nightsticks, pepper spray and fists was
excessive, considering this started as the result of the suspect committing a
bicycle infraction. The responsibility for all that transpired rests with the
way this minor misdemeanor was handled by the responding officers. Apparently,
riding a bike the wrong way down a street isn't as dangerous as disrespecting
the feelings of police officers in a bicycle pursuit.

GOP's behavior during Twitter event was childish

The Republican Party's recent assault on President Obama's Twitter Town Hall was
rude, immature and base. What could have been a rational, open exchange between
the president and the American citizenry regarding issues, rather than political
stratagem, turned into an example of just how self-centered and puerile the
Republican Party has become.

In attempting to keep the president from speaking directly to Americans, they
succeeded not only in denying the people an opportunity to share their thoughts
and feelings, but also in further molesting the concept of open and rational
discourse.

Like spoiled, undisciplined children having a tantrum in the middle of an adult
conversation, they opted not for coherent discussion of the real issues, but
rather how they could bully others into getting their own way.

Their behaviors have been pathetic, with no sense of dignity or decency. Most of
our mothers would be ashamed if we acted this way.

I can only hope that the speaker of the House sends me an invitation to his next
family party. I'd certainly like the opportunity to afford him the same courtesy
that he allowed the American people.

Alter coach poised to carry on tradition;
Corrie Weckesser takes over team that went 16-3-1 last year.

BYLINE: By Dave Lamb Contributing Writer

SECTION: BELLBROOK AND SUGARCREEK TWP; Pg. RE-10

LENGTH: 298 words


If Corrie Weckesser wasn't already familiar with the Alter High School girls
soccer program, this is how athletic director Chris Hart could have approached
her before and after offering her the head coaching job.

Before: "You will take over a tradition-rich program that reached the regional
final last year with a 16-3-1 record."

After: "Oh, by the way, you graduated all 11 starters.

Either way, Weckesser is poised for the challenge to succeed Jason Balogh, who
stepped down after nine successful seasons.

"I've wanted to be the head of a program," she said. "Once I got involved with
the Alter program, I respected the values and morals and the outstanding
tradition of Alter."

The former Beavercreek High School standout - then as Corrie Vuckovich - started
her coaching career with the freshmen team at Mesa High School in Arizona in
2000. After returning to the Dayton area, she spent three years with the Carroll
program and the past two seasons at Alter.

Weckesser, who spent last season as a varsity assistant, is unfazed by losing so
much experience from the team.

"We have eight players returning, a strong JV team and I heard we have an
outstanding incoming freshmen class," she said.

Weckesser, who teaches third grade at Incarnation School in Centerville, knows
she wants to instruct her players on more than returning to the state
tournament.

"I'm coaching the whole person," she said. "I want to teach responsibility on
and off the field, dedication to academics, soccer and family."

She'll keep family in mind when planning her practice schedule. Her husband,
Jim, a former outstanding runner at Centerville High School and Bowling Green,
coaches the Elk cross country team.

"We'll try to schedule practices at the same time so we can actually have dinner
together," Weckesser said.

Alter wins seventh straight title

BYLINE: By Greg Billing Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 483 words


TROY - Winners of seven straight Division II regional championships in high
school cross country, Alter's girls should have the team celebration pose down
by now.

The Knights, though, struggled to get everyone lined up for the group shot.
Consider it the Knights' only misstep Saturday afternoon at the 3.1-mile course
on the Troy levee.

Alter placed four runners among the top 18 in team points and all five cracked
the top 31. Alter's 56 points easily outdistanced runner-up Greenon's 90 and
earned the Knights a spot at the state meet Saturday at Scioto Downs in
Columbus.

The top four teams and top 16 individuals not on qualifying teams advance to the
state meet.

"We were just saying how the freshmen on this year's team were in the third
grade when this streak started," Alter coach Matt Sableski said. "They can't
take ownership of the streak, but they do take a lot of pride in it and want to
defend it."

Alter junior Olivia Albers finished seventh overall to pace the Knights, who had
four runners cross the line before Greenon's second runner.

"Rebecca Esselstein is a huge inspiration to me. ... If it weren't for her that
first mile there's no way I was going to make it through the race," Albers said
of her senior teammate. "She was ahead of me almost the entire time and I kept
telling myself I have to keep up with her. She's so motivating and so
determined."

That's also the mind set of Carroll senior Chadd Kiggins. With Mason senior and
two-time state champion Zach Wills winning the D-I regional title in a record 15
minutes, 15.8 seconds, Kiggins and the rest of the D-I boys field played catch
up.

"Just trying to qualify for state, so mission accomplished," Kiggins said of his
third-place finish, nearly 39 seconds behind Wills. "It's definitely a challenge
knowing he's one of the top in the nation. ... He's not going to break and I'll
see if I can keep with him."

Springboro's girls team finished second in D-I behind Carly Hamilton's
sixth-place finish overall. The Panthers finished second at state in 2009 and
expectations are again high.

"Our goal all along has been to win state and I still think we have a shot at
doing it," coach Ron Rohrer said. "It won't be easy but the girls' mental
attitude is very, very good."

Versailles junior Tammy Berger, the D-III defending state champ, won the
regional title (18:45.2) by 17 seconds over Xenia Christian sophomore Bethany
Norman.

"My goal was to stay with her because she's a great runner," Norman said after
clinching her second state berth. "I stayed with her until the 1.5-mile mark,
which was good because last week I stayed with her for a mile."

Norman, however, is chasing more than just Berger. She's also after her mom
Robin's high-school personal best of 18:45 and trails by 13 seconds.

"I'm getting there. She's pushing me," Norman said.

Alter High School basketball standout Danny Bruner didn't simply lead the
Greater Catholic League in blocked shots last season. He also had more swats
than every team in the league except Cincinnati St. Xavier.

But you won't hear the 6-foot-7 senior boasting that he owns the lane. Instead,
he'll soft sell the accomplishment that he says came mostly against shorter
players and that he had pretty good timing.

When he lists his highlights from Alter's 12-10 season, he won't immediately
mention his threepointer with three seconds left that beat Cincinnati Purcell
Marian. Or his trey at the buzzer that forced overtime against Cincinnati
McNicholas.

"The last-second finishes are great to have," he said. "But I like the games
when we win comfortably, where everyone gets to play and everyone contributes."

That's the sort of modest attitude that Alter coach Joe Petrocelli is going to
miss. And that Fairmont State University coach Tim Murphy is going to inherit.

Bruner recently signed a letter of intent to play basketball at the NCAA
Division II school in Fairmont, W. Va., near Morgantown.

"Danny's going to do very well," Petrocelli said. "He really came into his own
halfway through last year and we relied on him a lot this year. He's very
coachable and he's a very good student."

Bruner led the Knights in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (6.6). He also paced the
team in shooting percentage on two-pointers (51.7) and three-pointers (32.8). He
earned first-team All-GLC North Division honors.

Bruner, who carries better than a 3.9 grade-point average, is considering a
business major at Fairmont. He's working this summer for Kohls Landscaping.

Fairmont State graduates just two players from a 13-14 team.

Bright prospects for Firebirds

Even though his starting lineup this season usually consisted entirely of
underclassmen, including two who had never played volleyball before, Kettering
Fairmont High School boys coach Bill Buirley isn't shy about setting the bar
rather high for them.

"This team has the potential to be the best team I've coached," said Buirley,
who started the program in 1998.

That's lofty praise for an inexperienced team that finished the regular season
one game under .500 (10-11).

But Buirley knows talent when he sees it. He coached the 2000 team to a 25-3
record and a spot in the regional final against Centerville. The '04 team
reached the state tournament and posted a 19-7 mark.

"We have a great group of athletes," the coach said. "We're very, very young.
It's taken us awhile to learn the nuances of the game, to read what the opponent
is doing."

The Firebirds finally showed their firepower in the regular season finale
against Cincinnati Princeton.

While a lot of teams rely on one big gun, Buirley believes a balanced attack
will be Fairmont's hallmark the next couple of years.

Against Princeton, Nick Fox and Tim Missimer, a first-year player, each recorded
15 kills. Jon Burt, another newcomer, collected eight kills. Setter Travis
Weitthoff finished the night with 45 assists, just two shy of Matt Lykins'
school record. He later tied the record in a first-round tournament win against
Lakota West

Fox, a junior who recently earned All-Region honorable mention, and Jon Dixon,
the team's lone senior, served as captains.

Sad day for Knights;
West Holmes' defense stifles Alter for state championship.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL DIVISION II STATE FINAL

Alter players console each other after Millersburg West Holmes won the matchup
of undefeated teams - and the Division II girls state championship. The Knights
finished 29-1.

Dayton women's basketball coach Jim Jabir wants his team feisty and aggressive
as it anticipates an NCAA tournament bid on Monday.

COLUMBUS - Watching its opponent accept the state championship trophy Saturday
was the second-hardest thing Alter faced. Trying to score against Millersburg
West Holmes was even more daunting.

Held scoreless over a nine-minute stretch of the first half, Alter watched as
West Holmes methodically pulled away en route to a 62-45 victory in the Division
II state final at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center.

West Holmes (29-0) finished the season as the lone unbeaten team in Ohio girls
basketball. Alter finished 29-1.

The Knights led 7-0 less then three minutes in but managed seven more points
over the final 13:35 of the first half. That included a 3-pointer by Kara
Bockrath at the halftime buzzer. West Holmes led 23-14 at intermission.

"We attempted to play a matchup zone to start with because of their size," West
Holmes coach Lisa Patterson said. "But they were getting easy shots at the
basket and I thought we were scrambling a lot on defense. We switched back to
man early and did what we've done all year. I think that was the difference."

Alter co-head coach Chris Hart said, "We expected them to play man-to-man,
that's what they do. I wouldn't say that affected us. We got good looks and had
the right kids shooting the ball. We just stopped being able to shoot the ball
for whatever reason. It became a snowball."

Alter managed five field goals in the first half and didn't score a field goal
in the third quarter until 1:12 remained. West Holmes outscored the Knights
37-17 in the second and third quarters.

It was the Knights' lowest of-

Here's the difference between the University of Dayton's men's and women's
basketball teams today.

On this Selection Sunday, the Flyer men are clinging desperately to the bubble,
hoping the NCAA Tournament Committee appreciates their 23-10 resume and gives
the program its first bid since 2009.

But there's no bubble rap for the UD women.

As they head into their Selection Monday, they are carrying a chip on their
shoulders while awaiting their fifth NCAA invite in a row.

Not content with just getting into the big dance, they want to prove they are a
Sweet 16 team. That would mean getting out of the first weekend of tournament
play, something the Flyers have never done.

Sure they are averaging 82 points per game (13th in the nation), have a 23-7
record, won the Atlantic 10 regular season with a 15-1 mark and were in the Top
25 poll a substantial part of the season, but they were upset by Fordham in the
title game of A-10 tournament last weekend and coach Jim Jabir said that loss
may have put a tiny seed of doubt in the selection committee's mind.

It may affect their seed, something strategically critical when trying to win
two games and advance to the second weekend.

More importantly, it might cloud the uninformed's perception of who the Flyers
really are.

Jabir played off that at practice these past couple of days.

"Wherever we go we're going with a chip on our shoulder, and I'm not talking
about a potato chip," he told his team as it huddled around him after practice
in the Cronin Athletics Center (CAC) gym.

Later, in the quiet of his office, he would explain: "We're using that Fordham
loss as rocket fuel. I am on them really hard now and I remind them every day
that Fordham has our trophy. No disrespect to Fordham - they earned that
championship - but I'm going to use that loss every way I can to try to get our
team out of that first weekend.

"I tell them we're not respected. That people think we're soft."

With a smile and shrug he added: "At times, it's almost like making stuff up to
motivate them."

Yet it's not all coach-speak or motivational manipulation, said Andrea Hoover,
the heart and soul of the Flyers and the A-10 player of the year:

"I think any mid-major team, any non-BCS team, has to put a chip on their
shoulder going into the NCAA tournament because now they don't get a lot of
respect. And by us losing the championship game we have an even bigger chip now.
We have to prove that we belong. That we're not just a one-and-done team, but
one that can go far into the tournament."

Some sharp words

On the long bus ride back from the A-10 tournament in Richmond, Va., Jabir had
plenty of time to think, to stew and finally to formulate the way he was going
to reawaken his Flyers.

"We got off that bus around midnight and I brought the team into the lobby of
the CAC and I ripped them," he said. "I told them we weren't as disciplined and
sharp and tight as we have been and that's not acceptable. And if someone didn't
like it they could leave.

"I said we were getting back to form. I told them how it was when Justine
(Raterman) and her class were here. It was 'yes sir, no sir.' No eye rolling. No
arguments. No side conversations.

"We encourage participation and conversation and ownership, but sometimes this
bunch was going too far. It wasn't a big problem, but it was enough to affect
our focus at the end of a game. And the guys doing all the talking were the ones
who weren't doing all the executing."

One person he was not talking about was Hoover.

The 5-foot-9 junior guard leads the team in minutes, scoring (17.2 ppg.),
free-throw percentage (93.5) and assists, is second in steals and 3-point
accuracy and third in rebounds.

"She's everything to this team - symbolically, literally, the way she plays and
her attitude," Jabir said. "With her, there is no drama. It's just, 'What do you
need done? OK, I'll do it.' I love the kid. And she's tough as nails."

He mentioned an early-season game at Iowa: "She bruised her tailbone taking a
charge. She really hit hard. Then she took three more charges that knocked her
on her (rump). ...We have some kids that would never take one charge."

Hoover laughed when she heard her coach's recounting and said it didn't happen
quite like that.

Although she has never missed a game in her career, she said that charge with
"seven or eight minutes left" in the second half sent her to the bench for the
rest of the day.

"It was like a hip pointer. I landed perfectly on my tailbone and it hurt really
bad. I had to get a shot to fly home and it was awful. After that my family and
the coaches, they all said, 'You probably shouldn't take so many charges...
blah... blah... blah.' "

She played the next game against Akron and took three more charges.

Three weeks ago against Saint Joseph's she drove to the basket and went up for a
shot, but, as she explained it, "I got tripped in the air and landed right on my
elbow. I've always had trouble with my elbow and so I stayed down a little bit."

The UD Arena crowd quieted as she stayed prone on the foul line nearest the
student section. But as Jabir and trainer Kristin Tritt were heading to her from
the bench, she began to get up. Though her face was contorted in pain, she got
one look at them and literally shooed them away.

The crowd laughed.

She did not.

"When I saw the trainer, that's why I got mad," she explained Saturday. "If the
trainer comes out to you, you automatically have to go out of the game. I was
like 'Get off the court! ... GET OFF THE COURT!!"

Building tradition

Hoover said her no-drama, give-no-quarter attitude came from her parents - "with
them it was pretty straightforward, 'Do something right or you don't play' " -
and especially her two older brothers.

"They would beat me up playing sports," she said. "With them, if you can't do
anything right, you pay for it."

Once she got to UD, she learned from players like Raterman (1,832 points and 919
rebounds), who was a senior when she was a freshman.

"With Justine, it wasn't just the two-hour practice, she was always in the gym
getting up extra shots and working hard on her own," Hoover said. "She and some
of the other players on the team and those who came right before them, they
established the NCAA tournament tradition here."

In the past four seasons the Flyers have gone 93-36. They've made the NCAA
tournament as a seventh seed last year and an eighth seed in 2010 - both times
advancing to the second round - and were No. 11 seeds in 2011 and 2012.

Jabir said landing players like Raterman - and Kristin Daugherty and Kendall
Ross before that

- helped elevate the program.

"It takes a lot of courage for one of those kids to come to Dayton," he said
quite candidly. "If a kid looks at Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue - those
teams are expected to go to the NCAA tournament. They're expected to do great
things There's less risk involved.

"If you come here - and hopefully we will get our fifth NCAA tournament bid on
Monday - we say there's a good chance to go to the tournament. But there's still
a risk.

"I ask every really great player who comes here: 'Are you courageous enough? Are
you confident enough to walk into your high school the next day (after
committing) and tell them you are coming to Dayton?'

"The way we try to sell it is that we're a top-20 team, but we're not where we
want to be yet and you can help us go to the next step. You can be a
difference-maker. But that takes a special type of kid, because everyone doesn't
want that."

Jabir admitted going to the NCAA tournament helps the sell.

"It's all marketing and perception. It's what's sexy right now. Kids see you on
TV and hear the announcers say really cool things about you and they want that."

Hoover said nothing tops the allure of the NCAA tournament:

"Anyone who is playing college basketball, it's their dream to be in the NCAA
tournament. You want to be part of March Madness and the Cinderella stories and
all that other stuff - but we want more than that, too.

"We want to really prove ourselves and make a statement to everyone."

French teacher finds new path in counseling

BYLINE: HEREABOUTS

SECTION: BELLBROOK & SUGARCREEK TWP.; Pg. RE2

LENGTH: 612 words


Tina Pernik knew she wanted to be a French teacher at a young age. But to her
surprise, when the opportunity arose and she left her career as a French teacher
at Bellbrook High School to become a guidance counselor at the same school, she
found she liked her new position just as much.

"I had taken French class at Alter High School, and my teacher was so phenomenal
that I knew I wanted to teach French also," said Pernik, who actually taught
French at Archbishop Alter High School after graduating from college.

"French was my first love, but as a guidance counselor, I'm helping students and
their parents prepare for the whole college process. I try to answer all of the
questions that go along with a college search."

Tina Pernik, the daughter of Jack, now deceased, and Miriam Fitzharris, was born
in Dayton, but moved to Centerville at the age of 2.

"We were the 50th family to join Incarnation Church," said Pernik, who attended
kindergarten and first-grade in Centerville, but then transferred to Incarnation
when the Catholic school opened. "I used to baby sit Phil Donahue's kids and
they lived over by Erma Bombeck, so I'd be in and out of her house, too."

Pernik attended Archbishop Alter High School in Kettering where she was active
in the French Club, Spanish Club, Future Teachers of America and the Key Club, a
service organization that she now co-advises at Bellbrook High School along with
Jenny Kaffenberger.

After graduating from high school in 1968, Tina Pernik attended Ohio University
where she studied French and education. While student teaching in Cleveland with
her best friend from high school, Joni Pernik Hinshaw, she met Joni's brother,
Jay Pernik, who was studying mechanical engineering at Case Western Reserve.

The couple married in 1974 and moved to Nashville, Tenn., before moving back to
Centerville where Tina taught French at Alter High School with Keith and Cathy
St. Pierre. Meanwhile, Jay Pernik joined the family business, Dayton Products,
founded by his father, John Pernik, who has since passed away.

After four years of teaching, Tina Pernik remained at home with the couple's two
children, Juliana and Audrey. Juliana is a 2001 Alter High School graduate who
earned a degree in psychology from Washington University in St. Louis, and is
currently pursuing a master's degree in public administration at the Ohio State
University Glenn School of Public Affairs. Juliana Pernik also started a young
adult service group, called Columbus Gives Back, www.columbus givesback.org,
that currently has more than 250 members who meet to socialize and give back to
the community.

Audrey Pernik graduated from Centerville High School in 2001, and from American
University in Washington, D.C., in 2007 with a degree in broadcast journalism.
Following a television reporting job in Charlottesville, Va., she returned to
Washington, D.C., where she currently works for the American Public Health
Association while pursuing a graduate degree in public health from George
Washington University.

In 1990, Tina Pernik began teaching French at Meadowdale High School where she
remained for five years before accepting a position teaching French at Bellbrook
High School. After earning a master's degree in school counseling from Wright
State University, she became a guidance counselor. In addition to sponsoring a
college planning night every January, Pernik also takes the students on a campus
caravan, a road trip to visit and become familiar with different campuses.

She is an avid biker, who despite her hectic schedule, ensures that she has
home-cooked meals, by preparing and freezing 150 entrees during the summer
months when she is not in school.

Being best has become a way of life at Alter;
Success contagious, builds competition among Knights athletic programs.

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 394 words


KETTERING - Alter High School has won so many state team championships it had to
build a new trophy case. Literally.

A hallway full of old lockers were ripped out this summer and replaced with a
custom wood-and-glass trophy case that was fully finished in November.

"All we have in these trophy cases are district, regional and state champion or
runner-up trophies from the mid-to-late '90s through the 2000s and it's almost
full," said Alter Athletic Director and girls basketball coach Chris Hart.

Hart said it took her and a volunteer five hours to place the trophies. The old
ones were relegated to storage in another building.

"I don't know if we understand just how fortunate we are," Hart said of the
students. "When another (Alter) team goes to state, it's like, 'Oh, they're
going to state ... because everybody does it.' "

That's not really an exaggeration. Win or lose, the Knights will add another
shiny prize after the Division II state basketball championship game which tips
off at 2 p.m. today, March 20.

That will be Alter's 20th state title or runner-up trophy in the past 10 years.
The Knights have eight different state titles in that span in five sports. The
firsts or seconds have come in eight sports.

"There's competitiveness among the student body," girls basketball player Ashley
Christie said. "The football guys are always saying, 'Oh, we got two state rings
and you've only got one.' They're always rubbing it in our faces. It builds
competition."

Overall, Alter has 19 Ohio High School Athletic Association-sponsored state team
titles. That ranks in a tie for 17th in the state and second in the Dayton
region behind Minster's 24. St. Henry also has 19.

Not bad for a school with just one title in the 1970s and two in the 1980s.

"For one thing, there were three divisions back in the '70s and we were in the
big-school division. That's obviously different now," Hart said. "The reasons
you win is because of the kids, the coaching and the parents. ... I think it
perpetuates itself. Kids want to be a part of that."

And yes, the Knights realize their success can rub others the wrong way.

"If I was on the other side of it, it would get old fast," Hart said. "It really
would."

But Alter is fine with being the school known for winning a bunch. Said Hart:
"We're OK with it."

GIRLS BASKETBALL ALTER 65, KENTON RIDGE 48;
Alter heads to ?inal four with unbeaten record.

SPRINGFIELD - One by one, Alter girls basketball players ascended the ladder to
get their piece of the net. "One Shining Moment" played over the loudspeakers,
reminding the Knights that March is here and they're still alive.

Alter dominated the boards with its height advantage and pulled away from Kenton
Ridge for good late in the third quarter to win 65-48 in a Division II regional
final at Springfield High School and advance to the state final four for the
first time since 2010.

Second-ranked Alter (28-0) will play Toledo Rogers at 1 p.m. Thursday at Value
City Arena at the Jerome Schottenstein Center in Columbus.

"We're going to enjoy tonight," Alter coach Christina Hart said, "and we'll
worry about next week later."

Emma Bockrath led Alter with 15 points. Maddie Bazelak had 14. Kara Bockrath
added 11, and Braxtin Miller scored 12. Baylee Bennett led the No. 7 Cougars,
who finished 26-2, with 16 points.

Alter dominated the early minutes, taking a 15-5 lead with a 9-0 run. Kenton
Ridge wasted little time getting back in it and tied it at 15-15 with a layup by
Stefanie Davis in the final minute. Alter got back on top at the end of the
quarter, 17-15, on a jump shot by Emma Bockrath with seconds to play.

Alter built on the momentum of that last basket in the second quarter and
outscored the Cougars 14-7 to take a 31-22 halftime lead.

Emma Bockrath had 10 points at halftime, and Bennett led the Cougars with 12.

In the third quarter, Kenton Ridge cut the deficit to 39-34 and 41-36. Both
times Alter moved ahead by seven on the next possession. Finally, the Knights
put the Cougars away by scoring the last nine points of the quarter to lead
50-36.

"I think we wore them down honestly," Hart said. "They're not really deep. We're
a lot bigger than they are. We were hoping coming in that would be an
advantage."

Alter advances to the state final four for the fifth time and the first time in
four years. The Knights also won regional titles in 2002, 2008, 2009 and 2010.
They won their only state title in 2008 and placed second in 2010.

Kenton Ridge was seeking its first regional championship since 1995. It also
played in the final four in 1991.

Toledo Rogers (23-4) beat Bellevue 52-40 on Friday to advance to the final four.
On the other side of the bracket, Millersburg West Holmes advanced by beating
Zanesville Maysville 45-26. It will play the winner of today's Beloit West
Branch game against Akron Saint Vincent-Saint Mary at 3 p.m. Thursday.

St. Xavier exacts a little revenge on Alter, 69-47

BYLINE: By Brian Gillespie Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 370 words


KETTERING - For the Alter Knights, membership in the Greater Catholic League can
be both a blessing and a curse. On Friday night, the latter reared its ugly
head.

Alter, a small Division II school, received a 69-47 beating at the hands of
Division I powerhouse Cincinnati St. Xavier, its GCL brethren from the South
Division. The Knights never challenged St. Xavier (11-1, 7-1 GCL), which came in
with plenty of motivation after being upset by its smaller foe last season.

"I think they were a little fired up for us because we beat them last year,"
said Alter coach Joe Petrocelli. "We hadn't beaten them in eight years going
into that game last year and they ended up in the state title game against
Cincinnati Moeller."

The Bombers, ranked third in the state, never trailed as they silenced an often
raucous Alter home crowd. St. Xavier senior stalwarts Walt Gibler and Brad
Loesing made sure the Knights weren't able to produce a repeat performance,
combining for 34 of their team's points. Gibler scored 22 points on the block,
while Loesing scored 12 from the perimeter. focused knowing that last year,
Alter came in and played a great game against us and knocked us off," said St.
Xavier head coach Scott Martin. "I think this year these guys were ready and
knew that Alter is a good team."

Alter (7-5, 3-4), playing the third of its four games against the tough GCL
South, didn't wake up until the contest was already out of reach. Jamarre White
paced the Knights with 15 points, and Ryan Siggins added 11.

"They're a very good team," Petrocelli said of the Bombers. "They beat you in a
lot of ways. They're big, they're strong and they shoot the ball well. Also,
they don't miss free throws. They're like 73 percent from the free-throw line
for the season."

St. Xavier didn't disappoint from the outset, sprinting out to a 20-6 lead early
in the second quarter. The Bombers hit two of their six 3-pointers, and Gibler
posted six points during the spurt. St. Xavier's lead ballooned to as large as
19 before the end of the first half.

White did his best to get the Knights back into the contest in the second half
with nine consecutive points bridging the quarters, but they never managed to
get closer than 11 at 50-39.

Harshberger, Creek 'flying now';
Creek dominates first-year Alter team for 5th straight win

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi mgokavi@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 387 words


CENTERVILLE - Mike Harshberger is Exhibit A.

"Size isn't everything in hockey," the Beavercreek senior said after Tuesday
night's 6-0 win against Alter at South Metro Ice-N-Inline. "I've been playing
since I was 4, and it hasn't affected me too much."

At 5-foot-6 and 123 pounds, Harshberger's stature isn't imposing. His skating
is.

"His greatest asset is his speed," Beavercreek coach Matt Tramonte said. "He's a
great skater. He just kind of turned it on in Pennsylvania this weekend. He kind
of carried it over into today."

Moved back onto a line with friends Judd Steele and Mike Murphy, Harshberger had
four assists as Beavercreek won this past weekend's Erie McDowell Invitational.

"Harshy" added two goals and an assist Tuesday night as Beavercreek improved to
9-1-1.

"It's a confidence thing, believing he's bigger than he is," Tramonte said. "The
light bulb went on for him this year. He's really flying now."

Harshberger, an assistant captain, had an assist on Murphy's goal in the game's
first minute. After Lee McClure scored the first of his two goals, Harshberger
scored two in a row to put Beavercreek up 4-0.

"He's a small kid," Alter coach Jack Collins said of Harshberger. "But he does
well."

The first-year Knights fell to 1-7. They put 27 shots on Beavercreek's Mike
Martin, who earned a shutout.

"We had some chances, but we have to start hitting the net more with our shots,"
Collins said. "We had a lot of shots go wide of the net."

Alter goalie Brian Klueber stopped 33 shots, many from point-blank range. "He
played well for us," Collins said. "It could have very well been a lot worse
than it was."

Beavercreek is off to its bestever start with its most talented players. But
Tramonte warned that the only true test was a 4-0 loss to Oxford Talawanda.

"It's too early to say it's the best (team)," Tramonte said. "We definitely have
the most talented players we've had. It remains to be seen what they can do
together.

"We haven't proven anything to anybody yet. We know that."

Since that loss, the Beavers are 5-0. "That really got us motivated,"
Harshberger said. "That made us want to work a lot harder."

The senior also has worked smarter, knowing opponents may try to get physical
with him.

"I don't really notice," he said. "I just keep my feet moving and just go around
them."

Alter moves on, Bellbrook falters;
Two-time state champs to face McNicholas

KETTERING - Volleyball teams from the Girls Greater Cincinnati League were a
smash Saturday in the Division II district championships.

Playing at the gleaming new Trent Arena at Fairmont High School, the
tradition-rich Catholic programs (GGCL Grey Division) swept the three matches.
The exclamation point came in the nightcap with Alter defeating Carroll 25-13,
25-16, 15-25, 25-16 to vault to the regionals Thursday at Wilmington high
School.

"Alter brings a lot of experience and they play high-intensity matches every
night in their league," said Carroll coach Yoon Ha. "They've been to the
district five or six straight years. This was our first time in six years. It
showed. We were tight those first two games."

Sarah Fisher served as the Knights' catalyst and played an impressive allcourt
game. She produced 12 kills, five blocks and four aces.

"We wanted to have a better outcome than last year when we lost to Benjamin
Logan in five games after winning the first two," Fisher said. "Most of us were
sophomores. We've progressed and we're a more balanced team and not built around
two players."

Setter supreme Kacie Hausfeld collected 41 assists, feeding Fisher, Katie
Laravie (11 kills), Emily Borchers (seven kills and four aces) and Lauren Woeste
(seven kills).

"Kacie recognized how hot Sarah was and got her the ball," said Alter coach Tina
Jasinowski. "Sometimes our girls are too nice, gratuitous and want to spread the
ball around. Kacie went to Sarah and kept pursuing her."

Two-time state champion Alter earned its fifth regional berth in the last six
years. The magical mystery tour continues against McNicholas who defeated Urbana
(25-21, 14-25, 25-22, 20-25, 15-9) in the opener.

"We've been a mystery at times," Jasinowski. "We have talent and that'll win you
the district, but from now we have to be mentally tougher and more focused as we
advance in the postseason. The ride will get tougher."

Leading Carroll (19-6), the fourtime defending Mid-Miami League North champs
were Gretchen Van Der Sluijs (14 kills and 16 digs), Stephanie Manns (eight
kills) and Linzie Evans (17 assists, four kills and three blocks). Evans and Van
Der Sluijs are headed to Youngstown State.

Formidable Cincinnati Roger Bacon swept Bellbrook 25-19, 25-16 and 25-8. The
Spartans showed why they are the top-ranked team in Ohio and No. 3 nationally on
PrepVolleyball.com. They were led by three future D-I players: Katie Veatch
(Kent State), Jaime Frey (Cincinnati) and Heather Hausfeld (Kentucky).

After a competive first game (25-19), the score was tied 11-11 when Bacon
grabbed the momentum and went on a 9-0 run and eventually won 25-16.

"We just got stuck in a bad rotation and they served us extremely tough," said
Bellbrook coach Jeanne Johnson, whose team ends with a impressive 20-5 record.
"I'm extremely proud of our girls. They gave me everything they had."

Keep an eye on Bellbrook junior Megan Smith who had some blistering kills and
was not intimidated by Bacon.

"Megan's going to be one of the premier outside hitters next season," Johnson
said. "She has a knack of surveying, finding the holes, swinging and putting it
down."

New owner to invest $ 400 million in Las Vegas resort site

BYLINE: By Howard Stutz

LENGTH: 926 words



Los Angeles financier Richard Alter once had designs on owning an upscale Strip
resort.

But instead of purchasing any Las Vegas Boulevard address, Alter discovered a
property where he could build a resort of the future, a little more than one
mile east of Las Vegas Boulevard.

Alter and his partner spent $ 62 million in May to purchase Alexis Park, a
nongaming hotel on Harmon Avenue. He acquired a property that not only needed
some cosmetic enhancements, but also an optimistic transfusion of ownership.

After paying another $ 8 million for a neighboring 206-unit apartment complex,
Alter put together the foundation for what he envisions as a 1,500-room resort
complex that will include a 28-story hotel tower, a 60,000-square-foot casino,
restaurants, a health spa and meeting space.

He plans to spend some $ 400 million to build his yet-to-be-named development by
2007.

For now, he is enhancing Alexis Park. The property is in the final stages of
modernizing the exterior facade, interior public area and grounds. The
furnishings in the resort's 500 suites are also being refreshed.

Alter will operate the hotel, now renamed Alexis Resort and Villas. He will also
bring gaming to the hotel for the first time since it opened in 1984, adding 15
slot machines to the property's new lounge area, once he gains Nevada gaming
authorities' approval.

"Our goal since 2001 has been to operate a Las Vegas resort," Alter said.

The global investment banking firm he manages, Financial Capital Investment Co.,
finished second to Planet Hollywood last year in bidding to purchase the
bankrupt Aladdin.

"We were hoping to find a property with a tremendous location that had unmet
potential," Alter said. "We found this with the Alexis Park. Our position
(across Harmon Avenue from the trendy Hard Rock Hotel) makes this an ideal
setting. In a few years, Harmon will have a lot of activity and seem much like a
second Las Vegas Strip."

The Hard Rock Hotel has announced plans for a $ 1 billion,
1.5-million-square-foot hotel-condominium project adjacent to its current
hotel-casino, and Alter said Alexis Resort would benefit from such an
investment. He said his customer demographic wouldn't skew as young as the
ultrahip Hard Rock crowd, although he does hope to attract patrons similar to
the audience at the Green Valley Ranch.

"I really like that property and I believe what we built here will have that
potential," he said.

Alter said the $ 400 million for his proposed complex will come from private
funds he and his business partner, Eddy Chao, will put up, and bank loans. Chao
is also his partner in Financial Capital Investment.

While completing plans for the proposed resort, noted architect Joel Bergman,
whose resume includes The Mirage, Treasure Island and Paris Las Vegas, is
designing the hotel tower and casino complex. Alter plans to not only run the
Alexis Resort, but also to merge the complex into the new property as exclusive
low-rise villas, similar to what once existed at many Strip properties in the
1970s.

Also, he'll serve as landlord for the apartment complex, where small units fetch
an average monthly rent of $ 600 each. The complex's 10 acres will be the site
for the planned hotel tower and casino space.

"While we go through the process to build our vision, we will manage the Alexis
Resort as a luxurious location for the Las Vegas visitor," Alter said. "And
we'll keep the apartment complex open for as long as we can before it is torn
down to make way for the new resort."

Once an upscale all-suite property that, despite lacking a casino, attracted a
high-end clientele, Alexis Park had fallen into disrepair. The hotel had once
hosted numerous showroom celebrities who stayed there, hoping to avoid crowds,
and were attracted by the property's lush environment and quiet nongaming
atmosphere.

The resort also included the Pegasus Room, one of Las Vegas' first-ever
four-star restaurants.

Years of neglect, however, took its toll.

The 375 Supper Club Lounge, a late-night dining and entertainment venue that
opened earlier this month in the space once occupied by the Pegasus, is expected
to include gaming. Alter said the property has applied for a restricted gaming
license and has contracted with a route operator to manage the 15 games.

The move to add gaming marks a distinct change in the Alexis Resort operation.
The casino in the proposed resort would probably include 1,500 slot machines and
a large table-games area.

"Las Vegas has a wealth of qualified gaming personnel and I'm sure we'll find
the perfect team to manage our casino," Alter said.

Current enhancements include painting the property's entire outside walls to a
more vibrant Mediterranean theme of oranges and reds. Also, a new digital
marquee facing Harmon Avenue will be added. Lobby upgrades will include an
enhanced main entrance featuring an exterior glass wall supported by cables.
And, the beds in the property's 500 suites are being replaced.

By the end of January, the original pool area is expected to reopen to feature a
sand beach, cabanas, fire pits, a bar and fiber-optic lighting.

"The upgrades we are making will help infuse new life to the property," Alter
said. "We have beautiful grounds here and we don't need to import any palm
trees. We want to create a look that lets people know what we plan to bring in
the future."

Alter takes title at Louisville

Silver doesn't glitter quite like gold, but that didn't matter to Alter High
School volleyball coach Tina Jasinowski.

Alter went 4-1 over two days at the Louisville Invitational in Kentucky and won
the Silver Division title Saturday. The tournament boasted an impressive 24-team
field, including the national No. 1 and No. 2 teams ranked by prepvolleyball.com
- St. Joseph's (Mo.) and Assumption (Ky.).

Alter lost its second match to Notre Dame (Ky.) in two games to get dropped to
the Silver Division. Based on tournament rules, teams with one loss in their
pool played in that division, while undefeated teams played in the Gold. The
Knights ran off three straight wins to take the division title.

Megan Courtney had nine kills and 14 assists in the final game over DuPont
Manuel (Ky.). Kelly Westerkamp had nine kills, two aces, 12 digs and two blocks.

"We regrouped and played some of the best volleyball we've played this year,"
Jasinowski said.

Alter had been 4-1, its only loss to Cincinnati Ursuline Academy, last year's
state Division I champion. Alter will be tested again Tuesday at home against
Fenwick, which played its way into the Gold Division consolation matches at the
Louisville tournament.

Alter tops the charts, again

The Alter High School football team has picked up where it left off in 2008 - at
the head of its class.

Ohio's defending Division IV champion has been voted the No. 1 D-IV squad by a
state panel of sports writers and broadcasters. The first of eight Associated
Press weekly polls was released on Monday night, Sept. 14.

With triumphs over Fairmont (47-21), Bellbrook (27-0) and St. John's College
High School of Washington, D.C. (27-12), the Knights have outscored opponents a
combined 101-33 for a 22.7 average margin of victory.

"It's nice to get that kind of recognition," Alter coach Ed Domsitz said. "It's
nice when people believe that your program is on that level. But it's subject to
proof every week."

Alter visits Hamilton Badin - ranked fourth in Division V - in a Greater
Catholic League showdown at Hamilton High School at 7:30 p.m. on Friday.

Coldwater and St. Henry anchor the Nos. 1-2 spots in the D-V poll, while Marion
Local opens at No. 2 in Division VI behind top-ranked Delphos St. John's.

While the Dayton area's "Big Three" of Centerville, Northmont and Wayne were
shut out of the Division I top 10, Tecumseh is locked in a tie with Cincinnati
Winton Woods at No. 8 in Division II.

Bellefontaine ranks ninth in Division III, while Thurgood Marshall checks in at
No. 5 in Division IV, four slots behind Alter. Anna joins the Division V party
at No. 8, giving the Miami Valley four of the top eight D-V squads in the state.

Alter grad brings back school's dance team;
Lancerettes provide another athletic activity without the commitment of other
full-time sports.

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-4

LENGTH: 510 words


KETTERING - In past decades, the award-winning Alter High School Lancerette
Dance Team was known for its sharp precision and fabulous kickline. Those days
are back.

Having two sons actively participating in Alter's soccer program for the past 7
years, Centerville resident, Alter graduate and former Lancerette Mary Lynn
(Miller) Dorow felt something was missing from Alter's extracurricular
activities.

"Alter has so many talented young ladies, but with the way sports have evolved,
athletes are only able to partake in one sport. I wanted to provide the ladies
with another option to participate on a professionally run dance team without
the added stress of numerous weekly practices," Dorow said.

Dorow brings a wealth of knowledge about dance teams dating back to when she was
5 years old and marched in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In addition, she
was a faculty member at Alter from 1985-1987. During that time she also coached
the Lancerette Dance Team.

She is currently the vice president of FJM Inc., her family's business, where
she has been employed for 25 years. FJM supplies uniforms and all accessories to
all aspects of the pageant activity. Dorow also runs 24 summer clinics across
the United States for dance lines, majorette lines, flags, rifles, drum majors
and student leaders. With the support of Alter's staff, Dorow met with the
freshman, sophomore and junior girls and explained her hope and vision for the
program. The goal of the program is to present entertaining performances during
several basketball and football games and to provide another point of pride for
the Alter community.

Today, the Lancerettes are 20 dedicated, hard-working, athletes, with very
little dance experience. They are a combination of Alter soccer, basketball,
track, cross country, swimming, diving, gymnastics, power lifting, bowling and
cheerleading athletes.

Dorow (known as Mrs. D by her team) said, "In order to get started, we needed to
raise some funds. We sent a letter explaining what we are trying to accomplish
to Alter's database of previous Lancerettes. Within a month, we had donations of
$2,500."

"Memories as a Lancerette are some of my best high school recollections. I am
just thrilled Mary Lynn has decided to bring them back," said former Lancerette
and Centerville resident Connie Laumann.

Dorow credited her assistant, Lauren Ballard, parental support and the desire of
the members of the team.

"I have girls and parents commenting to me daily they are sorry they didn't
participate this year. I'm anticipating a big turnout for the spring tryouts.
We're hoping to double in size next year."

The Lancerette's first performance will be at halftime of the Jan. 26 home
basketball game against Cincinnati La Salle.

Surfing icon Hobie Alter remembered

HIGHLIGHT: Family and friends gather at a golf course in Laguna Beach to
remember the waterman and inventor.


More than 500 people attended a memorial in Laguna Beach last week to honor
Hobie Alter, the man known for bringing surfing and sailing to the masses. He
was also remembered as a generous and kind family man and friend who was much
more than his inventions.

"Not much about him was usual," his daughter, Paula Alter, said. "He lived his
life and expressed himself on his own terms, and that's what allowed him to
create the magic he did."

A podium decorated with Hobie surfboards and a Hobie Cat sailboat set the scene
at Aliso Creek Inn and Golf Course, where deer roamed around the gathering. Old
Woodies were parked on the course, and a big display showcased Alter's life's
work - from being first to use foam with surfboards to his skateboard and glider
inventions, and of course, his contribution to sailing, the Hobie Cat.

"We owe a lot of fun to him," Australian-born surfing Hall of Famer Peter "PT"
Townend said.

It was the first of two memorial ceremonies for Alter. Townend, surfing's first
world champion, said a paddle-out this Friday at Doheny State Beach could be the
largest in history.

Through Thursday's memorial, friends and family shared fond memories. Jimmie
Lomas said he walked into the Hobie shop in 1954, and Alter told him to start
sweeping the floors.

"I was Hobie's first employee," Lomas said. "It was quite a ride."

Alter has a rich history in Orange County. He started shaping boards in his
parents' Laguna Beach summer home in the early '50s - using the usual heavy
balsa wood. He teamed with Gordon "Grubby" Clark to develop polyurethane foam as
a substitute for the core of a surfboard in the late '50s. Their lighter,
faster, less-expensive alternative revolutionized the sport.

The invention invited more people to take up the pastime, as the craze
paralleled the mainstream success of the "Gidget" franchise. The same technology
is used in most surfboards built today.

In 1954, Alter opened a custom surfboard factory and showroom in Dana Point and
was the first to develop a removable fin, making shipping and transport easier.

In the late '60s, Alter switched his focus in the water and started designing
sailboats - specifically smaller boats that were affordable at $999. No longer
did a boat owner need to belong to a yacht club or own a slip to enjoy the
water; the boats could be launched from the beach.

The Hobie Cat became known as "the people's boat" and still is the world's
best-selling catamaran, according to the company's website.

Friday's memorial will begin about 4:30 p.m. Doheny State Beach officials are
letting memorial attendees park for free.

USA Surf Team gets copper

The USA Surf Team - including many Orange County surfers - earned a copper medal
during the VISSLA ISA World Junior Surfing Championship in Ecuador last Sunday,
after a week of competition against 32 teams from around the world.

Waves were in the 6-8-foot range for the final day, providing perfect conditions
for competition. The team from Hawaii was unbeatable, dominating on the final
day as it clinched gold. Hawaii earned 21,168 points, France came in second and
Australia third. Team USA tallied 18,418 for fourth spot. Four mainland
Americans got medals, including two from San Clemente.

"The team was amazing; all the kids just jelled," said Greg Cruse, executive
director of the USA surf team.

"There was kind of a mini-miracle to get that many into the final, the kids were
surfing out of their skin."

The San Clemente surfers who medaled were Tia Blanco, who got a bronze in the
girls under-18 division, and Griffin Colapinto, who earned a a copper medal.

"The whole attitude of the team was amazing. Next year we'll get gold," Cruse
said.

Alter boys climb back atop D-II poll

LENGTH: 445 words


Two days after losing its edge, the Alter boys soccer team got it back.

The Knights, who lost 1-0 to Centerville last Thursday, upended Carroll 3-0 on
Saturday. The Knights were 1-3-1 against the Patriots since 2003, including
back-to-back losses in the last two D-II district finals.

"You can't say we're afraid to play anybody," Alter coach Bob Ellis said.

With the convincing win over Carroll, Alter maintained its top ranking in the
D-II area coaches poll and was No. 6 in the state poll for the second straight
week. The Knights added a victory over Cincinnati Purcell-Marian on Tuesday to
improve to 5-1-1 heading into Thursday's game with Cin. LaSalle.

Entering Thursday's game, Alter had outscored its opponents 26-5 with three
shutouts. Those are solid numbers considering Alter's opponents sport a combined
34-18-7 record.

Rams tough

Think Greeneview's girls were ready to take on Northwestern, then ranked No. 7
in the state in Division II? The Rams dented the net three times in the first 15
minutes in a 3-2 win last Saturday. Senior Rebecca Strickland had a goal and an
assist and freshman Alexis Mickle had two assists.

Greeneview coach Dan Ludwick said the Rams didn't put any extra emphasis on the
game. Instead, he's telling his players to focus on improving from game to game.

"While the win over Northwestern is big," Ludwick said, "we need to put the game
in the past and get back to business because we have nine more regular season
games to play."

Entering the week, Mickle led the Rams (6-1) with eight goals. Strickland had
six and Tracy Barnhart four. Jordan Price leads with five assists and keeper
Stephanie McBride has 31 saves and four shutouts.

Irish eyes are smiling

Winning 300 career games was special enough for Springfield Catholic Central
coach Shane Latham. But the night took on added meaning when his son, Stefan,
scored twice in the 4-1 win over Greeneview on Tuesday. Latham, in his 21st
season with the Irish, is the 11th coach in state history to reach that mark.
He's 91 wins behind all-time leader Tom Mackar.

Goal oriented

Ridgeville Christian junior Paul Schindler has provided the soccer team with net
gains. According to the Ohio Soccer Stats Web site, Schindler leads the state in
scoring in D-III with a school-record 22 goals. He's second in the state
overall, trailing Oak Harbor's Nic Kleman (26). Ridgeville Christian is off to a
7-1-1 start, its best in school history.

RC, which has outscored opponents 49-7 with four shutouts, gets a major test
Saturday against Dayton Christian (No. 3 in D-III of the Miami Valley Scholastic
Coaches Association poll).

In Politics, Residency Prompts Scrutiny

LENGTH: 855 words


New York City politicians are carefully gauging the political impact of
accusations that three City Council members do not live in the districts they
represent, with rivals hoping to gain an advantage from the controversy and at
least one party leader seeking a potential replacement for a politically wounded
Councilman.

Last week, the Bronx District Attorney's office said it was investigating
allegations that Rafael Castaneira Colon and Israel Ruiz Jr., both Democratic
Council members from the Bronx, provided false information about where they
live. And articles last week in Newsday raised anew questions about Susan D.
Alter, the Democratic Council member from Brooklyn running for Public Advocate
on both the Democratic and Republican tickets, suggesting that Ms. Alter
actually lives on Long Island.

Mr. Ruiz and Ms. Alter have vigorously denied the charges; Mr. Colon has not
uttered a word publicly.

Fallout Being Felt

But the fallout from the charges is already being felt. The Democratic Party
leader in the Bronx, Assemblyman George Friedman, has begun looking for
potential candidates to contest Mr. Colon's seat in the primary election in
September. Mr. Friedman said that the troubles of Mr. Colon -- who was also
arrested two weeks ago and charged with assaulting a woman over a dispute about
support payments for their child -- have made the Councilman particularly
vulnerable.

"He is in a lot of trouble if he plans to run again," Mr. Friedman said. "It
appears rather unlikely that he would be able to mount a successful reelection
effort because of all the adverse publicity he has received."

In the crowded field of candidates for Public Advocate -- as the post now known
as City Council President will be retitled next year -- some hopefuls said they
will seek to gain political mileage by focusing attention on the fact that Ms.
Alter spends at least some of her time at a home in Lawrence, L.I. Two
candidates, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they expected the issue to
play a role in the campaign.

"It may very well be that she can establish that she legitimately lives in
Brooklyn," said one candidate. "But I don't think her shuttling back and forth
between Brooklyn and Long Island will look good to the voters."

Hoping to Tarnish Giuliani

Ms. Alter is also running for Public Advocate on the Republican ticket led by
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate. Many Democratic
leaders said they hope the residency issue will somehow tarnish the image of Mr.
Giuliani for having picked Ms. Alter.

Ms. Alter's colleagues have known for years that she has a house in her Brooklyn
district and that her husband lived and worked on Long Island. Ms. Alter has
maintained that her husband, Rabbi Gilbert Klaperman, has a home provided to him
by his synagogue in Lawrence, but that it functions primarily as a summer and
occasional weekend home and that she actually lives in Brooklyn.

Of course, officials may own as many homes as they like and spend as much time
as they please outside of their districts. But under New York state law, a
candidate must reside in the district he hopes to represent. A candidate can
prove residency by a variety of circumstantial evidence, including voter
registration information, insurance data, and telephone and utility bills, for
example.

But because of the expansion of the City Council from 35 to 51 members in 1991,
a Federal court decision in 1991 temporarily suspended the state residency law
for Council candidates. The judge ruled that, for the election of November 1991,
a candidate would be allowed to run in any district regardless of residency, as
long as the candidate lived in New York City.

That exemption does not apply this year, and by June 8 candidates are required
to live in whatever district they plan to represent.

Some Anxiety

While legally Mr. Colon and Mr. Ruiz were not required to live in their
districts during the current term, published reports have raised questions about
whether they lied about their residency in filing their election papers two
years ago. Those accusations are being examined by the Bronx District Attorney
and, in the case of Mr. Colon, by the City Council's ethics committee.

Residency has been an issue for members of the City Council at several points
through the years. Most recently, Lucy Cruz, a Democratic Council member from
the Bronx, was investigated last year by the Bronx District Attorney after
allegations that she did not live in the district. The District Attorney
concluded that the accusations were unfounded.

If nothing else, the issue has some Council members a little nervous. Peter F.
Vallone, the Council Speaker, said that several members had approached him with
questions about whether their summer homes or additional residences might place
them, too, under scrutiny.

"For the most part, they don't have anything to worry about," Mr. Vallone said.
"But I always tell them that they've got to be truthful about it. As long as you
tell the truth to the people you represent, you should have nothing to worry
about."

Detroit's Dirty Dozen

BYLINE: Eric Shinn, Toronto Star ; Andrew Stawicki/TORONTO STAR

SECTION: ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 838 words

HIGHLIGHT:
Eminem's crew takes his absence in stride at New Muziq festival

D10. That's all Toronto got Sunday night, as Eminem's Detroit crew The Dirty
Dozen (a.k.a. D12) rolled into Toronto for a gig at Kool Haus without him and
his alter-ego Slim Shady.

Already on two years probation for a weapons charge, late last week Eminem was
sentenced to another year for pulling a gun on rival Detroit rap group Insane
Clown Posse outside a club in a Detroit suburb last June.

D12 took his absence in stride, as they're trying to balance the benefits of
Eminem affiliation with the need to come up with an original style of their own.

Featuring Rufus Johnson, a.k.a. MC Bizarre (alter-ego "Peter S. Bizarre"),
Denaun Porter, a.k.a. MC Kon Artis (alter-ego "Mr. Denaun Porter"), DeShaun
Holton, a.k.a. MC Proof (alter-ego "Derty Hairy"), Von Carlisle, a.k.a. MC
Kuniva (alter-ego "Rondell Beene") and Ondre Moore, a.k.a. MC Swift (alter-ego
"Swifty McVay"), the quintet appeared on stage with producer DJ Head as part of
the New Muziq festival, which attracted about 4,000 of an anticipated 8,000
crowd to the Kool Haus-Guvernment nightclub complex, according to venue staff.

The alter-egos are required not only because hip hop seems to be borrowing from
the epic excesses of glam rock these days, but, as MC Bizarre explained while
giggling and eating several burgers in the Metropolitan Hotel lobby before the
show, the key to success is to slowly morph into an exaggerated version of
yourself:

"Becoming your alter-ego is just life. Everybody has an alter-ego. We've done
four tours now, and the more touring the more fun we're having."

Also on the bill were DJ performances by veteran hip hop-drum and bass DJs
Freaky Flow and Aphrodite, as well as a team turntablism display by the Funky
Technicianz, whose DJ Junior Flow defeated defending Toronto DMC champ DJ Dopey
of the Turntable Monks for the title of best turntablist on Friday at the Opera
House.

Following an intro from recent Shady Records signee and D12 album guest Obie
Trice, who riled up the crowd with aggressive rhymes over pounding beats
provided by DJ Head, D12 members took the stage one by one in front of a massive
banner bearing their gothic-inspired logo.

Beginning with a profanity-laced debut track off their platinum-selling first
album Devil's Night, currently number one in Canada, their performance was a
highlight reel of tired gangsta rap cliches masquerading as intelligent social
commentary.

Whether calling out for the audience to shoot their fingers in the air during
their gun-ode "Pistol Pistol," or asking everybody to put their hands in the air
"if they've swallowed a pill tonight" before launching into their ecstasy
tribute "Purple Pills," D12 were in fine degenerate form, even bringing a guy
out on stage wearing a six-foot diameter ecstasy pill costume.

Says MC Proof in defence of their rude style, "We're just a reflection of the
world around us and people always say 'Oh, you're so controversial. ...We just
talk about what people are scared to talk about."

What crowd was left by the time D12 took the stage an hour late at around 2: 30
a.m. - about 1,000 tired ravers - seemed to have no fear singing along.

Hips were shaking raunchily to their misogynistic "Pimp Like Me," feet were
jumping to the uppity "Fight Music."

The crowd-pleaser had to be "Purple Pills," though, which earned audience
familiarity due to major radio play and heavy rotation on MuchMusic, despite an
edited and renamed video featuring the group romping through rolling landscape
with saturated Telletubbies colours, called "Purple Hills."

MC Bizarre appealed to the crowd's sense of timeless youth rebellion before
kicking off the group's "Ain't Nuttin' But Music," asking for cheers from
anybody who didn't want to live their life like their parents. Compared to the
quality socially progressive underground hip hop Toronto supports locally, and
from hotbeds like San Francisco and New York, it was a surprise anybody found
this call to arms remotely inspiring.

When asked earlier in the day whether D12 are wary of becoming mainstream after
six years paying their dues at open mic sessions and on indie EPs in the
transient local Detroit scene, MC Proof said the goal is to sell out as
effectively as possible, and that the underground isn't as underground as it
purports to be:

"We're trying to be included in the machine, which is the industry. Underground
is untapped. Untapped would be Idaho. That would be underground. If you were
from Idaho and you were into hip hop, I'd be like, 'damn.' New York is one of
the most exposed cities - how can it truly be underground?"

But did Toronto fans buy their schtick? At the show's conclusion, members of D12
perused the crowd for hot ladies, asking "single honeys who ain't got no curfew
to come backstage."

When they asked their bodyguards to pick up several women identified as suitable
post-show flings, all the ladies refused.

Better practise your pimpin' before you roll through Toronto again on the Warped
Tour in August, D12.

Alter farm nourished many family memories

BYLINE: Liz Hayes

LENGTH: 399 words


At one time, the Alter farm was a 500-acre operation in Allegheny County.
Started in 1806 by a couple who walked 185 miles from Juniata County to the
Pittsburgh area on their honeymoon, the farm produced crops and history.

It's stayed in the family over two centuries despite being bisected by Route 28,
parcels being sold off for development and farming operations coming to an end.

About 35 descendants gathered Sunday to celebrate the farm's place in local
history.

Washington Beale and his bride, Jane Given Beale, came west to settle a 200-acre
tract near what is now the intersection of Route 908 and Alter Road in
northeastern Allegheny County.

"They walked all that way on what would have been their honeymoon trip," said
descendant Reid Stewart, a Lower Burrell minister and historian.

The land passed to the Beales' 10th child, Nancy Jane, and her husband, Samuel
Alter, in the 1850s and became known as the Alter farm.

The couple played host to the first family reunion in 1888. Yesterday's
gathering was the fifth -- and the first since 1945.

"They're not annual events by any means," Stewart said.

Nancy Gulliford and her cousin, Kathleen Collins, both descendants of the Alters
, said they realized by chance that 2006 was the 200th anniversary of their
ancestors' arrival in Allegheny County and decided it would be the perfect time
to round up the family for a picnic.

The relatives gathered at Gulliford's home along Alter Road, in the middle of
the former farmland.

The Alter farm at one point probably boasted more than 500 acres, Stewart said,
but parcels slowly were subdivided and some passed out of the family. Little
farming occurs in the area now, Gulliford said.

There is no trace of the original log house built by Washington Beale in 1815,
and Beale's second home burned down. But Samuel Alter's farmhouse, built in
1876, still exists and remains in the family -- Collins lives there with her
children, Alexander and Elizabeth Yokoh, and her mother, Louise Collins.

"They had to move the house when they built the expressway in the 1970s,"
Gulliford said. "Route 28 cuts right through the farm."

"The barn was under the present Route 28," Stewart added.

Those gathered yesterday at Gulliford's home passed around booklets containing a
photo of the farmhouse during the 1888 family reunion, complete with dozens of
relatives sprawled out on its lawn and many porches.

Alter to welcome 9 into Hall;
Graduates, coach to be honored Jan. 28 in Kettering

BYLINE: By Helen Bebbington For the Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SOUTHWEST; Pg. Z8-10

LENGTH: 961 words


KETTERING - Alter High School alumni being honored this year include a doctor
who flies on humanitarian missions, a priest who serves the poor and a
serviceman who died in the line of duty.

The Alter High School Alumni Hall of Fame will induct nine people, eight
graduates and a former coach, at a ceremony Jan. 28 at the Presidential Banquet
Center in Kettering.

The inductees are:

Dr. Michael Kunesh

Kunesh, a 1978 Alter graduate, attended the University of Notre Dame, where he
earned degrees in biology and theology.

He earned a medical degree and did training in ophthalmology at Ohio State
University. His practice specializes in cataract and glaucoma surgery.

The Oakwood resident has been a member of Alter's education commission and of
the St. Leonard's parish council.

Kunesh uses his skills to help others in poor countries.

He has visited Malawi in Africa to perform eye surgeries and to treat blindness
and has gone on medical missions to Honduras, China, Taiwan and Jamaica.

Of late, he has been focusing on helping children orphaned by the AIDS epidemic
in Africa.

Kunesh learned about service at school and has made it part of his life.

"I'm an example of what Alter is about," Kunesh said. "Alter is about educating
not just about facts, but educating about values. One of the values that they
educated me in is the value of service."

The Rev. Mark R. Soehner

Soehner, a 1976 graduate, has served the poor in Cincinnati and Detroit, and
once managed the St. Vincent Hotel in Dayton.

Soehner earned a bachelor's degree in English from Mercy College of Detroit in
1980, then joined the Franciscan Friars of the St. John the Baptist Province in
Cincinnati.

In 1987, he completed a master's degree in divinity at Chicago's Catholic
Theological Union and was ordained a priest.

In 1993, he earned a master's degree in pastoral counseling.

Soehner has taught English to immigrants and has provided pastoral counseling to
families at hospitals and to juveniles in detention.

At the University of Cincinnati he coordinated pastoral and sacramental care of
students, faculty and parishioners.

In Dayton, he managed the St. Vincent Hotel. In Detroit, he founded a shelter
that serves 1,900 homeless people a week.

In 2003, he helped found a similar program for the homeless called Oasis
Detroit.

In 1995, Soehner became pastor of St. Aloysius Church in Detroit, where he works
as a counselor and spiritual director.

Later this year, he is expected to become pastor for three innercity parishes.

Jill Reiling Markey

Markey, class of 1974, earned a bachelor's degree in studio art at the
University of Kentucky, a master's degree in visual art from the University of
Dayton and a doctorate in art education at Ohio State University.

Markey teaches art at Instructional Technology Services in Columbus and is a
member of the Ohio Alliance for Arts Education.

She served as president of the Ohio Art Education Association for two years.

Markey, who has won numerous awards, has been an exhibiting artist at the
Columbus Cultural Arts Center.

Sgt. Kevin Joseph Lannon

Lannon, who graduated in 1980, was a medic for the U.S. Army Rangers when he was
killed in the line of duty in 1983.

Lannon died while participating in a rescue mission in Grenada.

He and his fellow servicemen were trying to rescue American medical students.

A helicopter he was riding in was hit by small arms fire, killing him. Lannon
received the Bronze Star for his service.

Dr. Julie Schaefer Myers

Myers, who graduated in 1980, played basketball for four years at Alter, earning
three varsity letters.

She was named a three-time all-conference and all-area player. In her senior
year she was allarea MVP, district player of the year and first-team all-state.

She also earned varsity letters in volleyball and softball.

Myers was awarded a basketball scholarship to the University of Dayton, where
she earned four varsity letters and more awards.

She graduated from UD in 1984, then earned a medical degree from Ohio
University.

The Miamisburg resident practices medicine in Kettering.

Jim Stangle

Stangle, a member of Alter's first graduating class of 1966, was a tackle on
both offense and defense for the Knights' football team.

He was co-captain of the team as a junior and senior.

Stangle attended the University of Dayton on an athletic scholarship. Stangle
earned a bachelor's degree from UD in 1970, when he was commissioned as a second
lieutenant in the Army. He later earned a master's degree in business from UD.
Stangle is general manager for Cintas in the Baltimore metro market.

Nancy Janco-Budde

Janco-Budde, a 1974 graduate, earned varsity letters in tennis, track,
basketball and volleyball at Alter.

She played women's tennis at Arizona State University, graduating in 1979.

Alter tops defending state champs;
McCarthy scores in OT to lead the Knights over Bexley, 1-0.

CLAYTON - Eighty minutes of tough, hard-fought soccer resulted in a scoreless
regulation for Alter High School and Columbus Bexley in the boys Division II
state semifinals on Tuesday. Alter didn't wait nearly as long to score in
overtime.

Battling for a trip to the D-II state championship game, the Knights put the
sudden in sudden victory by scoring 1 minute, 22 seconds into overtime. The 1-0
win over the defending state champs stunned the Lions and left Alter coach Bob
Ellis in tears discussing it in front of about 1,000 spectators at Northmont
High School.

"I'm in shock. I'll be honest with you. I never thought we'd have this
opportunity again," Ellis said of Alter's sixth state championship appearance.

Alter (18-2-1) plays the winner of Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit (19-2-0) and Bay
Village Bay (20-1-0) for the state title at 11 a.m. Saturday at Crew Stadium in
Columbus. The Knights are 3-2 in title games.

Neither team could capitalize on quality chances through regulation.
Unofficially, both Alter and Bexley (18-2-2) finished with eight shots. Alter
junior Danny McCarthy needed just one in overtime. Sneaking behind the lone
Bexley defender, McCarthy took Dan Biga's pass from the far sideline and rolled
it inside the left post for the winner.

"I was getting in position behind the (Bexley) guy so he couldn't see me,"
McCarthy said. "The ball was put right behind the defender. He didn't see me. I
just stepped up and said in my mind, 'I gotta put this in.' "

Biga said he felt the same way about the pass, a perfectly placed ball that the
defender didn't have a chance at. "I just put it in the space, and McCarthy
finished the ball," said Biga. "That's what he's good at. That's his job. He did
fantastic work."

BYLINE: DAVE LAMB HERE AND THERE

SECTION: CENTERVILLE BELLBROOK; Pg. Z2-8

LENGTH: 673 words


Two decades after they won Alter High School's first state soccer championship
in dramatic fashion, the 1987 boys' team has once again earned the spotlight.

That team, along with acclaimed athletes Andrea D'Innocenzo, Theresa Yingling
Plunkett and Jerry Rudzinski, will be inducted into Alter's Athletic Hall of
Fame on Friday at the Presidential Banquet Center in Kettering.

Alter also will honor distinguished alumni Dr. Mark Romer, Dr. Annette Chavez
and Diane Butler-Hughes. Lois Ulrich, former longtime Lancerette director, also
will be recognized.

The 1987 soccer team won the state Class AAA title, 2-1, over Stow Walsh Jesuit,
with Tom Muzechuck's goal with 93 seconds remaining in the title match.

In the semifinals, Alter defeated Wayne, 1-0, on a goal by Ore Mahoney, with
Terry Graham providing the assist.

The Knights posted 17 shutouts in a 21-3-2 season. They outscored opponents 16-2
in eight tournament games, six of them shutout wins with Ben Pickrel in goal.

* Andrea D'Innocenzo, a 1992 graduate, earned 10 varsity letters in soccer,
basketball and softball.

She earned her greatest acclaim in softball, earning All-America honors and
playing in the College World Series at the University of Connecticut.

D'Innocenzo played four years in the Women's Professional Softball League and
was a two-time all-star.

She also played a professional season in Parma, Italy.

* Theresa Yingling Plunkett, a 1982 graduate, was an All-Ohio basketball player
and a state qualifier in the long jump.

She became the second Alter basketball player to reach 1,000 points and stands
fifth on the career scoring list at the University of Dayton.

* Jerry Rudzinski, a 1994 graduate, was a two-time All-Ohio football player who
became a standout linebacker at Ohio State.

At Alter, Rudzinski was named AP Ohio defensive player of the year. He was also
a three-year letterman in basketball, and helped the Knights reach the Final
Four.

A three-year starter at linebacker at Ohio State, Rudzinski served as captain in
1998.

In addition to helping the Buckeyes reached No. 2 nationally in two seasons,
Rudzinski was a two-time GTE Academic All-American and selected as the football
team's most inspirational senior.

Alter's Conservatory for the Arts spotlights students' talents;
Program is aimed at students wanting a career in the arts

BYLINE: By Jeremy P. Kelley Staff Writer

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD1

LENGTH: 332 words


KETTERING - Halfway through the first year of its Conservatory for the Arts
program, Alter High School celebrated its students' work Dec. 8 at the annual
Fine Arts Assembly.

The 12 members of Alter's A Sharp a capella choir performed two songs for the
student body, followed by a display of sketches, paintings, sculpture and video
from about 100 of the school's visual artists, accompanied on piano by freshman
Andy Catá. There also was a performance from Alter's band, which last month
qualified for the Grand Nationals in Indianapolis.

While a larger number of Alter students take individual art, music and theater
classes, about 50 have entered the school's Conservatory program, which is new
this year. To earn Alter's Conservatory Diploma, students must take four credits
of fine arts, review an off-campus arts event each year, shadow a professional
in their desired field, pursue private lessons and make a senior
presentation/recital.

"The arts are a very difficult career to go into, especially as an independent
artist," Alter theater teacher Katie Arber said. "This gives them that
particular focus to really differentiate whether they can do it professionally,
and they're getting (training and referrals) to be the best they can be."

Catá said the Conservatory structure makes it easier on students.

"I had always been involved in arts and played piano, and I kind of worried what
I was going to do (at Alter)," Catá said. "This program has given me an answer.
This is a way to capitalize on that while still going to the school I really
wanted to go to."

Senior Amy Minham, who hopes to pursue visual arts in college, wishes she had
had the Conservatory option as a freshman.

"Sports usually get the most attention at Alter, and art and band are kind of
like, 'Hey, we're over here,' " Minham said. "I really like the Conservatory
because it is encouraging to students and the arts are definitely being
supported."

Knights, coach extend success;
Alter meets Aiken in D-II tournament at Trent Arena.;
TODAY'S GAMES

SECTION: ; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 346 words


Alter has a 26-2 record all-time in district finals and is the last area team
remaining in the D-II tournament. Alter plays Aiken tonight.

Alter boys basketball coach Eric Coulter has a tendency to get nostalgic when
reflecting on the Knights' success. As an assistant to Alter coaching fixture
Joe Petrocelli, Coulter was part of three teams that advanced to state final
fours and won a state title.

In his third season Coulter is making his own legacy. The Knights are the last
area team in the Division II tournament field. Alter (18-6) will play Aiken
(22-3) in a D-II regional semifinal at 8:30 p.m. today at Fairmont's Trent Area.

"It's unreal," Coulter admitted after Alter rallied to stun Carroll 47-42 in
last Sunday's D-II district final at UD Arena. "I've been with Petro for a lot
of stuff. This is my first (district title) as a head coach. Petro had like 25
of them."

Coulter is correct about that. Alter is 26-2 all-time in district finals, all
but one under Petro's watch.

The Alter/Aiken start time was moved back 30 minutes to accommodate Alter fans
who also might attend the Knights' D-II girls state semifinal at 6 p.m. in
Columbus. Aiken advanced by defeating Urbana 67-55 in another district final.

Alter is led in scoring by senior Joey Laravie (16.2 points) and his cousin,
junior Dominic Lara-vie (15.2). They also were 1-2 in Greater Catholic League

One Campaign by Alter: Many Interpretations

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

SECTION: Section 1; Page 27; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1093 words


On a recent Sunday morning, the Rev. Clarence A. Norman Sr. faced the members of
his church -- one of the largest black congregations in Brooklyn -- and
introduced his choice for Public Advocate. "I'm not telling you what to do,"
said the minister, ending a somewhat tepid endorsement of Susan D. Alter, who is
running for the post that is replacing the job of City Council President. "But I
consider her a friend."

As Ms. Alter stood at the pulpit, praising the minister "for his courage," many
in the congregation seemed impressed with the white, red-haired woman who talked
with passion about "the brotherhood of man." But some were not, notably the
pastor's son, Clarence A. Norman Jr., the state Assemblyman and Brooklyn
Democratic leader who sat fuming at the sight of the woman who had crossed party
lines in an alliance with Republican mayoral candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani.

The scene underscores not only how controversial Ms. Alter's candidacy has
become but also how her bid to run for Public Advocate on the Democratic and
Republican lines is subject to a number of interpretations.

Concern for the Young and Old

Supporters, like the senior Mr. Norman, see Ms. Alter, a City Council member, as
a politician with a genuine concern for helping both young and elderly people;
someone eager to find ways of creating bridges between the city's ethnic groups.
In particular, he credits her with helping him obtain money to develop a center
for the elderly at his church, which is not in Ms. Alter's Council district.

Others, like his son, see her as a disloyal Democrat and an undistinguished
legislator who has joined with Mr. Giuliani out of vengeance toward Mayor David
N. Dinkins in a last gasp to salvage a political career whose days were
numbered.

But if nothing else, she is a politician on whom labels do not affix easily. She
is an orthodox Jew who represents an overwhelmingly black, Protestant district
in Brooklyn. She is a lifelong Democrat and was an early supporter of Mr.
Dinkins four years ago, but who now says she has become so disillusioned with
New York's first black mayor that she has cast her lot with the Republicans.

In joining Mr. Giuliani, she has taken on what is surely the boldest move of her
political career. Some experts suggest that her chances of being elected are
slim, contending that she is unlikely to beat better known opponents, like
Andrew J. Stein and Mark Green. The Public Advocate succeeds the Mayor if he
dies in office and has wide freedom to examine different agencies, expose
problems and propose policies. The job pays $105,000 a year.

'It Saddens Me'

Ms. Alter views her defection to Mr. Giuliani and the Republican ticket as the
end result of a painful process of watching Mr. Dinkins become ineffective. "I
supported David Dinkins and worked hard for him," she said. "But I have seen him
as Mayor, and he has not offered much leadership. It saddens me."

Ms. Alter complains that Mr. Dinkins has not responded to the needs of
lower-income communities -- like her district in central Brooklyn -- for more
day-care slots and assistance with health care. "I thought that, because of his
background, he would be sensitive to the needs of women, immigrants and
children. But he has been a disappointment."

Others who know her characterize her political marriage with Mr. Giuliani as one
motivated by vengeance. She feels scorned by the Mayor, critics suggest, because
Mr. Dinkins supported Representative Edolphus Towns over Ms. Alter in a race for
Congress three years ago. Further, critics contend, she blames the Mayor for a
redistricting effort two years ago that was intended to create a predominantly
black district and that nearly resulted in her neighborhood being placed in
another district.

The 1991 redistricting resulted in a series of lawsuits. In the compromise with
the Mayor, Ms. Alter was allowed to run in her 45th Council District, which
includes parts Flatbush and East Flatbush, although her home is a few blocks
outside of that area.

"I think she was really irritated by the Mayor," said Norman Adler, a political
consultant who is an unpaid adviser to State Senator David A. Paterson, one of
Ms. Alter's many opponents in the race for Public Advocate. "She was looking for
a level of standing with the Mayor that she didn't get and felt scorned."

Ms. Alter said she was preparing to run for re-election to the Council when she
received a call from David Garth, the political strategist, who is working for
Mr. Giuliani, asking her to join the ticket as a Republican. "I felt it was an
opportunity for me to do something courageous," she said.

Her alliance with Mr. Giuliani is viewed by many as an appeal to conservative
and Jewish voters. And many politicians have accused Mr. Giuliani of using her
to attack the Mayor and to take on racially charged issues, allowing Mr.
Giuliani to appear more like a statesman.

"I resent being described as the pit bull of the ticket," Ms. Alter said. "My
job is not to pick on the Mayor. I will let Rudy take him on. My role is to be
elected Public Advocate and take my own message to the people."

Her message can vary sharply from one location to another. In a meeting of
Republican Party leaders, for example, she spoke wistfully of how "so many of us
don't feel part of the gorgeous mosaic the Mayor talks about," and how Mr.
Giuliani offers the best opportunity for New Yorkers -- particularly "those of
us who have felt alienated" -- to be treated fairly.

On the other hand, at Mr. Norman's pulpit -- at the First Baptist Church of
Crown Heights -- she uttered neither Mr. Giuliani's name nor the fact that she
was running to be both the Republican and Democratic nominee for Public
Advocate. She spoke instead of the need for all races "to work together to make
a better New York."

Although Ms. Alter has been on the Council since 1978, she is barely known
outside of the Brooklyn neighborhoods she has represented. Also, in a city in
which candidates often spend hundreds of thousands of dollars running for
citywide offices, Ms. Alter said she has so far raised about $50,000. Further,
she has received no major endorsements -- except that of Mr. Norman -- and has
only a thin organization of supporters.

Still she seems undaunted. "After what I've gone through in the redistricting
commission, the suits and challenge of being a white candidate in a minority
district, I'm certainly ready for this. I went through hellfire to keep my
district and to keep my head up while keeping it."

Alter Crosses Party Lines to Back Giuliani for Mayor

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

SECTION: Section 1; Page 23; Column 3; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 856 words


Creating what he called a "multiparty fusion movement" to bring together
disparate political and racial groups in New York City, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, reached across party lines yesterday to
introduce Susan D. Alter, a Democratic councilwoman from Brooklyn, as his choice
for City Council president.

Ms. Alter, a 14-year veteran of the City Council, used their joint news
conference to announce her bid to be the Council's president, a position to be
renamed public advocate. She said her decision to join the Giuliani camp had
evolved in the last several weeks and her political defection had caused her a
minimum of Angst. "It was easier than I would have liked it to have been," she
said.

Badillo Vacillates

The announcement, made at a news conference yesterday morning at Mr. Giuliani's
campaign headquarters on Lexington Avenue, came as Herman Badillo, another
Democrat and Mr. Giuliani's choice for comptroller, continued to dodge questions
about his possible move to join the Giuliani slate. Shortly after Ms. Alter's
announcement, Mr. Badillo, speaking at a luncheon at the City Club of New York,
repeated that he had not decided whether to accept Mr. Giuliani's offer. "I
haven't decided," he said. "And I am not likely to decide for some time."

Several senior advisers to Mr. Giuliani described Mr. Badillo's hesitation as
driven by concern over his credibility within his own party. "It goes back and
forth," an adviser said of Mr. Badillo's addition to the ticket. "He'd like to.
We want him. We want them together. We're still talking, as crazy as it sounds.
He's getting a lot of pressure from the Democrats, too."

Ms. Alter admitted to no such indecision. Instead, speaking beneath two of her
posters, Ms. Alter said she had not even consulted Mayor David N. Dinkins and
described her decision as motivated more by philosophy than politics.

She described her distress over Mayor Dinkins's stewardship. Though she stopped
short of any direct criticism of the Mayor, she said that he had lost her
support because of what she termed his weak handling of such racially sensitive
incidents as the upheaval in Crown Heights in 1991 "and the rancor that took
place" in its wake.

Mayor Dinkins yesterday responded to the defection with disappointment. Though
he dismissed the notion that she would be an important addition to a citywide
ticket, he said that he regretted Ms. Alter's decision because she was aligning
herself with a party that had slashed New York City funds for 12 years under
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. He also criticized Republicans in the
Senate for choking off funds for summer jobs for city youths. "These are the
persons with whom she has chosen to align herself," Mr. Dinkins said. "I think
it's very unfortunate."

The Republicans feel that Ms. Alter's own background , however, gives them one
clear advantage. Since she was able, as a City Council member, to appeal to
conservative white voters in the Borough Park, Bensonhurst and Flatbush areas of
Brooklyn, and then to appeal to blacks after her district was significantly
redrawn through redistricting in 1981, they feel she is in a position to
challenge the Mayor's record on race.  Those credentials, and her willingness to
use them, may also relieve Mr. Giuliani of having to wander through the
politically explosive landscape of race relations himself.

Ms. Alter, who is white, lost little time bringing race to the fore. Speaking
after the news conference, she said she perceived Mr. Dinkins as "conflicted, as
an African-American Mayor, about representing the black community." She said she
thought what she called his "indecisiveness" as Mayor in dealing with racial
conflicts had left "a gap for others to come in and wreak havoc."

She cited the Mayor's response to the Crown Heights crisis and to the boycott of
Korean grocery stores as incidents that exposed Mr. Dinkins as either unwilling
or unable to deal forcefully with blacks. "It's a struggle within him," she
said, "to figure out how to act and where to act."

'The Tiles Are Crumbling'

Because of that record, she said, "the gorgeous mosaic that he talked about, the
tiles are now crumbling and he can't put them back together again." Her own
decision to join Mr. Giuliani, she said, was simple. "The philosophy of Rudy
Giuliani is the philosophy of his predecessor, David Dinkins," she said, adding
that she was one of Mr. Dinkins's earliest supporters in his campaign for mayor.
"The problem has been the lack of the ability to implement it. And that's what I
am looking for here."

Mr. Giuliani praised Ms. Alter's ability to "bring people together" and said
that the city's politics were changing. "People want to see something
different," he said. "They don't want to see the same, usual, kind of partisan
politics. The very, very best way to deal with the crises that New York City is
undergoing right now -- social crisis, financial crisis -- New York City needs
to get everybody working together."

That, of course, is just another way of saying, "the multiparty fusion
movement."

Legendary Knight still has the touch;
After 43 years coaching basketball at Alter High School, Joe Petrocelli is
second in Ohio in career wins and as passionate as ever.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 265 words


KETTERING - The Alter High School boys basketball team has lost two games this
season. And both, one could argue, the Knights should have won.

Last Tuesday, Alter lost to Cincinnati Elder in overtime after a questionable
3-point goaltending call against the Knights sent the game into the extra
session. In the season's third game, Alter traveled to Cincinnati Moeller and
shot just one free throw as opposed to 23 for the home team.

"You can't win that game," Alter coach Joe Petrocelli said.

If anyone could, though, it might be Petrocelli. In his 43rd season at Alter, he
has helped his team rebound from a 28-36 record in the past three seasons to a
17-2 mark and the state's No. 2 ranking in Division II heading into its state
tournament debut Monday.

At 69, Petrocelli has heard whispers in the past few seasons that he should step
down as Alter's coach, despite his state second-best 736 career wins (against
254 losses). In response, "Petro" has helped the Knights again become one of the
area's best teams in any division.

"They might say, 'The game has passed him by,' " Petrocelli said. "Well, if it
passes me by, I must catch up with it sometimes."

With a reputation for yelling at referees and intensely caring for his players,
Petrocelli has proved that age doesn't measure success in dealing with teenaged
basketball players at one of the most successful schools in Ohio history.

"I probably wouldn't recognize myself as a young coach," he said. "At that time,
I was nuts all day. Now, I'm just nuts during a game. I've come a long way."

DAYTON - Robert Brown has had a sideline view of two of the area's best high
school football teams.

Both were Thurgood Marshall losses - 42-14 to Alter on Friday night at Welcome
Stadium, and 28-21 to Trotwood-Madison last week, also at Welcome.

So, coach, tell us the difference between those titans.

"Trotwood is a little more athletic," said Brown, Thur-good Marshall's head
coach, stating the obvious. "Doing what they're supposed to do, there's nothing
better than Alter."

The beat goes on for Alter (3-0), but not without some anxious pregame caution.
In their previous two meetings, Thurgood Marshall knocked then-unbeaten Alter
out of the playoff s in 2011 and hung a convincing 34-14 setback on the Knights
last year, Alter's only regular-season defeat.

"It was a little scary," Alter senior quarterback Dusty Hayes said. "We knew we
had to control the chaos and that's what we did. They beat us two years in a row
and that's not really the Alter way."

Hayes made certain the Knights got it right this time. He scored four times, on
runs of 22, 10, 5 and 3 yards. He also whipped a 13-yard scoring pass to Dillon
Daxe.

The new running-clock rule kicked in one minute into the fourth quarter.
Thurgood Marshall (1-2), so impressive in taking Trotwood to the limit last
week, was no match for Alter. .

Thurgood Marshall's ultra-tight, funky double wing-T off ensive formation can be
stuff ed into a phone booth. But this time, Alter had its number.

"This game was an epic win for us," said Alter senior Kraig Howe, a menacing
defensive tackle and three-year starter who is verbally committed to Pitt. "Our
defense, holding them to 14, that doesn't happen often. ... We came out with fi
re in the eyes and fi re in the belly."

There is no chance of Thurgood Marshall landing a playoff KO on Alter this
season. The Cougars are lumped in Division III with Trotwood. Alter is cruising
in D-IV. The last time the Knights played at Welcome, they were eliminated in
the regional fi nal last November by eventual state champ Clinton-Massie.

The Alter/Thurgood Marshall series probably will be shelved for a while as the
Cougars move into the revived Southwest Ohio Public League with Cincinnati teams
next season. Ironically, ease of scheduling was a major factor in its
reformation.

Thurgood Marshall might be hard-pressed to make the playoff s. Unbeaten Winton
Woods, defending D-V state runner-up Columbus Hartley and defending D-III state
champ Akron SVSM all are ahead.

Alter begins Greater Catholic League North Division play against visiting
Fenwick next week .

"It's very satisfying," Alter head coach Ed Domsitz said. "Each week you fi nd
out a little more about your football team. We found out when we're ready to
play, we can do a good job."

Christie sisters follow in their father's footsteps;
Alter standouts play aggressive style, just like former UD captain Dan Christie

BYLINE: POUNDING THE PREP PAVEMENT CHICK LUDWIG

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 532 words


The apples certainly don't fall far from the tree. The Christie sisters - junior
Ashley and sophomore Courtney - play basketball for Alter High School the same
way their father, Dan, played for Oak Harbor High School and the Dayton Flyers.

Scrappy, competitive, aggressive, poised and tough. That was Dan, a 6-foot-1
guard who scored 690 points in 117 career games at UD, where he was team captain
in 1986-87.

That's Ashley and Courtney, too.

Courtney scored 12 points to go with four steals and two assists, while Ashley
had seven points, three assists and two steals in Alter's 53-47 victory over
Chaminade Julienne in the Cage Classic at UD Arena on Saturday night.

"They're smart," coach Chris Hart said. "They're basketball savvy and you can't
teach that."

No-no-no ... yes!

Alter led CJ, 42-38, when Courtney Christie nailed a 3-point shot with 3:42 to
go, giving the Knights a 7-point cushion.

When she launched it, I thought, "No-no-no." When it swished, I thought, "Yes!"

That's not what Hart was thinking.

"That was fine," she said. "It was in the flow of the game."

Christie took the shot with confidence and no hesitation.

"My dad always tells me when I hesitate is when I miss," she said.

Excused absence

The "Top Cat" was away, so the mice got to play.

Carroll girls assistant Stephen Douglas filled in admirably for head coach Rob
Berry by orchestrating the Patriots' 47-32 victory over Fenwick. Carroll's
pressure doomed the Falcons.

Berry was in Princeton, N.J., watching his daughter - Harvard freshman star
Brogan Berry - help the Crimson to an 82-73 victory over the Princeton Tigers at
Jadwin Gym.

Brogan had five points and four assists in 27 minutes as Harvard improved to
10-7 overall and 2-1 in the Ivy League. She nailed 3 of 4 free throws during a
10-second span in the final minute to give the Crimson a 78-73 lead it wouldn't
lose.

Congratulations to ...

* Alter sophomore forward Whitney Dabbelt, who scored 11 points and was
instrumental in holding CJ junior Samarie Walker to two field goals.

* Alter junior guard Michael Adkins, who contributed six crucial points - a
floater in the lane and four free throws - in the Knights' 43-37 win over CJ.
I've watched Adkins play two games and he hasn't missed a shot.

* Carroll freshman point guard Kelley Austria, whose 12 points, four assists and
three steals led the Patriots past Fenwick. The future looks bright with Austria
running the show.

Where are they now?

Amy Tucker, the former Ohio State captain (1981-82) from Springboro High School
who scored 1,629 points in her Buckeyes career and was inducted into the Ohio
State Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, is in her 24th season at Stanford University.
She serves as associate head coach and recruiting coordinator.

Tucker, perhaps the nation's only associate head coach with a fan club, was
instrumental in the recruitment of Beavercreek 6-foot-2 senior center Mikaela

Professor Diane Alters becomes new managing editor of The Colorado Independent

LENGTH: 424  words

DATELINE: Colorado Springs


Colorado college has issued the following news release:

Diane Alters, who has taught classes and workshops here at Colorado College in
journalism, has recently become the new managing editor of the Colorado
Independent, a web-based news website that focuses mainly in policy and
political news.

Alters has embraced her new role. "I'm really excited about this chance to what
I think is a kind of journalism that we need, you know sort of hard hitting,
independent journalism that makes a difference,"she says.

Alters worked at the Boston Globe and the Sacramento Bee before coming to
Colorado College. She has been working at Colorado College for a number of
years, first in Communications, but has been teaching blocks for the past three
or four years, in addition to arranging journalism workshops that have brought
such notable reporters as Dave Phillips and Mark Maremont to CC.

Although Alters is already in her second week as managing editor at the
Independent, she will continue to teach occasional classes here at CC, including
a journalism institute Block A this summer, along with two regular classes and
one half block class next year.

In her new role at the Independent, Alters hopes to push the newspaper towards
what she describes as the, "cutting edge,"of journalism, using many of the same
skills that she has taught journalism students here at CC.

In particular, Alters says she hopes to incorporate some of the, "visuals and
the multimedia stories," that she has taught journalism students here at CC into
her new work at the Independent, along with a greater emphasis on Twitter and
social media.

The prospects of theColoradoIndependentmay appeal and excite Alters, who
describes one of the greatest benefits of her new job as giving her the ability
to "write about news that actually gets people thinking,"but she will miss some
of the teaching she will have to cut back on here at CC. Alters says Colorado
College students are "great--they're really fun to teach."

Under her watch, Alters is already overseeing changes to the Independent,
including starting up a new ad-watch feature to monitor ad spending and ad
buying in upcoming political campaigns.

Alters is embracing the uncertainty that accompanies her new role, acknowledging
that journalism is changing, and that it still may be a tough job market for
journalists. But she says this is part of what makes her new role so exciting,
she's now in the thick of what she says is, "a big experiment"in journalism.

A perfect Knight;
Gillis goes 8 for 8, leads Alter into final with 60-34 victory.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL STATE SEMIFINALS

SECTION: ; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 699 words


Alter's Ty Markoff applies defensive pressure during the Knights' Division II
semifinal victory. Alter will go for a second straight state title when it plays
Ottawa-Glandorf at 2 p.m. Saturday.

COLUMBUS - Olivia Gillis had no idea she was having the game of her career, but
Columbus Eastmoor Academy must have sensed it.

"I didn't really know that until the half," said Gillis, whose 8-for-8 shooting
powered Alter to a 60-34 blowout of East-moor in Thursday's girls Division II
state semifinals at Ohio State University's Schottenstein Center.

"With all that adrenaline and nerves, you just do what you can and prepare
yourself mentally before the game and hope (your shots) go into the hoop."

The payoff is a third straight state championship appearance for Alter (27-2),
which will play Ottawa-Glandorf (26-2) in Saturday's 2 p.m. title game. Glandorf
advanced by defeating five-time state champ Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown 51-40.

The Knights blitzed the Warriors 22-4 in the third quarter to break open a close
game.

Gillis, an emerging 5-foot-10 junior, had 16 points and four rebounds. Another
designated launcher, junior Braxtin Miller, was productive but not quite as
accurate.

Miller scored 19 points going against Eastmoor standout Amani Burke, the sister
of former Michigan star and current Utah Jazz member Trey Burke. Miller had four
3-pointers, nine rebounds and two steals.

"In the first half we came out not as strong as we could have," Miller said. "We
were determined to come out 30 times stronger and put it away in the third
quarter. We all came together as a team and put it together in the third
quarter."

Another Alter junior, Libby Bazelak, had 12 points, 12 rebounds and eight
assists.

That all added up to Alter's most impressive outing in a mounting streak of
high-end performances.

"Our team has improved steadily all year long," Alter co-coach Chris Hart said.
"That's individually and collectively as a team. If we go back and look at our
scrimmage film against Eastmoor and look at where we're at now, we've come
light-years."

Eastmoor (22-5), playing in its third final four but first since 2007, steadily
wilted in the second half. Jala Belcher led the Warriors with 10 points and nine
rebounds.

"We knew we'd have to play our absolute best," coach Charity Martin-Via said. "I
told the girls the longer you play them, the better they get. And sure enough,
that's what we experienced."

Alter went 30-0 last season, beating Toledo Rogers 57-42 in the D-II title game.
In 2014 the Knights were 29-1, losing only to Millers-burg West Holmes 62-45 in
the D-II state title game.

Martin-Via saluted this latest version of the Knights program. "It was an
honor," she said. "I believe we just played the state champion."

Ottawa-Glandorf 51, Hathaway Brown 40:

With its starters playing all but two minutes, Hathaway Brown was worn out by
the fourth quarter and was held scoreless. Glandorf, a Western Buckeye League
member located in Putnam County, scored 14 in the quarter.

Kadie Hempfling had a game-high 20 points and Kylie White 11 for Glandorf, which
lost the D-III state title game last year to Versailles and was bumped up to
D-II following the two-year realignment cycle.

Hathaway Brown (17-11) got 14 points from Jackie Carman and 13 from Dani Lawson.

Hathaway Brown won five consecutive D-II state titles from 2009-13.

Marion Pleasant 50, Gates Mills Gilmour Academy 47: Summer Blevins had a
game-high 18 points and Kamryn Kimmel added 17 in leading the Spartans to a
D-III semifinal win in a matchup of relative final four newcomers. It's the
second final four for Pleasant (27-2) and the first for Gilmour (23-6), which
was led by Naz Hillmon's 16 points and 12 rebounds.

Col. Africentric 63, Ironton 34: Africentric rolled in the second half to easily
win Thursday's D-III opener. Leah Morrow had a game-high 22 points for the
Nubians (23-5). Africentric has won four state titles since 2007.

Alexis Wise led Iron-ton (27-1) with 11 points, and Alexis Barrier added 10
points, 17 rebounds and three steals.

Pleasant will play Africentric in Saturday's D-III title game at 10:45 a.m.

HIGHLIGHT: Hobie Alter is remembered at a Hawaiian tribute on the water off Dana
Point.


Hobie Alter had only one request: He wanted a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out
after he died.

In the blue waters off Dana Point and surrounded by surfboards and sailboats,
Alter's family on April 18 released bowls filled with soil brought from Hawaii,
ocean water and sand from Waikiki beach, and rock salt, which represented the
"purification of one's soul, body and life," said Eric Keawe, a "Kahu," or
Hawaiian priest.

Surfers gathered on boards hooted after a prayer in the form of a Hawaiian song,
splashing water to the sky and holding up paddles with the Hobie insignia. Boats
surrounded the group, while the Orange County Harbor Patrol boat sprayed water,
creating a rainbow in its mist. Flowers floated on the water's surface, and
occasionally, a passing wave lifted surfers.

Hundreds of people paddled out in Alter's honor Friday, paying tribute to a man
who changed the way people use the water for surfing and sailing. He is credited
for transforming the foundation of a surfboard from balsa wood to foam, and then
he went on to revolutionize the sailboat by creating the Hobie Cat, a catamaran
dubbed the "people's boat" because of the ease of use and low cost.

Alter was part of a generation that defined what it meant to be a Southern
California surfer. He died March 29 at his Palm Desert home after a bout with
cancer. He was 80.

Well-known surfer and board shaper Mickey Munoz remembers Alter giving him a job
at his shop in Dana Point, the first of its kind in Southern California. He did
ding repairs on boards for Alter in the '50s.

"I think his legacy is 'Have a Hobie Day.' How better can you say it?" Munoz
said, referring to Alter's longtime slogan.

Surf historians gathered around a booth set up by the Surfing Heritage
Foundation, where the first board ever made by Hobie stood. Foundation founder
Dick Metz knew the original owner in Laguna Beach, who bought it from Hobie for
$40, and asked him to donate it.

Metz was also one of the early employees of Alter, quitting his job as a
bartender to help Alter expand his business. Eventually he helped Alter open 20
stores.

"Hobie didn't like business. He's an inventor, he's a creative guy. He wanted to
be in a workshop all the time," Metz said. "He didn't want to look at a
financial statement. He used to say, 'If it's good for you, it's good for me.' "

CUSTODY ABORT SHOCK Judge OKs 'outrageous' query

BYLINE: BY DAREH GREGORIAN NEW YORK DAILY NEWS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 500 words


A HOLY WAR broke out in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday over a judge's decision
to allow testimony about a woman's abortion to be used against her in an ugly
custody case.

Lisa Mehos' lawyer, Emily Jane Goodman, told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice
Lori Sattler her decision to allow the evidence about her client's procedure -
which happened after her split from banking big John Mehos - was "scandalous and
outrageous."

"This might go over well in Texas or Mississippi, but not here," Goodman said.

The explosive topic was first raised last week by John Mehos' lawyer, Eleanor
Alter, who discovered it after subpoenaing his ex-wife's medical records. She
used it in an apparent attempt to paint Lisa Mehos as a hypocrite for having
asked to have custody of their two young kids over Easter weekend in 2012.

"(At) the time that she told him that he couldn't have the children for Easter
because he was an atheist, she was having an abortion," Alter said, a court
transcript shows.

Alter said she should also be allowed to question Lisa Mehos about the procedure
because "this is a woman who complains that she's under great stress only caused
by Mr. Mehos. I would be the first person to acknowledge that having an
abortion, especially a two- to three-month late abortion, would be stressful."
She said she also wanted to know whether the kids "were exposed to this man, how
it all came about."

"If this man was coming in the house, if she's out of the house to see him, if
it was date rape, that's relevant," Alter said.

Goodman urged the judge not to force her client to testify about the procedure.

"I think the very idea of the potential of using against a woman in a custody
case the fact that she may have had an abortion sets women's rights and the
rights of choice back in a way that I can't imagine this court would want to be
associated," Goodman said.

The judge sided with Alter, noting that Lisa Mehos had previously testified she
had never had any men over to her New York apartment. "I do find it to be
relevant. The children were in her care at the time," Sattler said.

Lisa Mehos, 38, then testified that she became pregnant after a one-time fling
with a longtime friend at his place. She said she had arranged for her mother to
stay with the kids, then ages 2 and 4, while she had the abortion.

She told The News she felt "violated" about having to talk in court about
something that's so personal.

When she returned to testify Tuesday, more than a half-dozen women's rights
activists were in court, some wearing "I had an abortion" T-shirts. Former
Playboy model Bridget Marks, who was involved in a notorious custody case
herself a decade ago, was also there and said what Lisa was going through was
"revolting."

Lisa Mehos wasn't the only one to be embarrassed in court - she testified that
her ex-husband, who heads a bank in Texas, had tearfully confessed to her that
he had cheated on her dozens of times with prostitutes.

The Mehoses were married for six years and divorced in October 2011.

500 evacuees have enrolled in schools here

JEFFERSON CITY - Nearly 500 children displaced from the Gulf Coast region by
Hurricane Katrina have enrolled in public schools across Missouri, Education
Commissioner D. Kent King told the Missouri State Board of Education on
Thursday.

St. Louis Public Schools, the state's largest school district, has reportedly
taken in the most students, King said. District officials did not have an exact
number Thursday. The city district is among 110 statewide that reported
enrolling evacuees.

Medical payment cuts aren't fair, lawyers say

KANSAS CITY - Attorneys for seven disabled Missourians tried Wednesday to
convince a federal judge that Missouri's decision to stop paying for certain
medical equipment is unfair and illegal.

U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple, who last week declined to issue a temporary
restraining order blocking the cuts, said he would review testimony and court
filings and hoped to decide next week whether to issue a preliminary injunction.

The spending cuts do not apply to children or to those who are blind, pregnant
or in nursing homes.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued again Wednesday that the exceptions amount
to illegal discrimination based on diagnosis.

Democrats question Alter's campaign debt

JEFFERSON CITY - The Missouri Democratic Party filed a complaint Thursday with
the state Ethics Commission to question how state Sen. Bill Alter, R-High Ridge,
handled his campaign debt after last spring's special election.

The complaint cites the fact that Alter reported campaign debts totaling
$248,263 on April 17, shortly after his 72-vote victory over Democrat Rick
Johnson. But in the next report, Alter's initial debt figure -- beginning April
18 -- was for $190,403.

The state Democratic Party asks what happened to the rest.

Alter's campaign manager for the contest, Scott Leiendecker, said he was certain
that the problem was a computation error.

Union raises funds for evacuees, laidoff staff

ST. LOUIS - The union that represents St. Louis Public Schools teachers,
secretaries and other school-related staff has joined the effort to raise money
for Hurricane Katrina victims. But those folks may not be the only
beneficiaries.

Money donated specifically to Local 420 of the American Federation of Teachers
will be divided among the local American Red Cross, the union's national
Disaster Relief Fund -- and local union members who recently have been laid off
by the St. Louis school district.

"We're not trying to piggyback off the hurricane," said Local 420 President Mary
Armstrong, "and we want them to think about those who are less fortunate."

Those people, she said, include about 25 employees who got their walking papers
Aug. 22.

St. Louis County

CLAYTON

Property tax rate drop is expected Tuesday

ST. LOUIS COUNTY - The County Council is expected on Tuesday to reduce its
property tax rate by 2.25 cents for each $100 of assessed value. The saving for
owners of houses worth $136,000 -- the approximate median value of single-family
houses in the county -- would be $5.81.

The council members met Thursday to conduct a public hearing on the measure. At
the end of the session, the members of the Republican-controlled council voted
4-2 along party lines to recommend the rate cut.

The reduction would occur in the rate for retiring bonds. Councilman Kurt
Odenwald, R-Shrewsbury, said the county should not take more money than needed.
"We should give it back to taxpayers," he said.

James Baker, the director of administration, said the county should keep the old
rate to be prudent and maintain a reserve equal to one year of bond payments,
which total about $14 million.

MSD will begin sewer construction in 3 places

ST. LOUIS AREA - The Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District soon will begin
large-scale sewer construction projects in Chesterfield, Olivette and St. Louis.

Contracts awarded by the district will cover work in the area of Schoettler and
Clayton roads in Chesterfield, in the area of Dielman and Old Bonhomme roads in
Olivette and south of Eichelberger Street and west of Childress Avenue in St.
Louis.

St. Charles County

Mayor, others will take donations to Louisanna

ST. PETERS - Mayor Shawn Brown is among officials in St. Charles County who plan
to travel to Baton Rouge, La., to deliver donated supplies for Hurricane Katrina
victims.

Volunteers plan to have a collection drive from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at
the Dove House at Ellington Place. Donations of canned goods and other
nonperishable food items, bottled water, disposable baby diapers and toiletries
such as deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap, laundry detergent and
household cleaning items are needed.

Golf tournament will honor late teacher

LAKE SAINT LOUIS - This year's Lake Saint Louis Memorial Golf Classic will honor
the memory of the late Kathy McLaren, a teacher at Green Tree Elementary School,
who died after a three-year battle with breast cancer on Dec. 15, 2004.

The golf tournament, sponsored by the Lake Saint Louis Chamber of Commerce and
Ambassadors of Lake Saint Louis, will be Sept. 19 at Lake Forest Golf & Country
Club. Registration will begin at 11 a.m. with tee time at 12:15 p.m.

ILLINOIS

Schools have enrolled up to 300 evacuees

SPRINGFIELD - Up to 300 children from the Gulf Coast region displaced by
Hurricane Katrina have enrolled in public schools across Illinois, a spokeswoman
from the State Board of Education said Thursday.

Spokeswoman Becky Watts called the estimate of 250 to 300 new students "very
preliminary, very rough."

"The numbers change hourly," she said.

Madison County

Teachers vote to strike over raises on Sept. 19

COLLINSVILLE - Collinsville teachers voted Wednesday to strike on Sept. 19. The
Collinsville District School Board and teachers' union can't agree on how much
of a raise the district can afford. Board President Jim Achenbach is frustrated
that Illinois law, unlike Missouri's, allows teachers to strike.

Stacey Soehlke, spokeswoman for the Collinsville union, said district teachers
tried to negotiate a raise they felt was fair. "This (strike) is the last thing
we want to do," she said Thursday.

Widow names Marion hospital and doctor in suit

EDWARDSVILLE - The widow of a Carterville, Ill., man who died last year after a
motorcycle accident filed a wrongful-death suit Thursday in Madison County
Circuit Court against a hospital and doctor in Marion, Ill.

According to the suit, Joe Ansinelli was transported to Heartland Regional
Medical Center in Marion after he was injured in the accident on June 14, 2004.
Ansinelli was later transferred by helicopter to St. Louis University Medical
Center, where he died that day.

The suit contends that a physician at Heartland Regional, Dr. Daniel Bercu,
improperly treated Ansinelli and failed to transfer the injured man in a timely
manner.

Subdivision plans stall after rezoning rejection

EDWARDSVILLE

A developer's proposal to build a 208-home subdivision on St. Catherine's
Village Golf Club north of the city stalled Wednesday when the Madison County
Zoning Board rejected the builder's request to rezone the property from
agricultural to residential.

After stiff opposition from neighbors to the proposed subdivision and the rural
water district that would supply the site, Kevin Huelsmann, of TAK Properties,
said he and investment partner Ted Gianaris were considering their options but
have no new timeline for construction.

St. ClairCounty

Residents cheer store's decision to stay open

EAST ST. LOUIS - The announcement that East St. Louis' only full-service grocery
will remain open drew support from city leaders and residents at a press
conference Thursday.

Jim Koman, president of Koman Properties, confirmed to the group that the
Schnucks at 2511 State Street will remain open and that additional stores will
be built. Koman bought the Schnucks property from a land trust and will lease it
to Schnucks for $1 a year. Schnucks has committed to operate the store for at
least five years.

This year's art festival has been canceled

O'FALLON - The third annual Art in the Park Interactive Festival scheduled for
Oct. 1 at O'Fallon Community Park has been canceled, city officials said.

The festival organizers did not receive enough applications from professional
artists or interest from enough volunteers to make the event possible. The
festival was to have included performances by music and theatrical groups as
well as paintings, pottery, sculpture and other works by professional artists.

Alter girls soccer coach poised to carry on tradition

BYLINE: DAVE LAMB HERE AND THERE

SECTION: BEAVERCREEK FAIRBORN AND XENIA; Pg. RF-11

LENGTH: 485 words


If Corrie Weckesser wasn't already familiar with the Alter High School girls
soccer program, this is how athletic director Chris Hart could have approached
her before and after offering her the head coaching job.

Before: "You will take over a tradition-rich program that reached the regional
final last year with a 16-3-1 record."

After: "Oh, by the way, you graduated all 11 starters.

Either way, Weckesser is poised for the challenge to succeed Jason Balogh, who
stepped down after nine successful seasons.

"I've wanted to be the head of a program," she said. "Once I got involved with
the Alter program, I respected the values and morals and the outstanding
tradition of Alter."

The former Beavercreek High School standout - then as Corrie Vuckovich - started
her coaching career with the freshmen team at Mesa High School in Arizona in
2000. After returning to the Dayton area, she spent three years with the Carroll
program and the past two seasons at Alter.

Weckesser, who spent last season as a varsity assistant, is unfazed by losing so
much experience from the team.

"We have eight players returning, a strong JV team and I heard we have an
outstanding incoming freshmen class," she said.

Weckesser, who teaches third grade at Incarnation School in Centerville, knows
she wants to instruct her players on more than returning to the state
tournament.

"I'm coaching the whole person," she said. "I want to teach responsibility on
and off the field, dedication to academics, soccer and family."

She'll keep family in mind when planning her practice schedule. Her husband,
Jim, a former outstanding runner at Centerville High School and Bowling Green,
coaches the Elk cross country team.

"We'll try to schedule practices at the same time so we can actually have dinner
together," said Corrie, who was married last June.

Balogh gives endorsement

Balogh brought Weckesser into the Alter program two years and knew she was ready
for the top job.

"Corrie is an excellent hire for the girls program at Alter," Balogh said. "Last
year, I brought her up to the varsity staff with my intentions being to get her
prepared to possibly take over the program when I stepped down."

Successful nine-year run ends

With his second child born in January, Balogh decided it was time to spend more
time with family.

"Leaving Alter was a very difficult decision for me, because it was such a huge
part of my life the past nine years," he said.

Balogh posted a record of 80-45-17, highlighted by an appearance in the state
championship game in 2001.

In addition to that banner season, the Knights won district titles in 2003, '04
and last season. They reached the regional finals two of those seasons.

Balogh will remain involved in soccer, but closer to home. He will serve as a
varsity assistant for Eric Detmer at Springboro High School, which is located
about five minutes from his home.

Alter squeaks by Fairmont;
Firebirds' ground game stifled in 10-7 Knights win

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi mgokavi@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 419 words


KETTERING - Fairmont's Cameron Campeau and Alter's Matt Krystofic presented a
game ball Friday night to the namesake of Chester A. Roush Stadium.

The Knights made sure that was Campeau's longest carry of the night.

Alter held Fairmont's big running back to an unofficial 32 yards on 15 attempts.
That, plus ball control, field position and Nick Glavin's 32-yard field goal
gave the Knights a 10-7 victory.

"Every play, we knew where (Campeau) was lined up no matter what," said
Krystofic, Alter's All-Ohio linebacker. "If we stopped him, they were going to
have to do something special to beat us."

Each team gave the 8,000 fans some special moments in the battle of Kettering.
Alter led 7-0 when Chris Roark scored on a 9-yard counter in the first quarter.

Fairmont came back with an 82-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Doughman to Richard
Barr. Other than that, the Firebirds struggled to move the ball. They were done
in by two interceptions, a fumble, dropped passes and Alter's tackling.

"We had every scenario down," Krystofic said. "We were in the right place at the
right time except for that one we had a mental mistake."

Roark rushed for 71 yards while Alter QB Steve O'Donnell completed two passes
for 62 yards. The totals aren't massive, but Alter coach Ed Domsitz will take
the result.

"We didn't put it in the end zone as much as we wanted," Domsitz said. "We sure
were able to eat up the clock and we did move the ball."

Fairmont's best drive came in the third quarter. After converting 4th-and-1 and
3rdand-12 plays, Doughman was stripped of the ball and Alter's Andy Niekamp
recovered.

The Knights then drove 42 yards, capped off by Glavin's field goal.

"Nick Glavin has waited for a while for that," Domsitz said. "Nick's capable.
He's been kicking since his sophomore year."

After that kick, Fairmont (0-1) ran 19 plays for just 43 yards and two first
downs. Campeau had just 17 yards on four carries after halftime. One drive ended
when Alter's Joe Braner intercepted a tipped pass.

"We were hoping to get Campeau going but they wanted all out to stop him,"
Fairmont coach Brian Blevins said. "We had to throw the ball and, doggone it, we
have to catch it."

Alter (1-0) avenged last season's 21-16 loss. Though the Knights also will call
"The Chet" home next season, they spoiled the revamped Firebirds' stadium
opening.

"Any time you beat Fairmont - if we were in a parking lot playing Fairmont - it
would feel great beating them," Domsitz said. "It's just that kind of a
rivalry."

Alter principal retiring

KETTERING - Sister Katie Hoelscher will be retiring from Alter High School on
June 30, after more than 30 years of high school teaching and administrative
work in the Dayton area.

"I never planned to be an administrator," said Hoelscher, 68, the school's
principal. "There's a special thing about teaching. I loved the interaction with
the kids. As a principal, you have a completely different relationship with the
kids. As an administrator, you affect more people in a different way."

She came to Alter High School in 1972. After teaching at Alter for one year, she
was asked to be principal at St. Joseph's Commercial High School for girls in
Dayton.

Hoelscher returned to Alter in 1974. She taught math and was principal from 1981
to '86. In 2000, she returned, to Alter's alumni office. In 2005, she became
interim principal.

"I will miss the kids and the relationships with faculty and parents," Hoelscher
said. "One of the greatest blessings has been teaching the kids of the parents I
taught."

Alter's Courtney wins national title;
Two-sport athlete drawing interest from Big 10, SEC schools.

BYLINE: By Kamari Stevens Staff Writer

SECTION: CENTERVILLE & WASHINGTON TWP.; Pg. RH6

LENGTH: 483 words


For Megan Courtney, being a part of a state or national championship team was
one of her biggest goals. She narrowly missed that goal with Alter High School's
girls volleyball team last season, finishing second in the state. Her Dayton
Lady HoopStars 13U team finished third in the nation.

"I'd gotten so close to a national championship," Courtney, 15, said.

They say the third time's a charm.

Courtney won a Junior Volleyball Director Association national championship in
Louisville, Ky., June 26-30, with Cincinnati-based Team Z 16s Orange. The
tournament featured 500 teams that ranged from ages 12-18. Courtney's team
competed in the 16s Open division.

Courtney, a Washington Township resident, said she was recruited by one of the
team's players. Her new teammates told her that Team Z was drama-free and they
would accept her.

"From the start I knew I could be myself on this team," Courtney said. "It
really played a role in how I played because I knew that no matter what happened
on the court ... off the court we were always going to be sisters."

Courtney usually plays setter - the quarterback on the floor - for Alter. With
Team Z, she couldn't play the position because she would only be able to play
parttime at the beginning of the season since it coincided with basketball.
Since Courtney was a very capable hitter, she was able to position herself as
the outside hitter.

Courtney, who is 6-foot-1, was named to the all-tournament team at nationals.

"Everyone was really emotional," Courtney said about winning the championship.
"It was the greatest feeling in the world."

Courtney has played volleyball since she was a second-grader. She said that
watching her mother and father play recreational volleyball is what got her
interested in the sport. Courtney's older brother Robbie, an Alter graduate,
plays volleyball for Quincy College.

The support seems to be working. With the exposure she has received from playing
with Alter and Team Z, Courtney has received letters from Penn State, Kentucky,
Purdue and Illinois.

Alter's girls volleyball team will be losing five seniors from last season's
state runner-up squad, according to Courtney. She hopes to transfer what she has
gained from playing with Team Z to her high school team.

"I know what it feels like to win and how far you have to go to get there,"
Courtney said. "The work ethic you have to (have), the focus, the concentration,
the time management. It's really hard, but you gotta work at it, if you want to
(win)."

Courtney plays volleyball yearround and doesn't worry about getting burned out.

"I've thought about it," she said. "(But) when I don't play volleyball, I'm mad.
It's hard for me to sit and watch a volleyball game because I'm so intense about
it ... I want to be in there playing, not sitting on the sidelines.

"My love for volleyball is unlimited."

Alter looks to finish;
Veteran Knights a favorite to win elusive Division II state title.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL SEASON PREVIEW

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 613 words


The Knights console each other after being defeated by Millersburg West Holmes
62-45 in the Division II state championship last season. It was the only game
Alter (29-1) lost.

The Alter girls high school basketball team suffered the cruelest fate in last
season's state championships. Alter fell to top-ranked Millersburg West Holmes
62-45 in a Division II state final showdown of unbeaten state powers.

That was the only loss for Alter (29-1).

"We felt like we fell one game short, that's for sure," reflects Knights coach
Chris Hart. "I'm not sure that we say that a whole lot, but it's right there."

Of course it is, especially since a robust 10 letter winners return from that
team. That's why Alter will be a favorite to return to Columbus and contend for
an elusive state title.

The Knights and most other area teams begin that quest this weekend with
season-opening games. Alter opens against Oak Hills at Cincinnati Ursuline at
noon Saturday.

Centerville (D-I), Kenton Ridge (D-II), Tippecanoe (D-II), Versailles (D-III)
and Fort Loramie (D-IV) all should have strong seasons and make deep postseason
runs. Versailles fell 49-37 to Columbus Africentric in last season's D-III state
final. Loramie was ousted by Reeds-ville Eastern 68-59 in a D-IV state
semifinal.

Alter's deep and experience lineup includes former Greater Catholic League
player of the year Maddie Bazelak, a 6-foot senior, reigning GCL player of the
year Emma Bockrath, a 5-9 senior, and Braxtin Miller, a 5-10 sophomore.

Ironically, both Miller (broken ankle) and Bockrath (torn ACL) suffered serious
injuries while playing against each other in an AAU game last summer. Both have
fully recovered.

"Our kids are a year older, obviously," Hart said. "We're playing at a higher
level this year already. We also have a huge target on our backs and we all
realize that."

? Centerville, led by 6-foot-5 senior Shannon Coffee, was 23-4 last season and
tied Fairmont (23-3) for the Greater Western Ohio Conference Central Division
title. But neither could get out of the regional, which snapped a streak of four
straight final fours for Fairmont.

Coffee has signed with Stanford. Fairmont will not have graduates Kathryn
Westbeld (Notre Dame) or Makayla Waterman (Ohio State) in the lineup for the
first time in four seasons.

? Other area players to have already signed are Fairmont's Shea Morgan (North
Carolina High Point), Springboro's Rachel Price (Tiffin), Tippecanoe's Halee
Printz (Toledo), Bellbrook's Lexi Seger (Findlay) and Sophie Sonneman of
Greeneview (Lake Erie).

Also, Tipp junior Carly Clodfelter has verbally committed to Wright State.

? Bellbrook (20-5) won at least 20 games for the fourth straight season. Head
coach Jason Tincher is 189-59 in 10 seasons and has enough veterans and
promising new players to do that again.

? Kenton Ridge coach Ed Foulk is in his 30th season with the Cougars and had his
team (26-2) last season. Starters Sidney Bates, Baylee Bennett and Jamari
McDavid all return. Ridge lost to Alter in the D-II regional final.

Foulk owns a career record of 562-155.

? The dean of area girls coaches, Beaver-creek's Ed Zink, is back in his 40th
season with the Beavers. With four returning starters, the Beavers (16-9) should
contend with Centerville and Fairmont for GWOC Central honors.

Zink and Dave Butcher of Pickerington North have traded spots as the state's
all-time winningest girls hoop coach the past several seasons.

Butcher enters the season with a 700-99 career record in 31 seasons and Zink is
at 698-214.

First-time helmer perfectly suited to stir up 'Sleep' with the best of L.A.

LENGTH: 614  words


There are many paths to becoming a director or producer, but few have meandered
like Jeremy Alter's on the way to his helming debut, "The Perfect Sleep."

Alter is best known for his award-winning work as a locations manager, with
credits that range from "Liar Liar" and David Lynch's "Lost Highway" to
"Anchorman" and Sacha Baron Cohen's upcoming "Bruno." He won a California On
Location Award for his work on Alexander Payne's "Sideways."

But what he always wanted to do was direct. And produce.

"I kept working in locations but always had a eye on directing and producing,"
Alter says.

At long last, his first directing job is a film noir with a pinch of Dostoevsky,
a movie that features, unsurprisingly, some of the best locations in Los
Angeles, including those that an indie of its size has no business procuring.

Among the highlights is the Bradbury Building, a landmark edifice featured in
such classics as 1950's "D.O.A." and "Blade Runner."

Alter hadn't shot there as a location manager, but for his directorial debut he
used all of his connections and shot for the moon. That led to the locations
influencing the script.

"The script didn't call for the Bradbury, but once I convinced the people to let
us shoot there, then we sort of changed the script to work with the building,"
he says. "(Locations) worked hand in hand with the development of the story."

The building became the home of the protagonist, a tormented assassin, and its
true-life, infamous history became integrated into the backstory.

Among other locations, Alter and production designer Clayton Hartley snagged the
now-demolished, cavernous pressroom of downtown's Herald Examiner; Pasadena's
former Moorish Colonial- and Spanish-style hotel Castle Green; the Park Plaza
Hotel in Mid-Wilshire; the wind generators near Palm Springs; the former home of
Camarillo State Mental Hospital, now California State University, Channel
Islands; the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart convent in Los Feliz; and Fort
MacArthur in San Pedro.

"My goal was to take locations that people may recognize and feature them in a
way they haven't been," Alter says.

Part of that philosophy extended to the way the movie was filmed: wide shots
that give audiences a good look at the surroundings while allowing pools of
light to gather. It is something Alter says was inspired by a Japanese noir
film, 1967's "Branded to Kill."

Alter, who interned at New Line during the early 1990s and worked PA jobs before
becoming a locations manager, believes locations work -- a job underappreciated
and misunderstood by many -- prepared him for his current roles.

Scouting requires director-like skills because it asks one to think about how a
locale will look on film, how practical it is and how the crew and cameras will
shoot and light.

Locations managing, in Alter's eyes, is micro-producing: on a set, negotiating
deals with the home owner, securing permits, hiring police and security and
making sure the production gets what it wants -- all in the most cost-effective
manner possible.

"The two facets, the managing and scouting, complement producing and directing,"
he says.

"Sleep" opened last week in Los Angeles and unspools Friday in New York before a
slow, multicity rollout next month. In the meantime, Alter is keeping his focus
on directing, recently helming videos for Chris Cornell and New Found Glory as
well as a stylized interview with U2. (He also was a co-producer on Lynch's
"Inland Empire.")

"Locations work does come my way, and I do have to think of the wife and three
kids," he says. "But hopefully I will be producing and directing -- and I will
always be nice to my locations manager."

Elena and Manuel Mendoza operate a popular alterations business in San Jose's
Almaden Valley

BYLINE: By Carol Rosen, Correspondent

SECTION: COMMUNITIES; San Jose - Valley; News

LENGTH: 580 words


Elena and Manuel Mendoza have worked with clothing all of their adult lives, the
past 18 years at Almaden Oaks Plaza.

The couple, who own Almaden Alterations, have customers coming to them from as
far away as Maryland, Washington, D.C., Utah, Nevada and in California from
Salinas to Sacramento and from Fresno to San Francisco including Los Altos and,
of course, Almaden.

Both came in 1970 from Mexico for a summer vacation to Los Angeles. Both stayed,
meeting and marrying a year later, becoming citizens and raising their daughter
Elma. Manuel had trained as a tailor following in his father and uncle's
footsteps. He went to work for Jack the Tailor in Beverly Hills making clothes
for many male movie stars.

Like most girls in Mexico, Elena learned to sew around the age of 12. She was
designing and making clothes after that. Although she'd decided to pursue her
education, she says, "I came to the States and never went back, because I met
the love of my life."

After 10 years in Los Angeles and some time in Chicago, the two opened Manuel
and Elena Tailoring in Los Altos and worked there for 10 years. Around 1991 the
couple decided to go back to Mexico to be close to their families. After four
years they returned to Northern California and opened their current business.

Early on at the Almaden location, the two would make custom clothing and alter
everything from wedding gowns to furs and leather to fancy sequined dresses.
About eight years ago, they decided to do alterations only, and while they still
work with leather, they no longer make clothes or alter wedding gowns. However,
they will alter most anything else, although there's not too much call for furs
anymore, says Elena.

They do all the work themselves. "We do quality alterations. A few years ago,
one of our customers brought in a copy of Consumer Reports that gave our
business a quality check. We don't have employees because we can't always
guarantee their work."

One of their current customers first came into the store with one garment. Once
Elena pinned the garment, the client went out to her car and brought in two
additional bags of clothes that needed altering. "She said she liked the looks
of our shop and was happy with the way I worked with her to alter the first
garment."

Another customer moved to Florida more than 10 years ago but comes back
periodically with lots of clothing. Elena questioned her about the expense and
the travel, but the customer said alterations people in Florida ruined her
clothes.

If Elena doesn't like the way clothing looks or fits, she will say so,
encouraging customers to exchange the clothes for something that looks better
and refusing to fix them. So customers trust her work.

"We have the best clientele--wonderful people, trusting--and we are very blessed
with our customers," Elena says. "We don't advertise because we want to keep our
shop exclusive. If customers like our work they spread the word; if they don't
they will spread the word just as quickly."

The couple have been married for 39 years this month, and still manage to work
together five days a week and play together on their days off. "We're together
24 hours a day, seven days a week and we still get along. I think it's because
we have really big, really sharp scissors," she says laughingly. "He's good and
I'm great!"

Almaden Alterations, 6055 Meridian Ave. in the Almaden Oaks Center, is open
Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday.

Carroll's Cogan: 'Great things are happening';
HIGH SCHOOLS BOYS BASKETBALL

SECTION: ; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 556 words


Tim Cogan experienced up close and personal the mental edge Alter had on
Carroll. Alter had long ago established itself as the go-to grooming grounds for
the sons of many former University of Dayton men's basketball standouts who
chose to anchor here.

And for Carroll? The football program was outstanding.

"I know going to Carroll in the past, different things people fear in Alter,"
reflected Cogan, a Carroll grad who left an unprecedented and state-title run
with the Fairmont girls high school basketball program to return to the Linden
Avenue landmark as the Patriots boys coach. "We do not fear Alter."

Carroll doesn't have championship banners this season, but the Patriots have the
next best thing: a stunning 53-42 defeat of Alter. The unlikely Division II
season-defining win played out at Fairmont's Trent Arena on Wednesday night
before an enthusiastic Patriots following. Carroll (11-12) will play Ponitz
(16-7) in one of three D-II sectional finals at UD Arena on Saturday.

In the regular season, Carroll (3-7) was buried in last place in the Greater
Catholic League Co-Ed North Division but had proved to be a tough out, losing
five games by a combined nine points, including a 1-pointer to Alter.

ButCarrollplayedatachampionship level against Alter (19-4), which had swept the
divisional series and won its second straight North title. That earned Alter a
No. 3 seed behindTrotwood-Madisonand Dunbar, traditionally three of the area's
best D-II boys programs.

ThePatriotswantedanother shot at the Knights, a testament to Cogan's turnabout
influence.

"We've been through some adversity, losing some games by one or two points," he
said. "Our goal as far as a winning season was winning about life. We had to
teach these kids we had to play together and deal with adversity. ... Great
things are happening."

Ponitz advanced by shading GCL North rep Fenwick, also on Wednesday, 47-46.

? Springboro girls coach Tom Benjamin has had four consecutive seasons of
20-plus wins, which puts the Panthers atop the area D-I's best along with Wayne.
Benjamin took his team to task following a 54-31 rout of rival Lebanon in a
sectional final at Troy.

"I nitpick," he admitted. "A great man once told me you're only as good as the
weakest segment of your game allows you to be. I know our players are thinking,
jeez, another week with Benj."

Greater Western Ohio ConferencerepsSpringboro(20-5), Wayne (20-4) and
Beavercreek (17-8) will be hard-pressed to make it out of Saturday's D-I
district finals at Princeton. The GWOC has been overtaken by the Greater Miami
Conference since Cogan guided Fairmont to successive state final fours from
2010-13.

The girls D-II district finals are today at Mason. The other girls district
finals are Saturday at Springfield (D-III) and Troy (D-IV).

?Versailles (D-III) has taken its boys game to the next level. Fueled by junior
and Ohio State commit Justin Ahrens, the Midwest Athletic Conference champs
(23-1) are in a loaded Southwest District. Other top contenders are Cincinnati
Summit Country Day (23-0) and Cincinnati Roger Bacon (20-4) of the GCL Co-Ed
Central. Bacon has been in the state final four twice in the last three seasons.

All three programs should collide in the regional along with a Columbus rep.

Alter girls win elusive state title;
Knights end run of second-place finishes; Versailles D-III champ.

BYLINE: Ryan Hehr Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 395 words


COLUMBUS - Instead of the third time being a charm, the fourth time did it for
Alter's girls cross country team.

After placing second the last three years, the Knights finally captured a state
title at Scioto Downs, the first in the program's history. Alter beat runner-up
Cuyahoga Valley Christian 94-111.

"Everywhere we went, people were asking us if this was going to be our year,"
said head coach Matt Sableski. "To be so close three straight years and finally
put it together and finally get the prize, it's just great."

Leading the way for Alter was senior Hilary Esselstein, who finished third
overall in 18 minutes, 22 seconds.

"It feels great having everyone come up to congratulate us," said Esselstein.
"It hasn't even sunk in yet, but I'm still excited."

The pressure was on Esselstein's younger sister Rebecca. After dropping out of
last week's regional, she needed to finish well for the Knights to win. She did,
running fifth for the team and 47th overall (19:54). Had she dropped out, there
would have been a 30-point swing back to Alter's sixth runner.

Also scoring for Alter were Mary Untener (35th, 19:37), Catherine Crisler (40th,
19: 49), and Ally Stober (43rd, 19:51). Seniors Brianna Liberio and Emily
Zimmerman rounded out Alter's top 7.

Milton-Union placed fifth behind sisters Angela (14th) and Nicole Klimkowski
(21st). Oakwood's Julia Sizek (23rd) also earned All-Ohio honors.

Division III

When Versailles head coach Mark Pleiman heard his girls had won the team title,
his emotions got the best of him. He dropped to his knees and shed tears in the
infield.

"I didn't think we'd be anywhere near that," Pleiman said. "After finishing
fourth at regionals, we were happy just to be here."

Versailles edged defending state champion Gilmour Academy, 119-120.

When Fort Loramie freshman Janel Olberding crossed the line in second (18:28),
her eyes were also moist.

"These are tears of joy," Olberding said between sniffles. "I just wanted to
come here and do my best, and I did just that."

Minster's team was third and Fort Loramie fifth.

Division I

Carly Hamilton ran an 18:12 and placed third to lead Springboro to sixth as a
team.

Vandalia Butler's Hannah Charbel was seventh (18:27) and Megan Wright of
Miamisburg ninth (18:30). Northmont's Hannah Turlington was 16th (18:34).
Centerville was eighth as a team (196).

Alter students participate in march in D.C.

Seventeen Alter High School students traveled to Washington D.C. with teacher
Michelle Popp on Jan. 24 to participate in the annual "March for Life" marking
the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision to legalize
abortion.

The march in opposition to abortion began with a rally on the mall in
Washington, moved up Constitution Boulevard, and culminated with a final rally
at the steps of the Supreme Court building, with crowd estimates ranging from
100,000 to 400,000, including 52 U.S. representatives and one senator.

Alter students making the trip were Julianne Butler, Emily Reeve, Ashleigh
Stewart, Sarah Stier, Jacob Wright, Anna Daley, Allie Smith, Melissa Bellamy,

Newsweek editor gives inside view;
Journalist says election signals unstable political times

BYLINE: By ADAM JACKSON; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 634 words


BERRIEN SPRINGS -- Political journalist Jonathan Alter spoke for an hour at
Andrews University on Thursday without once using the phrase "pregnant chad."

No mean feat, considering the purpose of the lecture was to give the school's
students and faculty an insider's view of the chaos surrounding the recent
presidential election.

Still, Alter, who is a senior editor at Newsweek magazine and a noted political
analyst, regaled the audience of more than 300 students and faculty with his
take on the strange circumstances that led to the Florida ballot follies,
Supreme Court sessions, and hand vote counts that led to George W. Bush's
presidency.

Millie Das is the coordinator for Campus Ministries, the organization that
invited Alter to speak at the school. She said the hope was that the
journalist's lecture could serve to further political discussion among the
student body.

"We have students at Andrews from all over the world, and because of that, the
political process is a subject of much interest," she said. "We had actually
scheduled (Alter) to come speak in December, but the situation in Florida made
that impossible for him."

For most of the students and faculty in attendance, the lecture seemed to be
worth the wait. There were more than a few chuckles from the crowd as Alter
delivered a monologue liberally sprinkled with anecdotes and off-the-wall
comparisons.

Like his reflection on seeing President Clinton at the Democratic National
Convention, while the Broadway cast of "The Music Man" performed a number from
the classic musical.

"That's when it hit me: Clinton is sort of like our own Professor Harold Hill
from that production," Alter said. "He's a con man, but we all kind of like him
a little bit, anyway."

Another notable analogy came when the topic switched to the Florida Supreme
Court's role in the election. As part of his election coverage, Alter had a
front-row seat on the steps of the courthouse in Tallahassee when the court's
spokesman stepped out to tell the throng of journalists of the ruling approving
the recount.

"In 1975, I managed, as a college freshman, to get a standing room only ticket
to Game Six of the World Series," he said. "That was the game when Carlton Fisk
hit a home run that kept the Red Sox in the World Series.

"And that was the feeling when we heard of the ruling in favor of the recount.
No one knew if Gore would win, but we knew he was still in the game."

What no one knows, Alter said, is what lies ahead. While the changing of the
presidency is always a time of uncertainty, he said the confusion surrounding
the election seemed to be only the beginning of a particularly unstable time in
American politics.

As a political journalist, he didn't mind.

"We are all asking: What are those forces beneath the surface, and how will they
erupt over the next four years?" Alter said. "It is like we've stepped on a land
mine and heard the click, but it hasn't gone off yet.

"It makes political reporting interesting and compelling."

Interesting and compelling might have been a fitting description of the lecture
by some of the attendees on hand. Kelly Case, an 18-year-old first-year student,
said she appreciated the event for the candid look into the political scene.

"(Alter) gave some behind-the-scenes information we usually can't see," she
said. "I think it's interesting to take a look at politics from a journalist's
point of view."

Betsy Lindquist, 19, said the lecture filled in where classroom discussion on
the political process surrounding the election left off.

"We didn't discuss this much in class, and I was kind of interested in hearing
more about it," she said. "I followed the election, so I was looking forward to
this."

Legendary vocalist Cindy Alter returns with a lot of Clout

BYLINE:  Arts Writer

SECTION: TONIGHT BROADSHEET; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 601 words


FOR four years they reigned supreme - South Africa's leading international pop
band Clout. At the helm, the formidable voice of Cindy Alter, selling over 12
million albums and charting at Number 1 around the world, including a No. 2 the
UK.

Clout once shared stages in Europe with The Police, Debbie Harry, Supertramp,
Dire Straights, The Village People, Boney M, Gloria Gaynor, Kiss, Dire Straits,
Thin Lizzy, Van Halen, Kiss, and all the top bands of the late 70's and 80's.

They earned five SARIE (SAMA) awards, and numerous platinum and gold records,
the biggest achievement to date for a band from South Africa. When Clout
disbanded, Alter formed The Cindy Alter Band, which eventually became Zia, one
of the first multi-racial bands in the country.

They released five albums, touring Africa and France, opening for The Bee Gees,
Mahlathini and The Mahotela Queens, and gigged with Chico, Lucky Dube, Stimela,
Sipho Hotstix Mabuse, Brenda Fassie, Mango Groove, and Hotline.

Alter was the prime songwriter for Zia, penning hits such as Nobody Loves You
Like I Do, Wake Up, Are the Children Coming Home and Trust in Me.

In 1990 Alter moved to Los Angeles to pursue her song writing journey. She
recorded two solo self-penned CD's, and shared stages with Kenny Loggins, Sophie
B. Hawkins, Clint Black, Olivia Newton-John, Glen Phillips and Jim Messina.

Cindy also hosted numerous song writing showcases, workshops and was a guest on
panels at various events across Los Angeles

In 2002 she toured Nashville, playing venues like the Bluebird CafÃ© and Exit
In, and met industry big-wigs who were interested in her songs. Just as she was
about to move there, she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, and all
her plans were put on hold, as she underwent almost a year of treatments,
chemotherapy, radiation and finally, a stem-cell bone marrow transplant in 2003.

When all was done the singer decided she needed to go back home, to Africa, to
heal, and in 2005 she returned to her birthplace, putting Clout back together
for a reunion tour, releasing a new CD, four of the songs written by her. And
after almost 30 years of being apart, Clout was nominated for a SAMA award.

Making the decision to stay in South Africa and moving onto new things, Cindy
teamed up with Stewart Irving, creating the duo, Alter Irving, touring locally,
opening for Air Supply. After putting a band together, they released a CD titled
Chained to the Wind. Alter wrote six of the tracks on the album.

After penning a range of works last year Alter and producer Denholm Harding
recorded Faith and Fire, her first solo album recorded here, which some fans
view as her best work to date. She also went on to publish her autobiography, No

NOW HEAR THIS

Beavercreek girls hoop coach Ed Zink wasn't wired to a microphone, but that was
the effect at Alter's tiny gym last Saturday. After watching his mostly
sophomore lineup struggle against Alter's defensive pressure, Zink unloaded,
often to the amusement of a large crowd. Among his high-decible commands were:
"Somebody's got to move!" and "Go screen somebody!" and "Don't go to the
corner!" "Alter's a lot like us," said Zink following a 43-27 victory. "Defense
is our forte and offensively, we both struggle a little bit. We'd keep our head
down and dribble right to the trap on the corner, which is what we try to do on
our trap. We go against that just about every night in practice. You'd think
when you get in a game

" . . .

SENIOR SERVICE

Beavercreek girls hoop senior center Andi Kuhlman on four sophomore starting
teammates: "It's interesting. You never know what's going to happen sometimes,
but they really handle themselves good. . . . Sometimes we have to settle them
down, some. They can get a little antsy and run and gun. We usually settle down
in the second half and pick it up a little bit better." Joining Kuhlman as
starters are sophomores Amy Green, Brittany Tonne, Kelsie Cooley and Kuhlman's
sister, Niki Kuhlman.

TOUGH ENOUGH

Alter girls hoop coach Chris Hart has loaded up the D-II Knights with plenty of
bigtime opponents. A series with Beavercreek was resumed last season. Besides
the GGCL schedule, Alter also plays Fairmont, Centerville, Carroll and
independent rival Chaminade-Julienne. That's the kind of lineup that Hart
envisions will best prepare Alter for the postseason. "We don't take any nights
off, but we feel it pays dividends for us in the long run," said Hart following
Beavercreek's 43-27 defeat of the Knights last Saturday. "(Beavercreek plays) a
matchup (defense) that we see maybe once or twice a year. And they play it
probably better than anybody in the area. You put all that together and the fact
we're young and inexperienced kind of adds up to what we saw." What Hart saw too
often was the Knights forfeiting offensive possessions without taking a shot.
Creek's defensive pressure limited Alter to 12 first-half shots. "That should be
a quarter, not a half," said Hart.

ROW, ROW, ROW . . .

A team of area rowers representing the Greater Dayton Rowing Association won the
4-man boat competition at the 31st Bill Braxton Memorial Regatta in Philadelphia
on Nov. 13-14. The Dayton team defeated several highly ranked East Coast high
schools and prep schools in the event held on the Schuylkill River. The winning
team included Kevin Komiensky and Bryan Little from Chaminade-Julienne, James
Heuser of Centerville, Ben Downey who is home schooled with Anastasia Gomez of
C-J as the coxswain. A second Dayton 4s team was third, consisting of David
Crooke who is home schooled, Brandon Walz of Oakwood, Ryan McClain and Michael
Little of Oakwood with Francesca Gomez of C-J as the coxswain. The Dayton
women's 4s team was elmininated in the prelims. That team included Moriah
Pendergrass who is home schooled, Rachel Watson of Centerville, Alicia Gomez and
Lily Conroy of C-J with Ben Hershey of Oakwood as the coxswain.

GCL North foes prepare Alter;
Tough conference schedule readies Knights for final four.;
DIVISION II SEMIFINALS

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

There's no better way for Greater Catholic League girls basketball teams to
prepare for the postseason than churning through a conference schedule.

GCL North Division rivals Alter, Chaminade Julienne and Carroll all have
advanced to the state Division II high school semifinals in three of the last
four seasons. Alter went from 2008-10 and is back again this week.

CJ qualified for the final four last season, and Carroll did so in 2011.
Southwestern Buckeye League rep Bellbrook broke the GCL streak in 2012.

"The league is very good and has been for several years," Alter coach Chris Hart
said. "There's very good coaching in the league."

Alter (28-0) kicks off the three-day final four by playing Toledo Rogers (24-4)
at 1 p.m. today at Ohio State University's Schottenstein Center in Columbus.

Millersburg West Holmes (27-0) plays Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary (25-2) in the
other semifinal at 3 p.m.

The winners will play for the state title at 10:45 a.m. Saturday.

Also seeking state titles are Fort Loramie and Versailles. Loramie (26-2) plays
Reedsville Eastern (25-1) at 8 p.m. today in a D-IV semi. Loramie is the D-IV
defending state champion.

Versailles (23-3) will face Proctorville Fairland (22-3) in a D-III semi at 3
p.m. Friday.

The Divisions I, III and IV state titles games also are Saturday, all at the
Schottenstein Center.

Alter beat Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown to win its only D-II state title in
2008.

Loramie lost just three seniors from last season's state title team and has a
senior-laden team this season. That made for Redskins' great expectations and
they've delivered.

"This year was a tough year at times," Loramie coach Carla Siegel said. "We
talked about ... not worrying about the past or the future. This is their senior
year and this is the year that they'll remember forever. They're very clear and
focused on what they want to do this weekend."

Versailles' lineup also is dominated by seniors. This is the fourth team in 11
seasons that coach Jacki Stonebraker has taken to state.

? The Divisions I, III and IV state titles games will be carried live on
SportsTime Ohio. The D-II title game will air on Time Warner Cable
SportsChannel.

? A live webcast of today's Alter game will be carried on ihigh.com/ goknights.

Alter crowns unbeaten season with title;
Knights put loss last year in championship game behind them.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL ALTER 57, ROGERS 42

BYLINE: By Eric Frantz

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 702 words


Alter's Jocelyn Meyer (left) and Maddie Bazelak embrace after the Knights
defeated Rogers 57-42 to win the D-II state championship at the Schottenstein
Center on Saturday.

Alter guard Braxtin Miller leads a fast break during the Knights' 57-42 victory
over Rogers on Saturday. Miller, a sophomore guard, scored 11 points.

COLUMBUS - Alter found itself in an unfamiliar place Saturday - ahead
comfortably at halftime.

Trailing Toledo Rogers after two quarters in last year's Division II state
semifinal and ahead by one in this year's regular-season rematch at Classic in
the Country, the Knights ran their record to 3-0 against the Rams and added a
second state title with a 57-42 win at Ohio State's Value City Arena in the
Division II girls final.

Alter finishes 30-0.

Needing OT to beat Rogers 48-47 earlier this season and having to rally from an
eight-point deficit in last year's state semifinal, there was no need for
dramatics this time.

Much like it has all season, Alter left little doubt as to who the best team was
once the ball was tipped. The 15-point margin of victory was Alter's closest in
the postseason.

"We're not the best team to ever play in the OHSAA, but our accomplishments this
year rank with the best," Alter co-head coach Kendal Peck said. "We beat seven
Division I teams that were ranked in the state top 10 at one point or another
this season. We beat Rogers twice and they may be the most talented team in the
state. I hate when coaches say 'we're the best' or 'we're the greatest' and I'm
not saying that - but we're in the conversation."

The undefeated state championship is the first for a girls team from Montgomery
County and the first from the immediate area since Beaver-creek went 28-0 en
route to winning D-I titles in 1995 and 2001. Alter is the first area team to
finish 30-0.

The victory also helped quell the distaste of last year's 62-45 D-II state final
loss to West Holmes. The Knights are 59-1 since the start of the 2013-14 season.

"Let's understand something right from the beginning," Alter co-head coach Chris
Hart said. "(Rogers) is really, really good. They are athletic as they come and
until (Akienreh Johnson) got hurt all five of their starters had committed to
D-I schools. That tells you all you need to know about their program. We give
them all the respect in the world. But our kids are pretty competitive and
pretty determined. They have big hearts and got in there and scrapped."

Rogers twice held six-point leads in the first half, but the Knights closed the
second quarter with a 9-0 run to lead 27-22 at the break.

Emma Bockrath's basket off an assist from Jocelyn Meyer with three seconds to go
fueled the halftime fire.

"We went to the locker room thinking we were world beaters," Peck said. "That
was a great pass and finish and was huge. There's a big difference between being
up three and being up five. We came out in the third quarter and really kept
that momentum."

Alter opened the second half with an 8-2 run.

Rogers climbed to within three late in the third quarter, but another 10-1 spurt
gave the Knights a 46-34 lead with 7:07 to play. The lead never dropped below
double digits after that.

Rogers (23-6) was without Johnson, a Michigan commit, but still fielded a
starting five that featured two more Michigan commits, a Xavier recruit and a
Cincinnati commit.

Didn't matter.

Alter's fundamentals trumped Rogers' talent.

Bockrath led the Knights with 21 points, while Maddie Bazelak had 11 points and
eight rebounds. Sophomore point guard Braxtin Miller scored 11 points and played
a large part in flustering Rogers point guard and Michigan recruit Bre
Hampton-Bey who had eight points, five turnovers and four fouls.

Alter forced 21 turnovers and outscored the Rams 23-6 in points off turnovers.

"If we would have gone 29-1 again I think we all would have been pretty
devastated," Peck said. "We'd have been 58-2 in two years and those 'two' would
have been remembered for the rest of our lives."

Said Rogers head coach Lamar Smith: "They put a lot pressure on our guards. Give
them credit. They're a great team. They're the No. 1 team in Ohio - even in
Division I."

1987 Alter soccer team among athletic Hall inductees

BYLINE: DAVE LAMB HERE AND THERE

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-8

LENGTH: 532 words


Two decades after they won Alter High School's first state soccer championship
in dramatic fashion, the 1987 boys' team has once again earned the spotlight.

That team, along with acclaimed athletes Andrea D'Innocenzo, Theresa Yingling
Plunkett and Jerry Rudzinski, will be inducted into Alter's Athletic Hall of
Fame on Friday at the Presidential Banquet Center in Kettering.

Alter also will honor distinguished alumni Dr. Mark Romer, Dr. Annette Chavez
and Diane Butler-Hughes. Lois Ulrich, former longtime Lancerette director, also
will be recognized.

The 1987 soccer team won the state Class AAA title, 2-1, over Stow Walsh Jesuit,
with Tom Muzechuck's goal with 93 seconds remaining in the title match.

In the semifinals, Alter defeated Wayne, 1-0, on a goal by Ore Mahoney, with
Terry Graham providing the assist.

The Knights posted 17 shutouts in a 21-3-2 season. They outscored opponents 16-2
in eight tournament games, six of them shutout wins with Ben Pickrel in goal.

* Andrea D'Innocenzo, a 1992 graduate, earned 10 varsity letters in soccer,
basketball and softball.

She earned her greatest acclaim in softball, earning All-America honors and
playing in the College World Series at the University of Connecticut.

D'Innocenzo played four years in the Women's Professional Softball League and
was a two-time all-star.

She also played a professional season in Parma, Italy.

* Theresa Yingling Plunkett, a 1982 graduate, was an All-Ohio basketball player
and a state qualifier in the long jump.

She became the second Alter basketball player to reach 1,000 points and stands
fifth on the career scoring list at the University of Dayton.

* Jerry Rudzinski, a 1994 graduate, was a two-time All-Ohio football player who
became a standout linebacker at Ohio State.

At Alter, Rudzinski was named AP Ohio defensive player of the year. He was also
a three-year letterman in basketball, and helped the Knights reach the Final
Four.

A three-year starter at linebacker at Ohio State, Rudzinski served as captain in
1998.

In addition to helping the Buckeyes reached No. 2 nationally in two seasons,
Rudzinski was a two-time GTE Academic All-American and selected as the football
team's most inspirational senior.

Hastings man hit, killed while recycling cans at St. Paul facility

BYLINE: By John Brewer and Mara H. Gottfried Pioneer Press

SECTION: DAKOTA COUNTY; Ramsey County; Minnesota-Twin Cities; Local

LENGTH: 280 words


An 85-year-old Hastings man who recycled cans as a retirement hobby was killed
Thursday when he was hit by a skid loader at a St. Paul metal recycling company,
police said Friday.

Jack Patrick McCoy was unloading cans from the rear of his pickup truck at Alter
Metal Recycling, 801 Barge Channel Road, when an employee driving the skid
loader accidentally backed into him, said St. Paul police officer John Keating,
a department spokesman.

Police were called about the accident at 1:39 p.m. Paramedics responded and
McCoy was pronounced dead at the scene, Keating said.

Neither drugs nor alcohol were believed a factor in the accident, police said.
Police did not arrest or cite the driver.

Bob Ellis, vice president and general counsel with Alter, said the company is
cooperating fully with local law enforcement and is conducting its own
investigation into the accident.

"First and foremost, we want to say it's a very unfortunate and tragic
accident," he said.

One of McCoy's sons, Kent McCoy, said his father retired years ago from 3M's
Chemolite plant in Cottage Grove, where he worked in the warehouse. He spent
part of his retirement collecting and recycling cans "as a hobby," his son said.

Every couple of months, he'd make a trip to Alter to drop off his booty, Kent
McCoy said.

Jack McCoy is survived by his wife, Betty, 81, six sons and two daughters.

Alter Metal Recycling's St. Paul site is one of five in Minnesota and 32 spread
over seven other states: Alabama, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska and Wisconsin.

Day of the Dead goes home -- to a cemetery in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By Joe Rodriguez jrodriguez@mercurynews.com

SECTION: BREAKING; Communities; San Jose - Valley; News; Local; Entertainment;
Lifestyle; Religion

LENGTH: 921 words


This time of year, miniature, sombrero-wearing skeletons and their bony
girlfriends are dancing and flirting on memorial altars at schools, colleges,
museums and at just about any public place with sense of cultural humor. Day of
the Dead, the ancient and mystical Mexican celebration of death, has gone
mainstream.

The problem is, the celebrations rarely take place where there are "... well
"... dead people. The Day of the Dead is too often wasted on the living.

Calvary Catholic Cemetery in East San Jose hopes to change that Saturday. The
historic cemetery will hold its first official celebration with the goal of
growing it into the premier Day of the Dead event in San Jose. But that doesn't
mean anything goes.

"We would like to keep it cultural and spiritual," said Nicole Lecheler,
marketing director for the cemeteries run by the Diocese of San Jose. "There
won't be any commercialism."

Cemetery officials figure they have the most dramatic place. Opened in 1882,
Calvary features exquisitely carved, tall tombstones and magnificent family
mausoleums housing above ground. The 26-acre cemetery is packed with about
25,000 remains and history.

Louis Pellier, the Frenchman who introduced the prune to the valley, was buried
there. Rich or poor, famous or not, the city's early Italian, Portuguese, Irish,
Spanish and Mexicans buried their loved ones here.

The free daytime event will feature ritual, music and dance. An Aztec dance
company will summon the spirits with incense. Community groups and Catholic
schools will put up skeletons or memorial altars splashed with yellow marigolds,
the ancient symbol for the beauty and fragility of life. Artists will paint
faces and show kids how to make playful skulls.

Most important, Calvary is inviting families to decorate the grave sites of
relatives, which is more the custom in Mexico than here, and is encouraging
visitors to come dressed for the occasion in skeleton garb, face paint or masks,
but without the ghoul and gore associated with Halloween.

"We don't want bloody Halloween costumes," said Suzanne Young, the outreach
director for the Catholic cemeteries.

The cemetery has been working with the nearby Mexican American Community
Services Agency and Latino artists to keep the observation as authentic as
possible given the different approaches the special day receives in each
country.

In Mexico, where the tradition began about 30 centuries ago, Mexican families
generally keep the day mostly private but still festive. They place photos of
loved ones and morsels of their favorite foods or drink on home altars next to
sugar skulls, or they go to cemeteries and decorate Nana's grave in much the
same way. The idea is to invite the spirits to share some time and space with
the living.

Here, Day of the Dead has been celebrated mostly in public ever since Chicano
students in the 1960s adopted the holiday and a relatively minor one -- Cinco de
Mayo -- to reaffirm their cultural identity. That's why we see so many photos of
Che Guevara, Cesar Chavez, Frida Kahlo and other heroes of the Chicano movement
on public altars.

Local Catholic churches, including St. Joseph Cathedral in downtown San Jose,
have allowed Day of the Dead celebrations for years, but this is first time one
of its cemeteries plans to do it up big. That's no small step for a church that
once tried to snuff out the celebration.

Dating back 3,000 years, the Mayans and other Mesoamerican peoples celebrated
the Day of the Dead during the month of August. After the conquest, the Spanish
condensed the event and moved it to align with Catholic All Saints Day on Nov. 1
and All Souls Day on Nov. 2.

Most of the action at Calvary will take place in the parking lot or in the
cemetery section named for Juan Diego, the Aztec to whom the Lady of Guadalupe
is said to have appeared shortly after the conquest of Mexico. That's where a
lot of Latino families choose to bury their dead. As an extra attraction,
Calvary staff will give free tours of the historic cemetery.

The Rev. Jon Pedigo, a Catholic priest who organized his first Day of the Dead
event in 1991 at St. Catherine Church in Morgan Hill, said it's no longer seen
within the faith as a pagan ritual.

"It represents the cycle of life and death," he said. "We see that as part and
parcel in the teachings of the church."

Just days ago, if C. Virginia Fields, a City Council incumbent, and William
Perkins, a grass-roots campaigner for the Council, had met on the street, they
would have greeted each other as candidates in adjoining Harlem districts. But
yesterday, when their paths crossed on the northern stretch of Fifth Avenue that
once separated their districts, they found themselves rivals for the same job.

A revised plan that the city's Districting Committee completed on Friday and
rushed off to Washington won approval within hours from Justice Department
officials. But the new lines failed to satisfy many of the people who criticized
the original plan and brought new complaints from candidates who, like Mrs.
Fields and Mr. Perkins, were affected by the shift in some lines.

Balloting May Still Be Threatened

Racing toward a September primary and a Nov. 5 general election that would
expand the City Council to 51 seats from 35, the city cleared a big hurdle by
winning approval of the revised districting map a week after the original one
was rejected as unfair to Hispanic voters. But lawsuits, pending and threatened,
may still block the balloting.

"My lawyer is going to file suit to stop this election," Mr. Perkins, the Deputy
Chief Clerk of the Manhattan Board of Elections, said yesterday.

Until Friday, he was a candidate in East Harlem's District 8, one of three
districts criticized by the Justice Department in rejecting the original
political map. In the adjustments to satisfy the Federal agency, Mr. Perkins's
apartment building, the Schomburg Plaza housing complex on the east side of
Fifth Avenue at Frawley Street, and his candidacy were shifted to District 9.

Mr. Perkins's lawyer, Douglas Kellner, said yesterday that his client might also
join a Federal lawsuit filed by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education
Fund, a Manhattan-based voter advocacy group that wants the elections delayed.

Confusion in Brooklyn

The new boundaries also throw several races in Brooklyn into confusion,
especially involving Susan D. Alter, a 13-year Council incumbent.

In the original plan, Ms. Alter was moved from District 44 in the East Flatbush
section that was her power base and into the adjoining 44th District, where
another incumbent, Noach Dear, has stronger support.

When the lines were redrawn last week, Ms. Alter was placed in yet another
district, the 40th in Crown Heights, which has no incumbent but three announced
candidates.

"It's really not fair," said Ms. Alter, who has sued to have the original plan
changed to put her back into her old district. "We did not start at the starting
gate at the same time."

Ms. Alter's shift from the 44th could be a boon for Mr. Dear, and a disaster for
the other candidate in the district, Robert Miller, a lawyer who had been
counting on Ms. Alter and Mr. Dear to split the vote.

Her move into the 40th can also be seen as bad news for the three politically
untested black candidates in Crown Heights -- Carl Andrews, Una Clark, and
Maurice Gumbs.

By moving Ms. Alter to the Crown Heights district instead of her old stronghold,
the commission left the race in Flatbush an open contest between seven minority
candidates, among them Colin Moore, a prominent defense lawyer, and James T.
Conolly, the local Democratic district leader.

Many of the political players fretted about what ground rules a three-judge
panel of the Federal district court might lay down on Tuesday for new
candidates.

In District 34 in Williamsburg, the commission's changes are not likely to
dislodge the incumbent, Victor L. Robles, from the front-runner's spot. With the
support of Congressman Edolphus Towns and the Democratic Party committee, he
faces no stiff opposition. In the adjoining 37th District, the new lines cut one
candidate, Michael Nieves, a school board member, out of the race, leaving the
field to Mauricio Hernandez, a lawyer supported by Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez,
and Martin Malave-Dilan, a longtime aide to Congressman Towns who is favored by
the county Democratic organization.

Unless new candidates enter the field, the new boundaries will probably not skew
the election in District 21 in Queens either, where Assemblywoman Helen M.
Marshall is still viewed as the strongest candidate, said Congressman Thomas J.
Manton, the Queens County Democratic leader.

Hispanic groups criticized the commission's first version of the district
because it included the predominately black Lefrak City, which they saw as an
attempt to increase the fortunes of Ms. Marshall, who is black and has
represented the area as an Assemblywoman for several years.

In the revision, the commission removed Lefrak City, placing it in the mostly
white District 25, leaving the 21st District with 38 percent hite, 33 percent
black and 24 percent Hispanic registered voters. Ms. Marshall faces a white
restaurateur, Judy Weiner, and a black clergyman, the Rev. Irvine Brier.

Alter, Dunbar advance to semis;
HIGH SCHOOLSBOYS BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

DAYTON - An errant elbow? Some trash talk? An isolation challenge? Just another
Friday night for Alter's Jaaron Sim-mons.

"It's been like that all season," said the go-to senior guard. "I'm getting kind
of used to it."

It's still too early to tag Alter a team of destiny, but the Knights are getting
more comfy with that, too. The Knights delayed veteran coach Joe Petrocelli's
retirement yet again, beating Wilmington 66-56 in one of three Division II boys
high school basketball district finals at UD Arena on Friday.

Joining Alter in next week's D-II regional semifinals at Fairmont's Trent Arena
is Dunbar, which derailed Shawnee 67-54 in the nightcap. Hughes eliminated
Trotwood-Madison in an opening 96-86 shootout.

Alter will play Marion-Franklin at 5:30 p.m. in Thursday's regional semi opener.
Dunbar gets Hughes in the 8 p.m. nightcap.

Alter once again wisely deferred to Simmons. He hit 13 of 17 shots and tallied a
game-high 33 points. In Alter's previous shocker of No. 1-ranked Thurgood
Marshall, he rang up 29 points.

"You gotta give him credit, he's carrying these guys on his shoulders and we've
got good, other players," Petrocelli said.

Dunbar overcame a strong Shawnee start with a balanced attack, led by William
Green's 21 points and Damarion Get-er's 14 points and 13 rebounds.

The Wolverines (20-6) were in control by halftime and never allowed Shawnee back
into contention. But there was no stopping senior Jaelin Williams. He hit 8 of
11 shots for a game-high 25 points and had nine rebounds.

The only thing that was ailing Trotwood was a defensive meltdown that led to a
superb high game of 30 points by the smallest player on the court, Big Red 5-8
senior guard Angel Rivera.

The Rams (22-4) cruised through their Springfield sectional, but the postseason
stakes were ramped up against Cincinnati Metro Conference member Hughes.

Ravonn Lovett led Trot-wood with 23 points. Chris Mack added 19 and Andre Foster
17. Rivera, a second-year move-in from Puerto Rico, nailed a trio of threes and
buried 19 of 22 free throws.

Alter-Fairmont kicks off prep football spotlight

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 336 words


The battle of Kettering has raged for several decades on the football field. So
what better way to kick off the 2005 Game of the Week schedule than with
Fairmont against Alter.

Led by coach Ed Domsitz, the Knights are coming off another playoff appearance
and a 9-3 record. The Greater Catholic League North champions had won three
straight in this rivalry before last season.

Brian Blevins' Fairmont Firebirds had a big turnaround last year, improving from
2-8 to 7-3. Last season they started off with a 21-16 victory over Alter at
Foreman Field.

The field and stands have undergone a facelift (with more to come) but the
rivalry doesn't need any improvement. The teams play for the Charles Kettering
starter award, which goes to the team that stands at 1-0 after this Friday.

* Picking the game: Many factors are used to determine which three games will be
voted on. They include team records, Dayton Daily News ratings, traditional
rivalries, how close the game could be, impact on the league and playoff chase.
The winner is the game with the most votes. The Alter-Fairmont game had a big
lead early this week. But the Carroll-Beavercreek matchup picked up steam,
especially on the WHIO-TV Web site. But at the buzzer, Alter-Fairmont won on
both ballots, including a wide margin at DaytonDailyNews.com.

* Finer points: The key matchup could be Alter All-Ohio linebacker Matt
Krystofic against Fairmont workhorse runner Cameron Campeau. The senior running
back had a big day against the Knights last year.

* Fan friendly: The Dayton Daily News will provide fan favors while WHIO-TV
Sports Director Mike Hartsock will deliver the Tuffy Brooks game balls prior to
kickoff via Chopper 7.

* Head to head: Tune in to Channel 7 at 6 p.m. each Thursday when Hartsock and
DDN sports reporter Mark Gokavi make their predictions on the Game of the Week
and two other matchups. Hartsock won the first meeting in 2002 but Gokavi
claimed victory in 2003 and 2004 to hold a 2-1 season lead. Touchdown 7 coverage
is at 11:15 p.m. Friday.

Water park eases the wait;
Area girls basketball teams staying at a hotel that offers plenty of recreation.

COLUMBUS - With blizzard conditions battering Ohio and nearly 16 inches of snow
surrounding them, the high school girls basketball players from both Alter and
Versailles weren't thinking sleds. They were thinking slides.

The Ohio High School Athletic Association assigns teams their hotels for the
state tournament. Alter, Versailles and Lakota West were lucky enough to land at
the Fort Rapids Indoor Water Park. That's where most of the players spent the
morning on Saturday, March 8.

"At first we thought it might be a big distraction for us," Versailles assistant
coach Joe Raterman said of first hearing of their hotel.

Instead it became an unexpected break from the boredom. Both Alter and
Versailles planned to spend Saturday hanging out, playing board games the
Knights brought along. The Tigers also held a limbo contest and, yes, ventured
outside to play in the snow.

"A few of them are out playing," Raterman said. "They're making the most of the
situation."

But after Saturday it's back to business. Alter and Versailles are trying to
find high school gyms to practice in today. Versailles coach Jacki Raterman said
she might take the Tigers to watch the Ohio State men's basketball team play
Michigan State today at the Schottenstein Center. That's the same court the
state tournament is held on.

"We've kicked around the idea of going to the men's game to get them back in the
arena, to let them see the atmosphere and get back in the flow," Versailles
coach Jacki Stonebraker said. "And just to do something."

Slippery situation

The OHSAA waited until Saturday morning to postpone the tournament. With the
final eight teams already in town as well as many of the fans, some wondered if
the games could have gone on. But with a dozen surrounding counties at Level 3
snow emergencies, that wasn't an option.

"We were out there clearing off the cars and I can certainly understand it,"
said Bob Westerkamp, whose daughter Kelly is a freshman on Alter's team. "Both
teams are in town so on one hand you kind of want to say 'why don't they just
play the game?' But on the other hand, it's a Level 3 and nobody's allowed to be
out moving anyway. Short of breaking the law I guess it's the right decision."

Worth the wait

Alter coach Christina Hart has waited 14 seasons to reach the state finals. So
how is she handling the weatherinduced delay?

"Honestly, we've waited all these years to get here so what's a couple more
days?" Hart said on Saturday. "There's not a whole lot you can do with this
weather."

Alter (24-3) plays Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown (22-4) for the Division II
title at 10:45 a.m. Versailles (27-0) plays Sugarcreek Garaway (25-2) at 5:15
p.m. for the Division III championship.

Neither Alter nor Versailles has won a girls basketball state title.

Crowd control

The only thing harder than finding a snow scraper at Target was finding students
to fill out the cheering sections for Friday's state semifinal games. Crowds
were sparse during the tournament's second day of action. They weren't expected
to be much better Saturday.

"I think they will be better (Monday) than if we played today," Hart said. "I
don't think we're going to get much of a crowd. That's disappointing."

Said Alter freshman Kaila Howe: "We were mentally ready to play today. I guess
it's good we have a couple more days to prepare. It sounds like we'll have our
fans there to watch us. I was worried we wouldn't have anybody."

An official statement

Teams aren't the only ones that have to rearrange their schedules. Basketball
officials are also making plans to return Monday. Springfield's Pam Stewart, a
16-year veteran, will work the D-III final. It's her third state tournament
game.

"Oh my gosh, yes. Absolutely," Stewart said of the honor of being selected.
"It's one of those games we get a fee for doing, but we would work for free."

Stewart arrived in Columbus on Thursday to watch the semifinals. She's been
stuck at the Holiday Inn on Lane Avenue since Friday. She planned on heading for
home Saturday afternoon before returning Monday.

Staying put

A few cars tried heading for home Saturday morning. Stonebraker said the Tigers
discussed getting out Friday, but elected to stay. There was no such talk
Saturday.

"We didn't even think about trying to leave today," she said. "We did kick it
around for tomorrow. But it doesn't sound like the situation is going to be much
better with the wind blowing."

Versailles athletic director Randy Swisher helped dig out several cars Saturday
morning. He even got heckled for it by some Garaway players - that's the Tigers'
state final opponent - through the hotel windows.

"I was getting chastised from Garaway's team up here in the (hotel) window,"
Swisher said. "They saw my Versailles coat and were mocking me."

Alter sweeps West Holmes to reach state title match

BYLINE: By Debbie Juniewicz and Dave Long Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 393 words


It will be a battle of the topranked teams in the Division II state final today
as No. 1 Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit High School (27-1) will face off against
25-3 Alter for the state championship.

Alter sped through the DII semifinals in an hour with a quick 25-18, 25-18,
25-11 win over Millersburg West Holmes, the same team the Knights defeated to
win both the 2002 and 2003 state championships.

While most of the Knights are state rookies, it's the veteran coaching staff
that has been nervous this week.

"The girls just want to play," Alter coach Tina Jasinowski said. "They are
motivated and prepared."

The same is true of the Knights' final opponent, because Walsh Jesuit is back
for the championship it lost last year to Roger Bacon.

No one talked about state during the regular season, but every Warrior wanted a
return trip to the Nutter Center.

"Going to state has been our goal ever since we were here last year," Walsh
coach Missy Christ said. "We just didn't talk about it."

Division III

Anna had visions of the 2005 D-III state semifinals in the first game of an
18-25, 25-14, 25-13, 25-19 win over Albany Alexander on Friday.

Last season, the Rockets just seemed happy to be in the big show, losing to
eventual state champion Cleveland Villa Angela-St. Joseph, 25-16, 25-20, 25-16
in the semifinals.

That same attitude seemed to prevail in the opening game.

"We were certainly more ready to play than they were the opening game," said
Alexander coach Brad Jeffers. "But we couldn't keep the momentum going. ... They
were able to find our weak spots, and when they did, they were very efficient."

Anna's weak spot was in the first game where several serves and kills produced
Alexander points. "Not the way we wanted to start the state," said Anna coach
Karen Zumberger.

Division I

As usual, it's all Cincinnati all the time in the big school division. This time
it will be two schools from the Girls Greater Cincinnati League Scarlet Division
squaring off for the state title, but more important - bragging rights.

Mother of Mercy (24-4) meets Mount Notre Dame (22-5). Mercy finished No. 1 in
the final state poll, while Mount Notre Dame was tied for third.

The schools split in the regular season and tied for the GGCL Scarlet
championship with 7-3 records.

Today's game will mark the fourth time in six years two Cincinnati teams have
met for the state title.

It'll be a first: Oakwood likely to draw Alter

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 394 words


Alter and neighboring Oakwood have a deep history of playing each other "only in
the country club sports," said Lumberjacks football coach Paul Stone.

Add a historical high school football playoff date.

Unbeaten Alter and Oakwood (7-3) will likely be paired in this week's Division
IV playoffs. The Ohio High School Athletic Association will announce the
official pairings at 2 p.m. today.

Many Web sites that track Ohio's teams already have calculated the pairings. The
five-week postseason begins at 7:30 p.m. Friday with the higher seeded Division
II, III and V teams hosting. At 7 p.m. on Saturday, it'll be Divisions I, IV and
VI playing.

Alter, the D-III state runner-up last season, romped to another 10-0 regular
season.

Oakwood hadn't won a Week 10 game in eight years. The Jacks had to beat Franklin
(31-7) to snap that skid and a three-game slide to extend their season.

"It's just one of those years," Stone said. "A lot of would-haves, could-haves
and you just move on.

"I hope our kids have a good competitive nature. We've got to make our breaks
and do everything right. And hope they decide to put the ball on the turf a
little bit. You never know," he said.

* Centerville (8-2) knows plenty about its likely firstround opponent: visiting
Princeton (8-2). The Elks fell 43-42 in the finals seconds in a Week 2 game at
Princeton.

"That's why our players were pleased at the pairings," Centerville coach Ron
Ullery said. "We were a little bit disappointed the first time."

* Same for Trotwood-Madison (7-3). The D-II Rams should be at Edgewood, which
has knocked the Rams out of the playoffs twice. T-M likely missed playing
Carroll (9-1) by one position. The Pats instead should be at Cincinnati Withrow
(9-1).

"Could we expect anything less?" said Rams coach Maurice Douglass.

"We'll exchange with Withrow for one order of Edgewood."

* No area league fared better than the Southwestern Buckeye League, which
advance a staggering seven teams to the postseason. Advancing were Oakwood,
Milton-Union, Brookville, Waynesville, Monroe, Eaton and even 5-5 Valley View.

Here's to strength of schedule.

* Wayne (8-2), Parkway (8-2) and Indian Lake (6-4) all drew the dreaded No. 9
positions. Only the top eight in each region advance.

Indian Lake missed out to Ross by just .04 in the computer formula.

Alter Bridge's struggles with faith result in strongest album yet

BYLINE: By David Burger The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: FEATURES

LENGTH: 545 words


You might consider Creed more of a blues-based rock band, while Alter Bridge has
more of a modern-rock and metal vibe. But both bands consider questions of faith
the foundation for their music.

Alter Bridge was born in 2004 in Orlando after Creed crumbled, despite selling
more than 30 million albums worldwide. Two Creed members, guitarist Mark
Tremonti and drummer Scott Phillips, invited former Creed bassist Brian Aubrey
Marshall into a new band named after a bridge in Tremonti's hometown.

The band then recruited Myles Kennedy, formerly of the Mayfield Four, as lead
singer and co-songwriter. The new band replicated much of Creed's success in the
rock world.

But in 2009, Kennedy found himself questioning God, and those questions spurred
the music found on "AB III," the band's most recent album, released in October.
It's "centered around a lot of questions and internal soul-searching that I have
been going through for some time," he said.

Tremonti, who writes with Kennedy, found out Kennedy's father was a Christian
Scientist, who because of his faith had refused to see a doctor and subsequently
died. "I told him, 'You have to believe in something,' " said Tremonti, a
Christian.

The musicians worked together to finish "AB III." Although the album is much
darker than the band's previous material, it's also Alter Bridge's finest hour.

"We were really surprised with how quickly the crowds became familiar with the
new material," Kennedy said. The band launched a European and British tour a few
days after its release and were surprised to find "people were already singing
along like they had the record for years."

Besides issues of faith, many of the lyrics grew out of frustration with the
music industry. "AB III" was released worldwide (excluding North America) on
Roadrunner Records, making the album Alter Bridge's third consecutive album to
be released on a different record label. "For me, it was more of a defiant
attitude," Tremonti said of many of the lyrics. "We were going through problems
with record labels and business drama. We had a 'how dare you?' attitude."

But hope is never far from the musician's mind. "We're not dark people," he
insisted. "We go through dark times."

Fans should expect a tight performance and a focused show in the band's first
Utah appearance. That's thanks to Tremonti and Kennedy's self-proclaimed
perfectionism, what they term is the "fresh perspective" of Phillips, the
drummer, as well as Marshall's creative bass lines.

That music-focused camaraderie is shared in their approach to performance. "When
we perform live, we try not to get out of hand with production and lights,
etc.," Kennedy said. "We spend so much time trying to craft good tunes that we
don't want to dilute the presentation with visual gimmicks. It's all about the
songs."

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A Change in Administration At a Cable TV Trade Group

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

SECTION: Section D; Page 7; Column 3; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 610 words


The Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, in the first change in its top
administrative job since its founding a decade ago, has named a president and
chief executive with extensive experience in broadcast television and radio as
well as in cable.

Thomas E. McKinney, 49 years old, who has been executive vice president since
July of last year, is succeeding Robert H. Alter, 62, who becomes a vice
chairman of what is the cable industry's national advertising trade association.

Mr. McKinney is believed to be the first black executive to head such a media or
advertising organization.

"Cable has played a great role in changing the television medium," Mr. McKinney
said in an interview last week before the bureau's board elected him president.
"Now, we must make this medium easy to use for advertisers of all levels and
sizes."

Mr. Alter, who joined Mr. McKinney for the interview at the bureau's midtown
Manhattan office, called him "the right man at the right time to take over."

Thomas F. Burchill, the bureau's chairman, concurred. Mr. McKinney "knows how to
lead," said Mr. Burchill, who is president and chief executive of
Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services, owner of cable properties like the
Lifetime network. "I'm delighted Thom is getting his shot to propel the
organization forward."

Mr. McKinney said that when he joined the bureau, the expectation was that he
would become president in about three years. But, Mr. Alter said, "Thom is
ready, and there were other opportunities I had. It all came together." In
addition to serving as a consultant to the bureau, Mr. Alter will be advising on
starting Star TV, a Pan-Asian satellite television programming service based in
Hong Kong.

When the bureau began operations in 1981, "we started with a budget of $250,000
and two people," recalled Mr. Alter, who came there after more than two decades
at the Radio Advertising Bureau.

"Now, we have a budget of over $4 million," Mr. McKinney said, "and a staff of
26 -- and growing."

That growth at the bureau, which represents 32 national cable networks as well
as owners of groups of local cable systems known as multiple system operators,
reflects the booming growth of cable advertising.

According to statistics compiled by Paul Kagan Associates, a consulting firm,
cable ad revenue has been soaring, reaching $2.55 billion last year, compared
with $230 million in 1982. The forecast for this year, despite the recession
that is battering most other media, is for a 19 percent increase, to more than
$3 billion.

Even so, "our revenue hasn't caught up yet with our shares" of the total viewing
audience, Mr. McKinney said. In order to fuel additional gains, he added, the
bureau ought to "make sure advertisers know what kind of cable programming is
out there" -- that is, to familiarize advertisers seeking to target their ad
messages to specific consumer groups with the cable programming those consumers
watch.

Mr. McKinney has become a familiar figure within his industry, through his work
as an executive for Group W Cable, once the industry's third-largest multiple
system operator, and for the bureau, which honored him with a President's Award
in 1986. Still, he is aware that reaching a level apparently not achieved before
by a black media or advertising executive will bring him recognition beyond the
world of cable.

"That is why I feel that extra pressure to do an outstanding job," he said.
"Perhaps this will start to change attitudes, and somebody else might say, 'Now
it's O.K. for me to take a chance.' "

Rather than see "a glass ceiling," he added, "you can find a way to break
through that sucker."

Alter takes 3,200 relay

BYLINE: Staff Report

LENGTH: 255 words


Alter took an early lead and held it on the way to winning the girls 3,200-meter
relay for the fourth straight year during the opening session of the Dayton
Division II regional track and field meet Thursday, May 27, at Welcome Stadium.

Ashley Rodgers, a junior, teamed with sophomore Olivia Albers, freshman Austin
Borton and junior Rebecca Esselstein to outdistance the field in 9 minutes,
25.72 seconds.

Oakwood was second in 9:33.95 and joined Alter in advancing to the state meet
next week at Ohio State.

Alter will be seeking its second straight state championship in the event.

Moeller bags Elks

Falling behind 7-0 in the first inning dictated against Centerville pulling off
an upset of Cincinnati Moeller in a Division I regional baseball semifinal at
the University of Cincinnati.

Defending state champ Moeller won 8-4, extending its winning streak to 26.

"They're a good team," Centerville coach Terry Dickten said. "I voted them No. 1
in the state five times this year."

Centerville fell despite three RBIs from shortstop Matt Sullivan.

"I told the kids I'm proud of them for sticking in there," Dickten said. "We
were the only team still alive in the area."

Rescheduled

Due to rainy conditions, Bellbrook's baseball team got an extra day of rest
before taking on 30-0 Plain City Jonathan Alder in the Division II regional
semifinals. That game will be played today at 5 p.m. at the University of
Dayton.

At the same time, also at UD, 28-2 Lebanon takes on Lakota East in a Division I
regional softball semifinal postponed Thursday.

Comeback keeps Alter's season alive;
Knights advance to face Aiken in regional semifinal.;
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: ; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 788 words


Alter's Dominic Laravie (15) and Greg Romer defend as Carroll's Beau Austin
shoots in the Knights' D-II district final win at UD Arena.

As the misses mounted, Alter players remained unfazed. The Knights seniors
reminded each other of the magnitude of the moment. And it doesn't get any
greater than playing rival Carroll.

"We knew if we kept our game plan we were still going to win this game," Alter's
Joey Laravie said after a 47-42 comeback win in a boys high school basketball
Division II district final at UD Arena on Sunday.

"No matter if the shots aren't falling, we can get inside to get us going.
That's what we've done all season. I can't describe it. We're not quitters. We
just fight until the end."

Sure enough, Alter went on an unlikely game-ending 17-4 run to extend its
season.

Alter (19-6) will play Aiken (22-3) in a D-II regional semifinal. The game is
scheduled for 8 p.m. Thursday at Fairmont's Trent Arena, but there's a conflict
with Alter's girls, who are scheduled to play Columbus Eastmoor Academy in the
D-II state semifinals in Columbus at 6 that night.

Either the Alter boys or girls game likely will be adjusted by the Ohio High
School Athletic Association - by time, date and/ or location - to accommodate
Alter fans.

Aiken advanced by defeating Urbana 67-55 in the second of three games. Taft
defeated Trot-wood-Madison 77-67 in the finale.

Alter saved its best for last with an unlikely fourth-quarter rally. The Knights
hit just 2 of 15 shots in the first quarter and only one of its 3's in 13
attempts. That enabled Carroll to lead by 10 less than five minutes into the
game and 38-30 with 6:47 remaining. But the Patriots wouldn't score another
field goal and Alter suddenly found its range.

Alter's comeback was complete when freshman Connor Bazelak tipped in his only
bucket midway through the fourth quarter to provide Alter its first lead.

From then it was a parade of free throws. J.P. Schrimpf, Joey Laravie and
Dominic Laravie all hit two free throws apiece in the final three minutes for
the Knights.

Joey Laravie led the Knights with 16 points. His cousin, Dominic Lara-vie, added
10 points.

Carroll (17-8) was led by D.J. Sommers' 12 points and 10 each from Beau Austin
and T.K. Robinson. The teams had split in the regular season, each winning on
the road.

"(Alter Athletic Director Chris Hart) made a joke and said these are the Kardiac
Kids because they'll keep your heart on edge," Knights coach Eric Coulter said.
"They're just resilient. They come back. I don't know how many games we've had
to come from behind and win, but they find a way to win."

Alter is 26-2 in winning district titles, but this is the first with Coulter as
head coach.

It was only the third district title game for Carroll, but the second in three
seasons under head coach Tim Cogan. The Patriots have never won a district
title.

"The bottom line is down the stretch they hit shots two or three possessions in
a row and we were unable to," Cogan said. "A game of that caliber, whoever's
hitting down the stretch is going to win. The program has come a long way in
three years and I like where it's going and I'm excited for our younger kids."

Taft 77, Trot-wood-Madison 67: Its youthful inexperience and a lack of
productive depth finally caught up to Trotwood (23-3). The Rams hit just 14 of
31 free throws and were outscored 26-2 in bench points.

"Sometimes you've got to do things a little different than you normally do to
win a district championship and we didn't," Rams coach Rocky Rock-hold said.
"We've been playing with house money since we went 7-0. Unfortunately, we had to
chuck it all back into the middle (Sunday) and let the house take it back."

Trotwood junior Torrey Patton was brilliant. He had 19 points by halftime and
tallied a game-high 32 to go with 12 rebounds and four steals. Myles Belyeu
added 15 points and Amari Davis 11 points. Justin Stephens was a force
underneath with 11 rebounds and five blocks. All five Rams starters were
underclassmen.

Frank Royles led Taft (21-5) with 23 points. The Falcons will play
Johnstown-Monroe in a D-II regional semi Thursday at Trent.

Aiken 67, Urbana 55: Carlik Jones, the D-II Southwest District player of the
year, scored 29 to supercharge Aiken's game-deciding second half. Marcus Barton
added 18 points and Lonnie Berry 13. It was the 11th straight win for the
Cincinnati Metro Athletic Conference champion.

Urbana (15-7) trailed by one at halftime, but buckled under Aiken's defensive
pressure. Jordan Underwood hit 12 of 14 free throws and led the Hillclimbers
with 25 points. Cameron Log-wood added 12 points and Levi Boettcher seven points
and 13 rebounds.

WEST CHESTER - Indian Hill jumped out early and put an end to Alter's season,
beating the Knights 4-2 in a Division II girls soccer regional semifinal Tuesday
at Lakota West High School.

Indian Hill led in the first half before Alter mounted a comeback.

"Once it was 3-0, it really started hitting us," Alter coach Javier Iriart said.
"We kept calm for a while, then we got one back before the end of the half."

Avalee Hagerty scored for Alter, then Emma Bockrath. The two goals cut Indian
Hill's lead to 3-2 in the second half, but that was as far as the Knights could
get.

"They scored in the fourth when we were really pushing numbers forward," Iriart
said. "The score wasn't a reflection of the game, but they played better than
us, that's for sure."

Alter (13-6-1) won a Greater Cincinnati League title this year and made the
state semifinals last year.

Alter tops Bellbrook in OT

BYLINE: By Matt Goeller Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 341 words


SPRINGBORO - For the second consecutive year, the Alter High School boys soccer
team knocked off Bellbrook in overtime to win the Dayton 1 Division II sectional
title.

Alter junior Conrad Zengel struck the game winner on a 40-yard free kick at
13:12 of the second overtime at CareFlight Field in Springboro to give the
Knights the 2-1 win on Monday.

It's the second time in his career the strong-footed Zengel has netted a
40-yarder.

"Last year, at the (Cincinnati) Elder game on senior day," Zengel said of the
liner, which cleared the outstretched arms of Bellbrook keeper Shane Jabir.

Alter battled from behind in the second half after the two teams played to a
scoreless first 40 minutes.

"Our kids just increased their effort," said Alter coach Bob Ellis. "A lot of
the credit for this win goes to my No. 4 (junior defender Daniel Yuhas). His job
was to mark their outstanding forward Eric Lynch. Danny did a great job.

"That's what gave us the opportunity to win.'

Yuhas, who plays club soccer with Lynch in the spring, said, "You just try to
step in front of him all the time and don't let him get the move on you."

Bellbrook's Alex Feld opened the scoring with a beautiful shot past Alter keeper
John DeRoo at 21: 47 of the second half. Feld took a pass in the box from senior
Sean Cloonan and wheeled to place a low shot into the far right corner of the
net.

Alter tied things at 11: 29, when junior striker Joe Zimmerman controlled a high
bounce from Care-Flight Field turf and muscled it past Jabir. That set the stage
for Zengel's laser in the second overtime.

Alter takes a 9-5-4 record onto district tournament. Bellbrook finished at
15-2-1.

Carroll 3, Fenwick 0: Justin Mitchell, who leads the Greater Catholic League in
goals, notched his 20th of the season in helping Carroll advance in the other
D-II sectional final at Springboro.

Justin Chu and Trae' Collins (assisted by Mitchell) also scored for the
Patriots, who improved to 14-2-2 and will face Bellefontaine at 8 p.m. Thursday
at Monroe High School.

Fenwick ended its season at 9-6-4.

Suit Dismissed Against 'Alter Ego'

BYLINE: Deborah Elkins

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 774  words


An Alexandria U.S. District Court dismisses a lawsuit filed by five
African-American employees who signed Foreign Service Employment Agreements to
work in Afghanistan and who allege they were promised promotions and pay raises
but not provided with raises.

Plaintiffs brought this action solely against the parent corporation on the
theory that the parent controls all of the relevant subsidiaries, including
plaintiffs' direct employer, and therefore can be held liable for the latter's
alleged wrongdoing. Plaintiffs' entire case rests on their alter ego theory of
liability because they have held to their decision not to name DynCorp LLC or
DynCorp FZ-LLC (DIFZ) as parties to this action. Therefore, their ability to
recover depends entirely on their ability to prove that DynCorp LLC's or DynCorp
FZ's actions are attributable to defendant DynCorp Inc. Defendant has continued
to press its argument that plaintiffs have sued the wrong entity in this action.

Even assuming plaintiffs have adequately pleaded facts establishing the
plausibility that DIFZ was merely an alter ego for DynCorp LLC, the Texas
entity, they have not named DynCorp LLC as a defendant. Moreover, they have
clearly failed to allege sufficient facts to make out a plausible claim that
Dyncorp LLC is the alter ego of DynCorp Inc., the Virginia entity, and the only
named defendant. Plaintiffs also have failed to allege sufficient facts to
plausibly show that Dyncorp Inc. had any involvement in the events giving rise
to this action or that it should be liable for the conduct of either DynCorp LLC
or DIFZ, a foreign entity established in Dubai, UAE.

Plaintiffs make these allegations regarding their alter egos claim against
DynCorp Inc.: DynCorp International controlled DIFZ but the real employer and
alter ego was DynCorp International; all of the actions taken against plaintiffs
were done at the instigation of DynCorp International management out of Fort
Worth, Texas, or DynCorp international headquarters in Falls Church, Va.; there
was an integration of operations between DynCorp International Inc. and the
offshore company DIFZ and DynCorp. International; none of the capital structure
or management of DIFZ was independent of the operations of DynCorp
International, and all decisions were made or controlled by DynCorp
International management in the U.S.; and the operations of DynCorp
International and DIFZ were interrelated, and they shared management.

In a second amended complaint, plaintiff alleges DIFZ is the alter ego of
DynCorp International, and is controlled by DynCorp International LLC or DynCorp
International Inc.; Defendant used different entities such as the off shore
entity DIFZ, DynCorp Technical Services and Computer Sciences Corporation to
obtain benefits under government contracts while holding out to plaintiffs that
they were dealing with DynCorp International Inc. or DynCorp International LLC;
and DynCorp International and DynCorp International LLC so control DIFZ as to
make it a mere instrumentality of the corporation, and such control is used for
the purpose of committing fraud.

Taken together in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, these allegations are
insufficient to state a plausible alter ego theory against DynCorp Inc., the
Virginia entity, and they are entirely conclusory.

Although the record shows the Dubai forum selection clauses are unreasonable and
unenforceable, plaintiffs' claims fail for these additional reasons. After
plaintiffs were allegedly promoted and worked for a portion of time without
receiving the accompanying pay raise, they nevertheless signed new Foreign
Service Employment Agreements, which contained a full integration clause
acknowledging that the employee had no prior agreements for other positions or
pay rates and acknowledging that the employee was agreeing to work in the
position and for the pay rate stated in the present FSEA for the effective
length of that FSEA. Therefore, none of plaintiffs' breach of contract claims
state valid claims for relief.

Because all of the material underlying events occurred in Afghanistan, the
limited reach of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 dooms plaintiffs' claims for race
discrimination.

The court also dismisses plaintiffs' claims for negligent and intentional
misrepresentation, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment and quantum meruit.

Harmon v. DynCorp Int'l Inc. (Brinkema) No. 1:13cv1597, Feb. 6, 2015; USDC at
Alexandria, Va. VLW 015-3-085, 29 pp.

TROTWOOD SHOCKER Rams beat state's top team; Alter girls make Final Four

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 328 words


Mighty Cincinnati Moeller is likely wondering about that lump on its noggin'.
Here's a hint: The Crusaders have been Ram-boozled. It didn't shock the world.
But let's declare Trotwood-Madison's 48-45 zinging of Moeller in Friday's boys
high school district basketball final at UD Arena as good enough to light up
this region of the Internet world. "All the way," declared Trotwood's Aaron
Robinson, who put a game-high 16 points on Moeller. "I thought we could beat
them all the way." It's good to think positive. Moeller (21-2) was the defending
state champion, the state's No. 1 team in Division I all season and was ranked
No. 8 nationally. Trotwood (20-4) earns a regional semifinal Wednesday, March 5,
against the Zanesville/Newark winner at Columbus.

* Northmont put 22 points on St. Xavier in Friday's other D-I district final at
UD. Whoops; not near enough.

* New Knoxville has a new battle cry: 23-and-0-yeah! The unbeaten Rangers
walloped Fort Recovery 63-46 in a D-IV district final at Wapakoneta.

Girls basketball

What's next for the Knights, tattoos?

Don't laugh; Alter's girls made a pact that coach Chris Hart would get a belly
piercing should the Knights defeat Carroll in Friday's D-II regional basketball
final. Guess what team will join Hart for some body work?

"Unbelievable," said Alter's Courtney Chihil.

Alter put the defensive clamp on Carroll, winning 49-37 at Vandalia. Next for
the Knights (23-3) is a D-II state semifinal against Columbus Mifflin on
Thursday, March 6, at OSU's Schottenstein Center.

A 'state'-ment

* No one does it better than Stebbins' boys, winners of the state team bowling
title at Lancaster.

* Northmont was ninth in the girls state gymnastics team meet at Hilliard Darby.

* Graham (D-II) has secured another team title, and Troy Christian (D-III) has a
huge lead as the state wrestling tourney wraps up today at OSU.

Alter, Winters shake off Week 10 loss to advance;
Senior running back gains 143 of Alter's 335 yards to help the Knights top
previously unbeaten NCH.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

CINCINNATI - Justin Winters stood outside the Alter High School football locker
room in a T-shirt, but the senior running back was still hot in the bitter cold.

Kind of like he and his teammates felt about Week 10. And kind of like he ran in
the first half.

Helping the Knights shake off a regular season-ending loss to Chaminade
Julienne, Winters rushed for 137 yards and three touchdowns in the first half as
Alter topped host North College Hill 35-14 on Friday in their Division IV,
Region 16 quarterfinal.

It was the 11th straight playoff win for Alter (9-2), the two-time defending
state champion, and the first loss of the season for North College Hill.

It was also the kind of statement Winters and his fellow seniors wanted to make
following their first Greater Catholic League loss in 36 games.

"All of us were upset," Winters said. "We had to show we could play better, and
we didn't want this to be our last game."

Instead, sixth-seeded Alter will play No. 2 Jonathan Alder (10-1) at 7:30 p.m.
Friday at a neutral site to be determined. The Knights beat Jonathan Alder 42-0
in last year's postseason opener.

Despite being denied a home game because of the defeat against CJ, Alter started
fast, scoring on a Winters 10-yard run on the opening drive. North College Hill
used a 47-yard pass by senior quarterback Dakota Dartis, who passed for more
than 2,600 yards this season, to set up a score that cut Alter's lead to 7-6
with 1:31 left in the first quarter.

Alter then used consecutive Winters scores of 46 yards and 1 yard to go up 20-6
with 6:53 left in the second quarter and stayed ahead with its clock-depleting
rushing offense that gained 335 yards. Winters finished with 143 yards on 20
carries.

Dartis passed for 121 yards on 11-of-22 completions with an interception, but
Alter held the ball for the final 9:34 of the game to avert any comeback attempt
by the high-powered NCH offense that averaged 41.9 points per game in winning
the Miami Valley Conference.

"We have to keep improving," said Alter coach Ed Domsitz. "You can't just reach
the playoffs and play at the same level because everybody else is picking it
up."

Winters certainly played better. It helped that he didn't have to put in time on
defense, which he sometimes did throughout the season.

"I feel like I could play another game," he said.

Scrap yard hearing delayed again;

BYLINE: MATT OLBERDING

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 322 words


A public hearing on the proposed move of a scrap processing operation from near
downtown Lincoln to a spot on West O Street is being delayed again.

Alter Trading Corp. requested a two-week delay,pushing Wednesday's scheduled
hearing to June 15.

Alter previously had requested a four-week delay so it could try to allay
concerns of neighbors.

Robert Ellis, vice president and general counsel for Alter Trading Corp., said
the company continues to try to work with neighbors and businesses in the area
to come up with a plan that's acceptable.

Alter, with city support,is looking at moving its scrap processing plant from
525 N St. to 545 W. O St., the site of the former Lincoln Steel plant.

Alter's current location is being indirectly affected by work on the city's new
West Haymarket arena. As part of railroad track relocation to accommodate arena
construction, a rail spur that serves Alter is going away.

The proposed new site has been mostly vacant for the past eight years, but it
sits along one of the main entrances to the city, an entrance which the city has
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to spruce up over the past few years.

Even though the city is supporting the move, many people in the area are not.

As of Tuesday, the city-county Planning Department had received nearly two dozen
letters in opposition to the move.

Ellis said the level of opposition is "one of the reasons we're continuing to
look at other options."

He said that during a meeting between Alter officials and members of the West O
Business Association, the company was presented with some alternative locations
that it had not considered.

Whether any of those options is viable is yet to be determined.

Dan Marvin, the city's arena coordinator, said that to give Alter more time to
finalize its plans, the city has agreed to move back by a month - from July 1 to
Aug. 1 - the date on which it is able to exercise eminent domain on Alter's
current property.

NECESSARY ANGELS
Tradition and Modernity
in Kafka, Benjamin, and Scholem.
By Robert Alter.
Harvard University
with Hebrew Union College, $19.95.

In an impassioned correspondence that ended only with Walter Benjamin's suicide
in 1940 to avoid capture by the Nazis, the critic and Gershom Scholem devoted
much energy and argument to discussions of the allegorical writings of Franz
Kafka. As Robert Alter notes, to Scholem, the Zionist scholar of Jewish
mysticism, Kafka was the last great Jewish mystic, a "heretical kabbalist" in
whose writing "the light of revelation burned . . . unmercifully," even if what
was revealed was devoid of meaning. In Benjamin's view, Kafka was the ultimate
dramatist of alienation, one who sought "on the nether side of nothingness . . .
to feel his way toward redemption." It is notable that Scholem was enough of a
modernist -- or cabalist -- to accept the possibility of revelation without
traditional meaning, while Benjamin, the metaphysician turned Marxist cultural
critic, could still use words like "redemption." It is equally notable that
Kafka explicitly regarded his own writing as an attempt, as Mr. Alter says in
"Necessary Angels," "to create a new sacred scripture." Without ever minimizing
the vast differences in the three writers' work, Mr. Alter, a professor of
Hebrew and comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley, has
brilliantly illuminated the "elaborate network of images, concepts, and
imaginative processes that drew them together." In this deeply learned
meditation on their uses of language, exegesis, memory and revelation, Mr. Alter
maps their complex relationship to the bourgeois German culture in which they
were raised as assimilated Jews and to the spiritual mysteries of Judaism, which
none of them could wholly believe in but which fascinated -- or haunted -- them
all.

Illness was writer's defining moment

BYLINE: Jocelyn McClurg

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 4D

LENGTH: 332 words


NEW YORK -- It's not easy getting Jonathan Alter to talk about himself and his
illness.

But it probably isn't a stretch to say that the publication of his new book
about Franklin Delano Roosevelt represents a triumph of hope for the longtime
Newsweek columnist.

Alter's book, The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope
(Simon & Schuster, $29.95), arrives two years after Alter was diagnosed with
lymphoma.

After chemotherapy, surgery and a bone-marrow transplant, Alter, 48, is in
remission. Aside from a cold and a sore throat that has him ordering soup for
lunch at a Midtown restaurant on a spring day, he's in good health.

"Right after I got sick, I thought of the book as an albatross," says Alter, who
was well into researching and writing when he was diagnosed in 2004. "But I came
to view it as another form of treatment. The illness and the sense that life is
short helped me focus."

FDR himself became an inspiration. Alter sees the way Roosevelt dealt with polio
as his defining personal moment, one that led to a sense of optimism and
self-confidence. And that in turn led to his defining political moment, in the
early days of his presidency, as he rallied a hopeless nation mired in the
depths of the Depression.

Polio "deepened Roosevelt's empathy," Alter says, and his establishment of a
clinic at Warm Springs, Ga., became a "dress rehearsal" for his presidency.

It's no surprise that Alter, who calls himself an "unpredictable liberal," is a
fan of FDR. Roosevelt had a flexibility and ability to compromise that the
current occupant of the White House lacks, he says.

Alter's fascination with presidents and politics goes back to his boyhood in
Chicago. His favorite president was and still is Lincoln. "My mother used to
bake a cake for me every year on Feb. 12," he says.

He grew up to interview many presidents, but "journalism really is a rough
draft," Alter says. He hopes his book will be read "100 years from now. I wanted
to do something that would last."

$200,000 project is scheduled to be finished by Aug. 18, when school starts.

KETTERING - Alter High School has been busy this summer working on its three
R's: renovating, refurbishing and re-routing.

The Catholic school's $200,000 project - which is part of a long-range
facilities plan - involves the gymnasium, athletic equipment room, Spirit Shop
and the building's stairwells.

The project was paid for by money raised through the school's Capital Campaign,
which is an ongoing fund for donations to Alter, and a contribution from the
booster club.

"It is more restoration than it is construction," said Jeff Plate, director of
institutional advancement at Alter, who added that the project started in May,
just before graduation. It is scheduled to be done by Aug. 18 - "because that's
when school starts."

The gym is being pressure-washed and painted, ceiling fans are being installed,
and the floor is being stripped and refinished.

"It will include the current logo that Alter has come to be known by," Plate
said. "It will be a more appealing place to watch games."

Also, the Spirit Shop will exchange places with an athletic equipment room. The
Spirit Shop will be inside the main door of the gym entrance to the school.

"This will make the Spirit Shop more accessible for parents and students," Plate
said. "And, by adding a ticket booth as part of the Spirit Shop, it streamlines
ticket sales for home events, thereby reducing traffic entering and exiting the
gym."

Finally, the stairwells at the school are being repainted and are getting new
skids.

The last renovation of this scale happened in 1980s, according to Plate, when
the gym floor was stripped, sanded and refinished.

To keep people abreast of the renovations at Alter, the school has been posting
construction updates on its website (www.alterhighsc hool.org) throughout the
summer.

"The community is interested in what we're doing," Plate said. "We try to keep
that fresh for everybody. We also get a lot of looks during the summer from
prospective parents."

Alter, a private Catholic high school at 940 E. David Road in Kettering, was
founded in 1962.

The school is expecting an enrollment of 659 for the 2010-11 school year, which
Plate said is "holding steady."

Alter draws students from Kettering, Bellbrook, Centerville, Springboro,
Miamisburg and the Greater Dayton area.

Tuition costs $5,750 to $8,095, depending on family income and whether families
are members of St. Charles Borromeo Parish.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL WEEK 1 PREVIEW

LENGTH: 717 words


Alter High's Ed Domsitz has been a head football coach for 39 years and enjoys
building programs and working with kids. There are at least 17 new coaches in
area football this season. STAFF FILE

Alter High School head football coach Ed Domsitz has a message for wannabe
coaches: Come join in the fun.

Domsitz has been a head coach for 39 seasons, or, as he said, "Gerald Ford was
president when I got to be a head coach."

In that time he's built Alter into a state small-school power. He's also seen
the game change and it has nothing to do with the spread off ense.

At least 17 new area head coaches will be in place from last season. That's a
continuing trend that has hit high school sports programs hard, including boys
and girls basketball.

"The enjoyment you get from putting together an entire program on the high
school level where it deals with the student body, the parents, the
administration, the teachers and the kids, there's a lot of satisfaction to be
found in that," Domsitz said.

"I would encourage young people to get into that. We're losing a lot of good
coaches. The baby boomers, a lot of them are retiring. We're going to need some
good men to fi ll those spots over the next few years."

Like most area teams, Alter begins its season today in what's become an annual
visit to its "home" fi eld, Roush Stadium, to play rival Fairmont. But Alter
also has "home" games at Centerville, Springboro and Welcome Stadium.

Here's a few other things to know about this high school football season:

Crosstown Showdown: Several area teams will play in four Skyline Chili Crosstown
Showdown games to open their seasons. The 16th annual event will feature
southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky teams in 25 games and began last week in
Kentucky.

Thurgood Marshall and new coach Robert Brown will meet Middletown at 7 p.m.
today at Welcome Stadium. Three more games with area teams will be played
Saturday: Fenwick vs. Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy at Kings, Franklin vs.
Carlisle at Monroe and Stebbins at West Carrollton. The Saturday games are at 7
p.m.

Blitz alert: Flyin' to the Hoop creator Eric Horstman couldn't help himself and
will debut the Premier Health Backyard Blitz at Centerville on Saturday.

There will be two games: Pickerington Central will play Goose Creek (S.C.) at 4
p.m., followed by Centerville vs. Glenbard North (Ill.) at 8. It'll also mark
the debut of new Centerville coach Rodney Roberts, who left Franklin to succeed
Ron Ullery.

Flyin' is among the nation's best midseason boys basketball tournaments.
Horstman said the Blitz won't grow to Crosstown Showdown size but likely will
expand and stay at one location. Centerville is committed to host again next
season.

Making their points: The computer point system designed by Jack Harbin remains
in place in determining which teams advance to the postseason.

The system has been tweaked by the Ohio High School Athletic Association over
the years to account for ties and out-of-state opponents. What hasn't changed is
the first- and second-level points.

Teams are awarded the maximum first-level points for winning a game.
Second-level points are based on wins by a beaten opponent.

This is the second year for an expanded seven divisions. D-I is made up of two
regions and 16 teams in each qualify for the playoffs. There are four regions in
Divisions II-VII and the top eight teams in each advance.

Championship weekend: It still takes five weeks/games to win a state title. What
has changed is the location. All the title games have moved from Massillon and
Canton in Stark County to Ohio Stadium in Columbus on Dec. 4-6.

One of the divisions that has its playoff games anchored on Fridays will be
moved to Thursday, Dec. 4. There will be state-title tripleheaders on Friday and
Saturday.

Reporting results: Contact Cox Media Group Ohio with information as soon as
possible by email only after all varsity high school athletic contests,
including football. A results form for all sports has been sent to each school's
athletic director and forwarded to coaches and program statisticians.

                                 The Bond Buyer

Trends in the Region: States Begin to Back School Districts' Credit to Lift
Ratings

                             March 22, 1996, Friday

By Antonio A. Prado



Banking on their high credit ratings, Utah and Wyoming - like a growing number
of states - are looking to offer their local school districts credit enhancement
in hopes of garnering top ratings without the need for bond insurance.

These types of bond guarantee programs - currently operating in 17 states -
strengthen a local issuer's credit quality, and in some cases function as
complete credit substitutions to bondholders.

Wyoming's program received high marks recently from the top-three credit rating
agencies, earning triple-A's across the board.

Utah's guarantee program, approved late last month by state lawmakers, is
expected to receive the same ratings if ratified by voters in the November
statewide election.

Of the 14 states that offer enhancements only to school districts, seven
programs are rated in the A range, five are in the double-A range, and one - the
Texas Permanent School Fund guarantee - is triple-A rated.

California is the only other Far West state with a local bond credit enhancement
program. However, only certain eligible city and county bonds and leases are
backed by the A-rated program, which is funded by a portion of motor vehicle
license fees collected.

Wyoming's program is funded indirectly with mineral mining royalties, which go
into the state's Permanent Land Trust Fund. The Common School Account that backs
Wyoming's school district bonds is part of the land trust.

Utah's proposed School Bond Default Avoidance Program puts the full faith and
credit of the state behind eligible local school issues.

"That was really important," Utah Treasurer Edward Alter said of the program's
recent passage in the state Legislature. "We have every reason to think it will
be successful."

Alter said only an unusual circumstance could stand in the way of the program's
ratification by voters this fall.

"You'll sort of have a double-GO, if you will," said D. Kent Michie, vice
president with Zion's Bank Public Finance in Salt Lake City, describing Utah's
guarantee program proposal. "To my knowledge we are the first state that will
consider and actually put its full faith and credit behind these bonds.

"That's a first, and hopefully the rating agencies will see that for the
creditworthiness that it is," added Michie, who helped craft the program with
Alter and the state school superintendent's office. "We're really in gear."

Michie estimates the program, if ratified, will provide $50 million to $70
million in present-value savings over a 20-year-period for Utah's local school
districts.

Alter said that in addition to the local school district program, the state is
also considering a program for enhancing university bonds. "The next one that
we're looking at is some other way to issue bonds for our institutions of higher
education, which are normally issued through our Board of Regents, to enhance
their credit ratings, and subsequently get lower interest," Alter added.

That program will probably be unveiled next January at the start of Utah's 1997
legislative session, officials said.

Alter suggested some form of lending program with a state moral obligation
pledge, where Utah's public universities would continue to issue their own
bonds. He predicted that kind of program would probably secure double-A ratings
for the state's higher-education debt issuance.

"If the state could issue (universities') bonds, they could do better," Alter
said.

The first bonds to be guaranteed under Wyoming's School District Bond Guarantee
Program are expected to be approved by the State Land and Farm Loan Board by
next month.

That state's program, created in March 1994, backs local school debt with $100
million set aside from Wyoming's Common School Account. The program limits
guarantees to $300 million of local district issues.

Moody's Investors Service took the lead on Feb. 9 in rating the program Aaa.
Standard & Poor's Corp. followed March 11 in giving it its top rating, and a day
later Fitch Investors Service did the same.

"School districts display low loss ratios relative to other types of municipal
issuers, indicating that the level of reserves required by the Wyoming program
is extremely strong," said David Hitchcock, a director with Standard & Poor's in
New York.

At the start of this year, outstanding Wyoming school district debt totaled
about $186 million, according to a recent CreditWeek Municipal report by
Hitchcock about that state's program. Like most other programs of its kind, only
investment-grade general obligation bonds are eligible for Wyoming's state
guarantee.

Alter lands another 10-0 regular season;
Defending state champs clinch GCL North title by shutting out rival Chaminade
Julienne 21-0.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

CLAYTON - Since the early season, Alter High School's Cody Taulbee has worn the
same shirt under his uniform.

It's black, and in capital purple letters it reads, "Winner." His grandmother
gave it to him after she won it in a slot tournament at the Riviera Hotel in Las
Vegas.

"I thought it was appropriate after Week 1, since it says 'Winner' on it,"
Taulbee said. "I just cut it out and wore it under my jersey."

So far, the superstition was worked. Alter, in completing its third undefeated
season in the past four, topped Chaminade Julienne 21-0 on Friday, Oct. 30, at
Northmont in a game between state-ranked teams.

The victory secured Alter (10-0), which had already cinched its playoff spot, a
Greater Catholic League North Division title and a regular season-ending No. 1
ranking in the Associated Press state Division IV poll. It also sent the Knights
into the first round with confidence. The Knights won all of their games by at
least 15 points.

"I've told people that this is a team trying to establish its own identity,"
Alter coach Ed Domsitz said. "They didn't want to be the team that followed 'The
Team.' "

In their last regular season game to prove it, Alter went ahead early. Taulbee
scored from 27 yards on an option pitch on the first possession to give the
Knights a 7-0 lead with 6:49 left in the first quarter. CJ (8-2), which entered
ranked No. 6 in the state in D-III, struggled on fourth down, as the Eagles were
stopped on consecutive series from the Alter 22 and 41 yard lines before the
Knights used a Justin Winters 1-yard scoring to run to go ahead 14-0 with 5:56
left in the first half.

Alter finished its scoring with a 18-yard scoring strike from quarterback Zane
Pitzer to Connor Cummins with 10:32 left.

The win gave Alter its 41st consecutive regular season victory on the field (it
forfeited its first two victories of 2008) and its eighth consecutive season
with at least eight wins.

"Our guys played hard," said CJ coach Andy Helms. "But it's like we told them,
there's a difference between playing hard and executing."

SHREDDER OPERATOR SUES ST. PAUL

BYLINE: BYLINE: ANN BAKER, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: METRO; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 230 words


The Iowa company that wants to build a high-tech metal shredder on St. Paul's
West Side riverfront is suing the city of St. Paul for $20 million.

Alter Trading Corp. claims the city violated the firm's constitutional rights,
forcing it to lose business through a string of unfair delays over a permit for
the proposed shredder.

The company also accuses the city of targeting Alter alone by the city's
yearlong moratorium on metal shredders the City Council adopted on Aug. 7.

"We believe it was lawfully enacted," City Attorney Tim Marx said Thursday. "The
city is trying to look at land-use issues and environmental issues with this new
technology and to resolve them. To do it in a litigious environment will not be
helpful."

Alter filed the complaint Tuesday in U.S. District Court in St. Paul.

The company claims the city aimed its moratorium "solely and exclusively" at
Alter's proposal, the only one that was pending. The complaint quotes unnamed
City Council members calling the measure "the Alter moratorium."

The complaint further argues that Minnesota law requires a city to approve or
deny a permit request in 60 days and that Alter's permit application - submitted
July 1, 1995 - still hasn't been acted upon.

Alter claims the city violated its rights to just compensation for taking of
property, due process and equal protection of the law.

Skeeter named MVP of international tournament

LENGTH: 557 words


Last summer, Lamar Skeeter showcased his ability to soar when his select
basketball team from Ohio traveled to Italy.

This summer, the celebrated Kettering Fairmont High School graduate displayed
his overall game during a return trip abroad.

Skeeter's electrifying win in a slam dunk contest last summer brought the
Italian fans out of the stands.

This time around, Skeeter earned most valuable player honors after leading Team
Ohio to the Bari International 19-and-under tournament in Italy.

The lightning-quick guard averaged 23 points as his squad went 6-0, capped off
by an 89-61 win in the finals over a team from Russia.

"The dunk contest last year was unbelievable," he said. "That was a different
atmosphere. The MVP award shows more than jumping high. But both were great
experiences."

Skeeter soaked in more culture last year with sightseeing in Venice and Milan.
Bari, located along the coast, offered a beautiful beach, but not as many places
to visit.

Last year's tournament was also more of a learning experience on the court.
After playing against a rougher style of European ball last time, he came better
prepared on his return visit.

Skeeter used his quickness and court awareness to overcome the more physical
players.

Those traits will be on display in the coming months when Skeeter plays soccer
and basketball at Walsh University in Canton.

Fairmont's career scoring leader in both sports started soccer training at Walsh
last week.

State successes at Alter

Alter High School senior Kathleen Glavin became the Knights' first female golfer
to reach the state tournament. But she's not the only individual with the
program to boast of state credentials.

Alter girls golf coach Doug Orange has coached the Brookville softball team to
the state semifinals the past two seasons.

In his first season at Brookville in 2006, he led the Blue Devils to their first
state appearance since 1985. This year his team made a return trip before
falling to Bloom-Carroll, 6-1, in the semifinals to finish 25-6.

Knights face state's best

Alter's girls soccer team didn't wait for the postseason to face some of the
best competition in Ohio.

The Knights teamed up with Middletown Fenwick and Metro FC to stage the Ohio
High School Girls Soccer Challenge at Delco Park in Kettering on Aug. 11.

The preseason event drew 18 teams, including state powers like Dublin Coffman,
the Division I state runner-up last year.

Teams from Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Toledo also came to town.

Fairmont, Centerville, Beavercreek, Carroll, Chaminade-Julienne and Springboro
were the local teams represented.

The one-day event allowed each team three exhibition matches. The level of
talent provided a measuring stick to start the season and offered a showcase to
college coaches.

Alter has stamped itself as one of the state's Division II powers for several
years. Since 1995, the Knights have enjoyed consistent tournament success,
highlighted by two state runner-up finishes and two more appearances in the
state semifinals.

Alter opens the regular season Saturday at home against Bay Village. Another
highlight includes a trip to Memphis for a tournament Sept. 15-16.

Head coach Jason Balogh returns for his seventh season. The Knights finished
13-5-1 last year with their second straight district runner-up finish.

Alter volleyball team digs Laravie's success

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 419 words


The term "digs" in volleyball should really be changed to floor burns. That's
the reward for a player diving, sliding and risking injury to keep the ball
alive.

One of the reasons Alter advanced to the D-II state tournament was Katie
Laravie's floor presence. Every time a ball seemed headed for the floor in the
regional final vs. Cincinnati Roger Bacon last Saturday at Wilmington, Laravie
was there to keep play going.

She had 25 digs "which is huge in a match as big as this," said Alter coach Tina
Jasinowski. "Katie was all over the place. I don't know how many points she kept
alive, but it was a lot."

Alter is looking for its third D-II state title in the last six years. The
tourney begins Thursday at WSU's Nutter Center. Alter plays its semifinal on
Friday. - Dave Long

Winner gets the keg

Clinton-Massie will battle Blanchester Friday in the Division IV regional
football semifinals at Kings. In addition to the playoff stakes, the game will
be for the coveted Cider Keg, the football trophy game. The wooden barrel
represents the fierce football rivalry between the two Clinton County schools.
It is red, white and blue, and the scores of every game from 1964 is painted on
it.

"It's always an intense game and it's for the King of the County," said Massie's
running back Drew Frey. "Both communities get fired up for this game."

Added Falcons quarterback Tyler Sargent: "It's the most intense game I've ever
played in. It has to be one of the oldest small-school rivalries around. We've
haven't played since 2004 because of our new league affiliation so meeting in
the playoffs, Week 12, will be special."

Football forfeits likely for No. 2 Alter;
At issue is a sophomore who transferred from Jefferson High School and played in
the Knights' first two games.

BYLINE: By Sean McClelland Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 326 words


Alter High School used an ineligible player in its first two football games, and
the state's No. 2-ranked Division IV team apparently will forfeit both. "Looks
like it's true," Alter coach Ed Domsitz said Saturday, Sept. 13. The Knights
improved to 4-0 on Friday by beating Cincinnati Roger Bacon, 34-7. Their first
two wins were blowouts of Fairmont (39-7) and Bellbrook (49-14).

At issue is a student who transferred from Jefferson High School. Domsitz, in
his 17th year at Alter, said he's never seen anything like this in 33 years of
coaching.

"It wasn't a matter of age or grades," Domsitz said in a phone interview. "It
was a transfer situation where an individual was not an athlete when he came in
and actually ended up taking his sophomore year again at Alter. This was
something we weren't aware of, we being football.

"We didn't know this young man was going to play sports. I didn't even know him
when he came to school. Then he decided he would (play football). It's not the
fault of any one department."

Domsitz said he found out Friday morning when a guidance counselor met with him
to discuss the student. He and Athletic Director Chris Hart then marched to the
principal's office and "we all came to the same conclusion," the coach said.
"There was no room to maneuver."

A self-reporting letter has been sent by the school to the Ohio High School
Athletic Association, according to Domsitz, who said, "As bad as it feels and as
much as it hurts, you've got to be willing to do the right thing."

Domsitz said he broke the news to the team Saturday and plans to share details
with parents at the team's weekly film session Monday night.

There's a chance the Knights now will need to win the rest of their games to
make the playoffs.

"There's not much room for failure," Domsitz conceded. "If we can go 8-2, then
we'd have a pretty good shot. That's the premise we're working on."

Alter KOs Tipp to reach final four;
GIRLS BASKETBALL

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 459 words


Alter's Maddie Bazelak moves in to defend against Calif Stewart of Tippecanoe.
Alter (28-0) defeated Tipp 64-33 in a Division II regional final at Springfield
High.

SPRINGFIELD - There was a heightened sense of urgency in Alter's practices the
last couple of days. A long-awaited showdown with Tippecanoe in a battle of
unbeaten girls basketball teams will do that.

"We were all really pumped and really wanted this game," Alter sophomore Braxtin
Miller said after the Knights landed a devastating 64-33 knockout of the Red
Devils in a girls high school basketball Division II regional final before a
capacity crowd at Springfield High School on Friday night.

"We just wanted to come out and prove that we could do it."

The win launches Alter (28-0) into the D-II state final four for the second
straight season. The Knights will play defending state champ Millersburg West
Holmes (24-3) in a rematch at 1 p.m. Friday at Ohio State University's
Schottenstein Center.

West Holmes beat Alter in another unbeaten showdown in last year's state title
game. Holmes advanced by beating Zanesville Maysville 42-34 also on Friday.

Alter and Tipp had an eye on each other as the season progressed. Sure enough,
each went through the regular season unscathed. Alter won its first state poll
and Tipp was No. 2.

"Our kids were really focused and they've been focused the last two days in
practice," Knights coach Chris Hart said. "We really believe in how we practice
carries over. That really showed."

Alter made a game-opening 13-zip statement and hiked its game up from there. The
lead was 21 points by halftime and 55-24 after three quarters.

Ironically, Alter also beat another unbeaten Tipp team in their previous 2009
contest also in a regional final, 45-43.

Miller scored a season-high 21 points and spent half her time shutting down Tipp
senior sensation Halee Printz (9 points). Emma Bockrath added 15 points for the
Knights and Libby Bazelak 11.

Maddie Bazelak's swat of Printz's first shot set a physical tone that Alter
carried throughout the mismatch.

"Obviously, we weren't prepared for that," said Printz, who'll take her game to
the University of Toledo next season. "It was a crazy game, but it was fun
getting here. It was well worth it. It was a heck of a season."

Stronger, faster and a step ahead throughout, Alter made certain Tipp couldn't
mount a rally.

"It can happen," Tipp co-coach Jason Hadden said. "In a game like this everybody
is jacked up. What happens is whatever the first three minutes are can dictate
it. That's what happened."

Alter is on an unprecedented 57-1 run over the last two seasons. It'll also be
the sixth time the Knights have been to the final four, all since 2002. Alter
won the 2008 D-II state title and was runner-up in '14 and '10.

Knights defeat C-J at Cage Classic;
Alter rallies late with 11 unanswered points

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi mgokavi@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 540 words


DAYTON - Alter's girls basketball team ended more than a dozen year's worth of
frustration in five minutes.

The Knights scored the game's last 11 points in a 38-33 win over
Chaminade-Julienne on Saturday at UD Arena. "We were so determined to come in
here and win tonight because we could," Alter senior Caitlyn Mauch said. "For a
change."

With the win during the 17th annual Cage Classic, Alter improves to 16-2 while
C-J falls to 9-9.

Alter coach Chris Hart didn't know the last time the Knights defeated the
Eagles. "I couldn't tell you, not since I've been at Alter," she said. "At least
12 (years).

"It means a whole lot to us. We've had some really good games in the last five
years, some competitive games, but we couldn't get over the top. We got over the
top tonight."

C-J led 18-17 at halftime behind Tiera Stephen, who had a teamhigh nine points.
The Eagles then took 25-17 and 33-27 leads. Each time, the Knights rallied by
attacking the basket. "We always keep our composure," Alter sophomore Meghan
Waterman said. "We do that well."

Courney Chihil (13 points), Mauch (10) and Waterman (7) led the charge.
Waterman's driving layup with one minute left put Alter up 35-33.

From there, the Knights put the clamps on C-J, forcing many of the Eagles' 25
turnovers. C-J didn't score in the last five minutes and made zero field goals
in the last seven. "We play hard, we're just still learning how to play smart
and get it done down the stretch," C-J coach Marc Greenberg said. "I think in
this case, Alter was just better tonight."

* Alter boys 45, C-J 43: C-J started slow and finished fast in the Cage
Classic's exciting nightcap. But when Steve Dees' shot in traffic from the right
block fell off the rim at the buzzer, Alter held on.

The Knights led 10-0 and never trailed as Danny Bruner (15 points) and Chris
Kohls (14) hit big shots when needed. CJ missed free throws (12 of 18) and made
key turnovers that hampered its comeback.

Dees (13 points), Alex Johnson (9) and Brian Scott (8) nearly did the trick.
When Bruner missed two free throws (Alter was 5 of 13) with nine ticks left, C-J
worked the ball from Scott to Dees, whose bank shot just rolled out.

C-J won the first matchup, 56-47 on Jan. 3. Alter improves to 9-8 and 6-5 in the
GCL North, while C-J falls to 12-4 and 8-3.

* Carroll boys 49, Fenwick 41: Craig Elam led three Patriots in double digits
with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Kevin Vest (15 points) and Josh King (12) helped
Carroll gain the eightpoint lead it took after one quarter. Joe Murphy (20
points) and Bill Rost (11) led the Falcons.

* Carroll girls 42, Fenwick 34: Brogan Berry did a little bit of everything.
Berry had 14 points, four steals and three assists. She also hit 8 of 11 free
throws. The Patriots hit 15 of 20 while Fenwick made 2 of 5. Marianne Mc-Goron
led the Falcons with nine points.

* Lehman Catholic boys 83, Springfield Catholic 36: Lehman outscored SCC 40-10
in the middle two quarters. Kyle Corbin led the Cavaliers with 20.

* Lehman Catholic girls 58, Springfield Catholic 42: Despite being outrebounded
44-26, the Cavaliers blew open a close game with a 23-8 second quarter. Sarah

Freytag scored 19 and Jessica Slagle had 14 for Lehman. For SCC, Leslie Purnell
had 14 points and 21 rebounds.

Alter's Borland headed to 'dream school' Wisconsin

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 396 words


KETTERING - It took Chris Borland less than an hour to make his decision to play
college football at the University of Wisconsin.

"I knew in my heart it was the place I wanted to play," said the Alter High
School senior-to-be. "But I wanted to call my dad (Jeff Borland) and make sure
he agreed with it. He was happy with my decision."

Borland, a 6-foot, 215-pounder, gave a verbal commitment to play for the Badgers
on Tuesday, June 24. Wisconsin coach Bret Bielema made a scholarship offer to
him at the end of a twoday camp he was attending in Madison, Wis. A quick phone
call and it was a done deal.

He will be the third area player on the Wisconsin roster. Shane Carter is a
junior defensive back and Jake Current a freshman center. Both attended Troy
High School.

A running back at Alter, Borland is projected as an outside linebacker at
Wisconsin even though he has never played the position in high school.

"The only time I've played it is the different camps I've been this spring,"
Borland said. "I've put in time working on the pass drops and all the things a
linebacker does.

"I'm still working hard on the footwork and the covering and reads and stuff. I
think it will all come together this high school season."

Borland had attended camps at Miami University, Indiana and Purdue. He also had
interest from Illinois, Iowa, Virginia and Louisville. Wisconsin was his first
scholarship offer.

"I could have waited, but Wisconsin is my dream school," he said. "My
grandfather graduated from Wisconsin. My dad lived there until his family moved
when he was a teenager and we still have a lot of family in the state.

"They only have 16 scholarships to give this year. So I figured when they
offered I should grab it before they offered it to someone else."

Borland, fifth in the Division II state shot put, ran for 633 yards and nine
touchdowns last season. He also punted and caught 10 passes for 124 yards and a
TD for the 11-1 Knights.

"Coach Bielema thought I could be an H-Back or fullback," said Borland, who runs
the 40-yard dash in 4.65 seconds. "I could also be a punter. I'll do whatever it
takes to get on the field.

"I'm happy to have the decision out of the way. I've been at camps the last week
and I would have been at Illinois today (Thursday, June 26) if I hadn't
committed.

"Now I can relax for a while before I start lifting again and getting ready for
the season."

The 1977 Alter graduate won state titles with his brother in their junior and
senior seasons.

Kohls continued his career at the college level. He played two years with the
University of South Carolina at Sumter at first doubles and third singles.

He then played two years at Ohio State University, where he earned a degree in
marketing.

Kohls started a sales career with Reynolds & Reynolds and, since 1994, at the
Minnesota Automobile Dealers Association, where he is director of services.

1980.

He played singles and doubles at Ohio State, where he was a premed student and
earned Big Ten Scholar Athlete honors.

Jeff's life was cut tragically short by his battle with cancer in 1983.

The Kettering Tennis Center held a Jeff Kohls Memorial Tennis Tournament for
several years to benefit cancer research.

Bob Vari

Vari, a member of Alter's first graduating class in 1966, was a football and
basketball standout for the Knights.

In his senior year, the wide receiver helped Alter lead area rankings and land a
spot in the state rankings. He was named to the All-Area first team by the
Dayton Daily News and The Journal Herald.

Vari earned full athletic scholarship to the University of Louisville, where he
played four years of football and one year of basketball.

Alter making 3rd straight trip to Schottenstein Center

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 288 words


KETTERING - Two seasons ago, when the Alter High School girls basketball team
won the program's first Division II state championship, then-sophomore Ashley
Christie scored a game-high 20 points in the title game.

Ali Mygrants, Kaila Howe, Courtney Christie and Whitney Dabbelt - the other four
starters on this season's Alter team - played a combined 48 minutes.

As the Knights (23-2) enter their third straight state tournament with a DII
semifinal against Washington Court House Miami Trace (24-1) at 8 p.m. Thursday,
March 18, they claim at least one major advantage: sheer game time in the
Schottenstein Center.

Miami Trace is making its first trip to Columbus, while Alter's starters boast a
combined 227 minutes of game time inside Value City Arena.

"This year we obviously had an experienced team returning," said Alter coach
Chris Hart. "We had eight letter winners back from a state semifinal team, and
that's a huge benefit."

Miami Trace grieving

On Wednesday, March 10, two days before Miami Trace was scheduled to play its
regional final, the team learned the father of players Juliane and Deidre McKay
died after an extended illness.

"He was diagnosed a few years ago, and the girls were aware of it, they knew it
was a possibility it could happen during the year," said coach James Stutzman.
"When we got the call and talked to the girls the next day at practice, it was
very sobering."

Miami Trace played Friday night and topped Minerva in the regional final.

"Both daughters were adamant that they knew their father would want them to
remain part of the team," Stutzman said. "They both played substantial minutes,
and they were a big part of our victory."

When the Vision 2025 arena bids threatened a 33-percent budget overrun, project
manager Matrix sent its staff into several days of detailed cost and analysis
with Tulsa Vision Builders and city leaders.

After determining a plan to trim $15 million from the iconic structure, Mayor
Kathy Taylor then asked for a guarantee against future bid overruns.

"To my knowledge, no one's ever asked anyone in my industry to do that before,"
Matrix founder and president Steve Alter said, his eyes still reflecting
surprise at the April 2006 request. "It's not like we had a crystal ball. "

Having already donated $3.5 million in fees to cut arena costs, and hundreds of
hours of staff time to iron out the problems, Matrix agreed to give up $500,000
if any other bids disrupted the work flow. But with 97 percent of the work
awarded, the Matrix guarantee appears to have held up. With the arena $1 million
under contract, founding principal Kelli Bailey expects the remaining bids over
the next two months to close successfully.

That will allow the Tulsa architectural, engineering and planning firm to enter
a broad expansion plan that Alter hopes will double its revenue over the next
three years.

"That's what we were meeting about just this morning," Bailey said with a smile.

Even with renovation planning well under way for transforming the Tulsa
Convention Center into Oklahoma's largest ballroom, Alter said the two key
Vision 2025 projects make up a small part of Matrix output.

With a staff of more than 65 at three Tulsa locations, Alter said Matrix has
drawn more than $500 million in ongoing contracts with several key Tulsa
employers, from helping city leaders evaluate One Williams Center as a possible
place to relocate City Hall, to developing master plans to expand both Tulsa
Community College and the Tulsa Technical Center.

Matrix also has attracted ongoing projects with American Electric Power, Saint
Simeon's Episcopal Home, and Trinity Episcopal Church, as well as developing a
boutique hotel in Las Vegas.

With the economy supporting a vibrant commercial construction and renovation
market, Matrix intends to use its momentum to open offices in Oklahoma City and
northwest Arkansas by 2010. While existing relationships will drive these moves,
Alter expects new business to generate 80 percent of revenue in these offices.

Health care represents one targeted area, said Bailey, who expects Matrix to tap
its full-service capabilities to win contracts in the small clinic and specialty
hospital markets, as it has in Tulsa and Moore.

Alter sees further growth through expanding alliance relationships with other
regional or national firms, as Matrix used in its arena bid with Cesar Pelli &
Associates and Odell Associates Inc.

"We have five ongoing projects like that right now," he said, expecting to
participate in "half a dozen more. "

But even as such projects carry the 23-year-old firm into regional and national
projects - one once led Matrix into Siberia - Alter expects 90 percent of the
firm's work will remain in Oklahoma.

With its diversified client base and the Sooner State economy purring along,
fueled by strong oil prices and increasing immigration of coastal citizens and
wealth, Alter and Bailey expect Matrix to enjoy a 30-percent revenue boost this
year, coming on top of the 25-percent growth enjoyed last year despite the arena
hiccup. The two graduates of Kansas State University see only one large hurdle
in their way - finding enough quality people to hire.

"We have shortages all across the board," said Alter, noting the company had at
least six positions unfilled and more anticipated.

"We'll take just about anybody," added Bailey, although the company prefers
experienced workers. "Right now we'll take just about anybody that comes in the
door. "

Baltimore Jewish Times publisher wins appellate round

BYLINE: Ben Mook

LENGTH: 384  words


An appeals court has turned aside an attempt by printing company H.G. Roebuck &
Son Inc. to increase the damage award it won a suit against the publisher of the
Baltimore Jewish Times.

The Maryland Court of Special Appeals affirmed that Andrew Alter Buerger, CEO of
Alter Communications Inc., was not liable for lost profits to Roebuck based on a
noncompete clause in their contract.

Baltimore-based Roebuck had sued Alter and Buerger after Alter switched printers
in 2009. The lawsuit, filed in Baltimore County Circuit Court, sought payments
for back invoices as well as additional damages for lost profits from Buerger
and another officer, who has since sold her holdings in Alter.

The lower court awarded Roebuck $362,125 for the unpaid invoices plus
pre-judgment interest. However, the court granted summary judgment in favor of
Buerger as to lost damages, ruling that he was not responsible for the
additional damages. Roebuck appealed the decision and, on Tuesday, the Court of
Special Appeals affirmed that ruling.

According Roebuck's complaint, the contract stipulated that Roebuck was to be
the sole printer for Alter's products. It included a clause that prevented
Buerger and others from owning an interest in, or working for, other Jewish
newspapers in Baltimore City and five counties for a three-year period if they
switched printers.

Roebuck claimed that Buerger violated the agreement by remaining an officer at
Alter once Roebuck ceased being its exclusive printer. The appellate court said
Roebuck could only seek injunctive relief for violating the noncompete
agreement, not monetary damages.

"There is no language...that makes Buerger liable for damages in the form of
lost profits caused by Alter's breach of the Agreement," Judge Patrick L.
Woodward wrote for the appellate court.

Alter filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy on April 14, 2010, after
Roebuck was awarded the damages.

After several lengthy attempts to reach a mutually agreed-upon plan proved
unsuccessful, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge on March 16 ordered the appointment
of a trustee to auction off the 93-year old company's assets.

The auction of the assets, primarily the Jewish Times and related publications,
originally was scheduled for Thursday, but was postponed by agreement of the
parties until next Monday.

EX-OPPONENTS RUN IN DIFFERENT RACES ... REDISTRICTING WILL OFFER NEW; CHALLENGES

BYLINE: Shari L. Gaddy Post-Dispatch Special Correspondent

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 518 words


State Rep. JoAnn Karll, D-High Ridge, and Bill Alter, the Republican she
narrowly defeated two years ago, are running for the House next year, but not
against each other.  As a result of redistricting, neither will seek election in
the 104th district in northern Jefferson County, which Karll now represents.
Karll defeated Alter by 44 votes in 1990 to gain the House seat. Alter held the
seat from 1989 to 1991.  A commission has approved new district boundaries for
the state, but the courts are considering challenges to the map.  Karll said she
has moved to High Ridge so she can run in the 105th District in the
commission-approved plan.  Alter's home in High Ridge was placed in the 90th
District. He said last week that he plans to run there.  Karll said the new
105th District will consist of about 30,000 residents of Jefferson County and
4,000 residents of Franklin County residents.  ''I'm planning to run for
re-election. I changed residences to be able to run in the 105th,'' Karll said.
Karll said she grew up in House Springs near Highway MM. The new 105th would
encompass that area.  ''I want to represent as many Jefferson County residents
as possible,'' Karll said.  She said in her re-election campaign that she will
stress her attendance at legislative sessions.  Another important aspect of her
term was the passage of a bill she sponsored to make marital rape a crime.
''I've learned so much about getting legislation passed. I've argued and debated
with colleagues to get the bill passed,'' Karll said.  Karll said ''I'm very
responsive to my constituents. When I can help a resident with problems, I feel
good,'' Karll said.  She has also opened an office in the Murphy Flats. In the
office, she stocks government agency brochures for residents.  ''I believe by
having a district office I'm returning a portion of residents' tax dollars to
them,'' Karll said.  Karll said she likes to keep involved in the community. She
is currently serving on the board of directors for the Northwest Jefferson
County Chamber of Commerce and the Mideast Agency on Aging. She recently
graduated from the St. Louis University Law School.  Alter noted that 63 percent
of the residents of the new 90th district would be Jefferson County residents,
with the remainder from St. Louis County.  Alter said he is strong on economic
development and the growth of small businesses. He helped form the new northwest
Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce in 1990.  ''I'm opposed to starting new
programs. My agenda would be to cut the cost and size of government,'' Alter
said.  The purpose of government is to create an atmosphere where people have an
opportunity to work, excel and achieve on their own, without government
interference, Alter said.  ''The public tells us that they are opposed to
raising taxes. It's foolish to propose any in these economic times,'' Alter
said.  Alter said he supports the right to life and the right of citizens to
bear arms for their defense.  Alter has also been active in the Jefferson County
Sheriff Reserve for over 10 years. Currently, he is its commander.

Alter stops D-III's leader;
Knights hand Lady Chipps a second consecutive defeat.;
CLASSIC IN THE COUNTRY

BYLINE: By Eric Frantz

SECTION: ; Pg. C4

LENGTH: 369 words


BERLIN - It's unlikely Doylestown Chippewa will be coming to the Miami Valley
anytime soon.

Heading into the Classic in the Country undefeated and ranked No. 1 in Ohio in
Division III, the Lady Chipps suffered their second loss in as many days to a
local team with a 47-39 setback to D-II No. 1 Alter on Sunday during the second
day of the event at Berlin Hiland High School.

Chippewa (13-2) lost to D-I Tecumseh 70-46 on Saturday.

Alter, which beat Columbus Africentric 63-48 on Saturday, improves to 14-2. The
Knights are 72-3 the last three seasons.

Chippewa's previous season low was against Tecumseh. The Lady Chipps were
averaging 62 points per game.

"We wanted the game in the 40s, because we knew (Alter) had trouble in
low-scoring games," Chippewa coach Dennis Shrock said. "I bet they're shocked
that they only scored 47."

Said Alter co-head coach Kendall Peck: "Our defensive focus and intensity was
really good. We set goals on what we wanted to do and we worked hard on the
defensive end."

Ahead 28-24 at half, Alter limited Chippewa to 15 second-half points.

Limiting Chippewa senior Ashley Richardson, the reigning D-III state player of
the year who was averaging 22 points per game, to less than 10 points was one
Alter goal. It was attained. Richardson scored just seven points. She took six
shots.

Alter junior Libby Bazelak continued her torrid pace with a game-high 17 points.
She scored 24 in the win over Africentric. Braxtin Miller added 14 points and
nine rebounds.

"We shot 27 percent (16 of 58 from the floor)," Peck said. "When you shoot 27
percent and win, you're doing something else (defense) right."

North Canton Hoover 45, Beavercreek 30: In a career that spans 41 years, there's
not a lot Beaver-creek head coach Ed Zink hasn't done. Sunday's game was the
state's all-time winningest coach's debut at the Classic in the Country,
however. It didn't go as planned.

Creek (12-4) fell behind 22-13 at half and watched as Hoover (14-2) opened the
third quarter with a 13-2 run. Creek answered with a 13-1 run to close the
quarter and begin the fourth but an eight point deficit (twice) is as close as
Creek could climb.

Alter wins 11th straight, rips La Salle;
Rebounds, running game help the host Knights dominate the Lancers, 70-54.

KETTERING - The road has been kind to Alter's boys basketball team this season,
but there's no place like home sweet home.

Playing just their second home game of the season, the Knights showed Division I
La Salle and a sell-out crowd why they are ranked fourth in the state in Div. II
and No. 1 in the area by the Dayton Daily News.

Alter trailed 17-16 after one quarter, but cranked up the defense in the second
period and rode a 16-5 run to a 70-54 victory over the Lancers in a Greater
Catholic League interconference game.

"We really are the road warriors," said Knight coach Joe Petrocelli, whose team
won its 11th straight. "It really is something to be 13-1 when you're not
playing games at home. It's a lot better shooting the ball here than it is on
some of those courts."

La Salle coach Dan Fleming didn't share Petrocelli's warm feelings about playing
in Alter's gym.

The Lancers (12-4) made just 20-of-62 shots overall (32 percent), including a 2
for 11 showing (18 percent) from 3-point range in the second half.

The Knights made 27-or-47 shots (57 percent) and made 5-of-10 threes. "We lost
our patience and cranked it up from 3-point range pretty good," Fleming said.
"But obviously passing it inside wasn't doing any good because we couldn't find
anybody on our team to make a layup."

Alter's defense has been solid all season, giving up 45 points per game on
average. But it was the Knights' ability to rebound and run the floor that made
the biggest difference.

"I thought the best thing the kids did was rebound on the defensive end,"
Petrocelli said. "That's why we were able to get out on the break. Our running
game was in high-gear. We were getting the ball out and making some good
decisions going to the basket."

The Lancers used a full-court press much of the game, but Knights like Ryan
Siggins (23 points), Paris Harris (20) and J.J. Laumann (19) found plenty of
open holes. Petrocelli said Siggins had "a breakout game" after he watched the
sophomore guard lead all scorers.

Bobby Austin led La Salle with 20 points, but the senior guard made just 7 of 21
shots. "They seemed like they were over-pressuring the ball, so I just went
backdoor and went at the basket," said Siggins, who also had 7 rebounds and 4
assists.

Fleming said his team has struggled defensively all year, especially in big
games. "We tried everything - man, zone, pressure," he said. "This team is just
not very good at pressing. We don't read well. We can't guard the ball at all.
We don't have a guard in our program that can hone in on the ball. Our defense
is really poor. We just can't guard anybody."

Alter girls continue mastery of relay, advance to state

BYLINE: By Dave Long Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 404 words


DAYTON - There was no wasted motion from Ashley Rodgers.

Within the first 10 meters of her lead-off leg for Alter in the girls
3,200-meter relay she was in full get-in-front and stay-in-front mode.

"I knew we needed to get a lead fast and build up a cushion because teams really
come at you in the last 100 yards in the regional," she said.

Her unofficial time of 2: 19.5 in the opening 800 meters gave Alter a lead none
of the other 15 teams in the field could overcome. Alter won the 3,200 relay for
the fourth straight year during the opening session of the Dayton Division II
regional high school track and field meet Thursday, May 27, at Welcome Stadium.

Rodgers, a junior, teamed with sophomore Olivia Albers, freshman Austin Borton
and junior Rebecca Esselstein to get first in 9:25.72. Oakwood, which pushed the
Knights in the Dayton district final, was second in 9:33.95.

Both teams advance to the state meet Friday, June 4, and Saturday, June 5, at
Ohio State's Jesse Owens Stadium in Columbus.

Alter will be seeking its second straight state championship in the event.
Rodgers, Albers and Esselstein ran on the title team last season. Rodgers and
Esselstein have also been on three straight regional title teams.

"We pretty much know what we have to do during the race," said Esselstein. "But
we get together and talk. We knew we all had to go hard. Ashley got us a good
lead. We just had to hold it."

The four top finishers in each running and field event advance to state. The
second session is Saturday, May 29, at Welcome with field events beginning at
11:30 a.m. and finals at 12: 30 p.m.

* Dunbar sophomore Jaecob Snow won the boys long jump at 22-feet, 3 1/ 4 inches.
"This is sweet," said Snow, admiring his medal. "I have to get one at state to
match the one from basketball."

Snow was a reserve guard on Dunbar's D-II state championship basketball team.

Billy McGuire of Middletown Madison was third (21-5 1/2) and Darian Reynolds of
Chaminade Julienne fourth (21-5).

* Kevin Fink gave Tippecanoe the lead in the third leg of the boys 3,200 relay
and anchor Tyler Feitshans made it stand. The team of Luke Zerkle, Cody Conley,
Fink and Feitshans chopped six seconds off their previous best time to win in
8:05.08. Brookville was second (8:06.91), Versailles third (8:07.37) and
Clinton-Massie fourth (8: 08.29).

* Emily Adair of Urbana was the discus winner (120-5) with Jessica Dahnke of
Waynesville second (116-7).

Knights make clutch free throws to stay undefeated;
Alter has won its last three meetings against Beavercreek.

BYLINE: By Dave Long Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B9

LENGTH: 375 words


KETTERING - Ashley Christie had one of the worst shooting nights of her Alter
High School girls basketball career, going 3-for-19 on Saturday, Jan. 2.

She was, however, nothing but net from the free throw line going 10-for-10. Six
of those free-throws came in the final 19 seconds as Alter held off Beavercreek
56-51 before a full house at Alter.

With the win Alter, No. 1 in the Dayton Daily News Division II ratings, improved
to 8-0. Beavercreek, 5-2, suffered its second straight loss.

"Shooters have short memories," said Christie, who missed 12 straight shots from
the floor in the second half. "Those were free throws we needed to keep the
lead."

Alter hit 11 consecutive free-throws in the second half and was 17-of-21
overall. Christie was their leading scorer with 17 while Whitney Dabbelt and
Kaila Howe followed with 10 apiece.

Freshman Ally Myers had a career-high 17 points for Beavercreek.

"Free throws killed us on both ends of the floor," said Beavercreek coach Ed
Zink. "We've got the lead on them (45-43, 48-45), we have eight free-throw
chances and we go 1-for-2 (each time). They go down, we foul them and they are
perfect.

"I thought we played well most of the game, but just like against Fairmont we
didn't execute when we had our chances late in the game."

This was the third straight season Alter has defeated Beavercreek.

"That shows how far we've come the last few years," Alter coach Chis Hart said.
"Beavercreek is one of the top programs in the state. Now we're able to beat
them and draw a big crowd.

"It's really satisfying, especially since we didn't shoot the ball very well.
But that's a lot of credit to Beavercreek's defense."

Beavercreek led 25-19 at halftime. Alter went on a 10-2 run at the beginning of
the third quarter to built leads of 39-34 and 43-38. But Beavercreek led 45-43
on two Jaycey Hardenstein free throws with 3:47 to go. Beavercreek led again,
48-45, with 1:10 left.

Dabbelt tied the game at 48-all on a basket and free throw at 1:03. Courtney
Christie forced a Beavercreek turnover with 51 seconds left and Megan Courtney
put the Knights ahead for good, 50-48.

Alter is at Carroll on Wednesday in another tough game. "Big week for us," Hart
said. "How we do in these two will tell us a lot about ourselves."

With Alter, the defense never rests;
Knights routed rival C-J Saturday and have given up just 50 points in first two
games.

BYLINE: By Ron Jackson Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 372 words


KETTERING - No, that wasn't a misprint Saturday. Alter High School's girls
basketball team dispatched Chaminade-Julienne 61-35.

The Knights outscored C-J 17-3 in the decisive third period. Leading the charge
was the Christie sister act of Nicole (13 points) and Ashley (12). Nicole played
at C-J last season.

"We downplayed that angle," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "We're glad they're
here. They've added a lot of depth to our backcourt."

Alter played excellent defense in its first two wins over Indian Hill (79-15)
and C-J. Eagles coach Marc Greenberg came away impressed with his Girls Greater
Cincinnati League rival.

"They have a lot of 5-foot-9, 5-foot-11 girls - tall and long - and they play
physical," said Greenberg, whose team is in its first year in the tough GGCL.
"They know how to close up the passing lanes on the defensive end. To solve it
you need quick ball movement, and we didn't do that. We couldn't get the ball
inside. They were knocking down 3-point shots.

"We're not in a panic mode," Greenberg added of the uncharacteristic 26-point
setback. "We're looking forward to the rematch in February."

Tenacious defense has been a staple under Hart. Her team uses a tight
man-to-man, and that helps explain why the Knights are fivetime defending
champions in the GGCL Grey Division. Last year they were 21-3.

"We work on defensive principles every day in practice," said Dartmouth-bound
Louise Vanden-Bosch, a 5-foot-10 center. "Contain, dribble, drive and play
sturdy defense are what we're all about."

Taking a page from coach Pat Summitt's playbook at the University of Tennessee,
Hart and her staff bring in the "P Squad," a practice team made up of boys who
play other sports, including the state final football team.

"You only get better playing quicker, bigger and stronger people," Hart said.
"We bring them in almost every practice."

Said VandenBosch, who is the team's leading scorer at 12 points a game: "It
makes us box out harder and play more physical. We mix it up. We know if we can
beat the boys, we can beat the girls."

Joining VandenBosch in the starting lineup are Megan Waterman, Sara Tahy,
Courtney Chihio and Moira Cummins. The Christie sibling act gives the Knights an
offensive burst off the bench.

Ferocity back in the Wildcats

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 584 words


Mission No. 1: Forget last year's 1-9 debacle.

Mission No. 2: Get the ball in the hands of hard-running halfback Josh Horn.

If that is accomplished, the Franklin High School football team will have no
problem leaving behind its past disappointments.

There seems to be some ferocity back in the Wildcats as their 22-15 opening win
over Warren County foe Carlisle attests. It was Franklin's first opening win in
10 years. Horn rushed for 161 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns to
spark Franklin over the D-IV playoff aspirant.

"Josh is tough as nails," said Wildcats second-year coach Deron Click. "In our
last scoring drive of 73 yards, he rushed for over 40 yards. He wore Carlisle's
defense down. Our players made a commitment to the weight room in the offseason.
We've had five or ten players leave the last couple years because of our levy
situation, but the players who stayed believe in the program and have faith in
the community (a levy finally passed Aug. 2 after seven defeats)."

Defensive stalwarts in the Carlisle win were ends Ben Jones (six solos, two
assists and a recovered fumble) and Brian Hill (six tackles and three sacks).
Franklin hosts Little Miami this Friday in another Warren County matchup.

Alter, Fairmont reach facilities agreement

Alter's 10-7 football victory against Fairmont on Friday was an intense on-field
battle. But the neighboring Kettering schools have reached some important
compromises off the field.

The schools have reached an agreement in principle that Alter will call Chester
A. Roush Stadium home starting in 2006.

The scheduling details must be worked out between the Greater Catholic League
and Greater Western Ohio Conference. That will enable both schools to play home
games on Friday nights.

A similar arrangement between Alter Athletics Director Chris Hart and Fairmont
AD Rick Robertson will enable Alter's basketball teams to play some games in the
new James Trent Arena next to Fairmont High School.

The agreements were announced at the Dor-Wood Optimist Club meeting this past
Thursday and before Friday's stadium dedication.

Roush was a longtime Fairmont administrator whose teams were 26-0-2 and won
three Miami Valley League championships. He was the school's superintendent for
15 years and retired in 1975.

Tilley transfers from Springfield South

Springfield South's offense suffered a setback with the transfer of senior Lee
Tilley, a 6-foot-7, 295-pound offensive lineman.

Tilley, ranked No. 70 among the nation's top 100 prep players by the Sporting
News, is expected to play for Franklin Heights in Columbus. The two-year starter
at South is being recruited by major Division I programs Auburn, Florida,
Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Washington, among others.

The decision to non-renew Tony Broering's position as head coach led to
speculation several Wildcats players would transfer from South. Tilley will
reunite with former South offensive coordinator Jeremy Beckham, was hired at
Franklin Heights in early August according to reports. Tilley won't have to sit
out according to Ohio High School Athletic Association guidelines since he plans
to move into the district.

South beat Dunbar 43-13 in Friday night's season opener and travels to Troy this
Friday for the Dayton Daily News Game of The Week.

News Analysis; Pentium PC price cuts on the way; Corporate shift to Intel's MMX
will depend on price, not performance

By Andy Santoni and Carolyn A. April

SECTION: CLIENT; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 591 words

Desktop Pentium systems may be a bargain next month when MMX-enhanced
 systems hit the market and OEMs project an end-of-month price cut from Intel.


 The desktop PC market is becoming more competitive, especially as OEMs target

 consumers, said Karen Alter, director of microprocessor marketing and
 business planning at Intel.  Alter forecast a quick transition from Pentium
 to Pentium MMX based on consumer demand, but the Pentium processor will not
 go away quickly.

 "I still expect quite a high volume of Pentium systems next year," Alter
 said.

 Alter would not comment on how Pentium prices will fare at the next quarterly

 price cut, scheduled for the end of January or the beginning of February.  An

 Intel representative would only say that Pentium MMX processors will be
 priced at the high end of the Pentium lineup.  Processor speeds will be at
 the high end, too, the representative noted: 166 MHz and 200 MHz for desktop

 devices and 150 MHz and 166 MHz for notebooks.

 However, some industry analysts expect pricing to be aggressive.  At their
 introduction early in January, Pentium MMX systems will demand only a small
 price premium over Pentium systems, said James L. Turley, senior analyst at
 MicroDesign Resources, in Sunnyvale, Calif.  He expects Pentium MMX
 processors to be priced just $20 more than similar Pentium devices, which
 should yield a system price differential of about $100.

 This small price differential should convince users to shift to MMX systems,

 Turley said.  As a result, system OEMs and end-users may lose interest in
 Pentiums with-out MMX, he noted.  To IS managers wondering when they will get

 the best price on Pentium systems, Turley suggested: "Your odds are better
 after Christmas."

 Observers agreed that prices for Pentium systems should drop as the market
 moves to MMX, but they differ on when this will occur.

 "I think we will see the same model as when Intel went from Pentium to
 Pentium Pro," said Frank Dzubeck, an industry analyst with Communications
 Architects, in Washington.  "You'll see a gradual price reduction in
 Pentiums; then it will fall off a cliff."

 An Intel competitor agreed that Pentium prices won't drop soon.  A cut in
 Pentium prices wouldn't push acceptance of Pentium MMX devices, said Steve
 Tobak, vice president of corporate and channel marketing at Cyrix, in
 Richardson, Texas.

 A handful of PC purveyors said pricing of MMX processors by Intel will be
 aggressive, and this will be the catalyst for price cuts on Pentium-based
 systems sooner rather than later.

 "We see some huge pricing actions coming up to get rid of inventory," said an

 official at one PC vendor, who requested anonymity.  Corporate IS buyers will

 be motivated by the low prices, he said.

 Dave Berger, director of product marketing at Gateway, said his company does

 not expect to render sharp price cuts immediately in non-MMX Pentium systems.


 "We expect to have less than a $100 price difference between comparably
 configured MMX and non-MMX systems," Berger said.

 Intel Corp., in Santa Clara, Calif., can be reached at (800) 548-4725.

technology to new heights, creating gadgets that don't simply collect data on
the body but can alter the user's physical and mental state.850 by Heather
Somerville in Los Gatos, Calif. MOVEDPHOTOS


LOS GATOS, Calif. - Grandmothers are wearing Fitbit, Jawbone bracelets pack the
shelves of big-box stores and Apple's smartwatch is expected to be one of the
most coveted Christmas gifts this year.

Wearable technology - wireless-connected gadgets that come in the form of
eyeglasses, bracelets, wristwatches and other small accessories for the body -
have gone from nerdy and outlandish devices to popular purchases for the average
consumer, a sign of how comfortable we have become with tracking our daily
activities, whether it's how well we sleep or how many calories we burn.

Now entrepreneurs are working to push the technology to new heights, creating
gadgets that don't simply collect data on the body but can alter the user's
physical and mental state. It's a largely underexplored area that offers the
potential to alleviate pain and improve brain functionality, but also carries a
host of concerns about whether using startup technology to change our body
chemistry poses unnecessary risks.

Thync, a startup based in the Bay Area town of Los Gatos, launched publicly last
week with a device that sends electricity to the user's nerves to alter their
mood and mental state. The user has two options: become calmer or more
energized. The mood-altering fix is delivered through a Bluetooth-connected
headpiece, a strip attached to the neck or behind the ear to stimulate nerves
that emerge directly from the brain, and a smartphone. Leave your yoga mat or
Red Bull at home.

Are people looking for some sort of stimulant to alter their mental state?
Unequivocally, yes, said Luis Rincon, co-founder and CEO of Wearables.com , a
research and review site. So there absolutely is a consumer appetite for this,
and that's been the case for millenniums. What's new is we are now entering a
phase where technology can provide that stimulant.

Mind and body manipulation can be scary terrain, but easy-to-use devices such as
Fitbit have paved the way for wearables 2.0. With a growing market and explosion
of new companies - not to mention the gorilla of consumer electronics storming
onto the scene in April with the Apple Watch - companies such as Thync are
looking to stand out from the crowd.

All wearables today are trackers, said Thync co-founder and CEO Isy Goldwasser.
Our wearable is working in synergy with the body.

Other companies are going a step further to offer medical treatment or therapy.
Massachusetts-based Quell, for instance, sells a wearable that uses electrodes
to provide chronic pain relief for those with fibromyalgia, sciatica, arthritis
and other ailments.

The Consumer Electronics Association predicts 10.8 million wearable devices will
ship in 2015, up from more than 3 million last year. Technology research firm
Gartner predicts that 70 million to 100 million devices will be purchased in
2016. While not yet as ubiquitous as the smartphone, wearables are on their way.

Tech investors have thrown their collective hat in the wearable ring - to the
tune of $635 million from July 2014 through June 1, according to PitchBook, a
research and data provider. That's a nearly fourfold increase from the previous
year, when VCs invested $172 million in the space.

That level of investment shows us that it's not just a fad, and it's something
that's going to be around for a long time, Rincon said.

Thync has raised $13 million from investors including Khosla Ventures. Its
founders, Jamie Tyler, a neuroscience expert and Arizona State University
associate professor, and Goldwasser, a longtime tech executive, have spent the
last year and a half testing the device on 3,500 people.

We spent a very long time trying to beat the placebo effect, Goldwasser said.
People can put it on and we don't have any doubt that it's working.

They have tracked changes in users' temperature, body chemistry and facial
expressions - all of which are altered as electrical pulses from an iPhone are
transmitted into the skin and through the nerves that act as superhighways to
the brain. The idea, the founders said, was to give busy people an alternative
to alcohol or Red Bull - which many professionals use to wind down or rev up.
The device starts at $299.

Most people don't meditate; most people don't have the time, Tyler said. It's
sad, but that's the world we live in.

The San Jose Mercury News tried Thync, finding the calm vibrations did indeed
have an effect: Breath slowed, anxiety disappeared, facial tension relaxed and
worries gave way to a still mind. But unlike meditation, the sensation arrived
as an outside force and felt inauthentic, and therefore slightly unnerving. And
the sedateness lasted only briefly - less than an hour - perhaps due to keeping
the strength of the electrical stimulation at a minimum. These are, after all,
electronic currents from a cellphone going directly into one's forehead.

It's probably no more crazy than taking a bunch of supplements that you don't
really know anything about, said Steve Holmes, Intel's vice president of new
devices. But just to do it recreationally, I would be cautious.

Alter plays familiar name in state tournament

BYLINE: By Greg Billing Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 388 words


The Division II high school girls basketball state semifinal between Alter and
Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown is a tournament rematch by name, but that's about
it.

Both rosters have seen turnover since Alter's 60-46 win in the title game last
year. The Knights and Blazers both return two starters from those lineups.

"Probably not in our wildest dreams did we think we would make it back this
quickly," Alter coach Chris Hart said. "We were young last year, but we thought
coming into the season we were very young."

Alter (24-2) plays Hathaway Brown (19-6) at 3 p.m. on Friday, March 20, at Ohio
State University's Schottenstein Center. Wapakoneta (24-1) plays Warsaw River
View (23-2) in the early semifinal at 1 p.m.

Scouting report

HB coach Paul Barlow said the Blazers would rather play a transition game than
trade half-court sets. They saw a majority of zone defense, which could pose
problems early with Alter's aggressive man defense.

Junior wing Mylan Woods leads the team with 16.4 points per game and junior post
Erica Almady, a Lakota West transfer, chips in 12.7. Alter's offense can expect
to see half-court man defense.

Fair weather fans

Coaches don't like making predictions. But there is one forecast they will
gladly welcome. Temperatures for the end of the week are expected to be in the
50s. That's better than the nearly 16 inches of snow that brought Columbus to a
standstill last year.

"No snow this year," Hart said with a laugh. "We like that."

HB Bills?

This is Hathaway Brown's third straight trip to state. HB lost in the 2007 final
to Warsaw River View 45-26 and last year to Alter. How do the Blazers prevent
that from becoming a stumbling block mentally?

"You tell them we don't want to be the Buffalo Bills," Barlow said.

"We just reinforce the last two years we worked hard to get to the final four.
You have to believe if you get down here enough things will go your way one of
these times."

Quote

"Two years in a row when you're going to play them down there you're going
develop a little bit of a rivalry, so to speak. I think our kids are excited to
get another crack at it. We certainly respect everything they do. But I think
our kids are looking forward to the opportunity to redeem themselves from last
year." - Barlow.

Knights roll in showdown;
Alter, Kenton Ridge will play for a place in state final four.;
GIRLS BASKETBALL ALTER 56, CLINTON-MASSIE 33

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

Alter's Braxtin Miller brings the ball up as Massie's Miquela Santoro tries to
defend. Miller finished with 12 points as the Knights won the matchup of
unbeaten teams in the Division II regional semifinals at Springfield.

SPRINGFIELD - If it weren't proclaimed before, it's official now: Alter has
something special brewing this girls basketball season.

Lights-out shooting and shut-down defense are its trademarks. And those traits
were at their season's best in Tuesday's 56-33 rub-out of Clinton-Massie in a
showdown of unbeatens in the Division II regional semifinals at a
capacity-filled Springfield High School.

Alter had six players knock down 3-pointers by halftime.

"This is a special team," Alter junior Maddie Bazelak said after leading the
Knights with 15 points and hitting three 3s. "We knew it from the beginning that
this was a special team. We've worked all season to be able to hit those shots
in pressure situations like this. Any one of us at any time can be the big
player like that. That's what's special about us."

Kenton Ridge nearly squandered all of a 17-point second-half edge but held on to
beat Columbus Eastmoor Academy in the opener, 59-58.

Alter (27-0) and Ridge (26-1) will return in Friday's 7:30 p.m. regional final.
The winner advances to next week's D-II state final four in Columbus.

Massie, fueled by 6-foot-1 seniors Sydney Brackemyre (a University of Louisville
signee) and Kasey Eutrecht (Northern Kentucky), trailed throughout.

By the end of the first quarter Alter led by 10 and had hit four of five 3s by
four players. The Knights' advantage was 31-12 at halftime and ballooned to
44-18 after three quarters. Ball game.

Emma Bockrath, Libby Bazelak, Braxtin Miller, Hayley Combs and Kara Bockrath
joined Maddie Bazelak in busting 3s for Alter.

"We shot the ball well," conceded Alter coach Chris Hart. "The kids who hit
those 3s can hit those any night."

Miller, an outstanding freshman shooting guard, added 12 points for the Knights.
Brackemyre led Massie with 11 points. Alter hit eight treys, Massie none.

"We were able to get in their heads a little," said Maddie Bazelak.

Sara Thornton hit 10 free throws, the last with 17 seconds remaining, to secure
Kenton Ridge's win. Eastmoor hit a 3 to close within one with seven seconds left
but couldn't foul on the inbounds. That allowed Ridge to run out the clock on
Eastmoor's season.

"We're happy to go on," Ridge coach Ed Foulk said.

"Now it's going to be a tough one. We've got to play better than we just played,
too. Way better."

Thornton led the Cougars with 18 points.

Competition all in the family for RB;
Chris Borland, the sixth of seven athletic siblings to attend Alter, hopes to
beat foes - and his brother.

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

LENGTH: 514 words


KETTERING - If Alter goes as deep into high school football playoffs as it did
last season, Chris Borland has a chance of winning a bet he made with his
brother, Matt.

Chris is a junior running back for Alter, which will go for a perfect 10-0
regular season vs. Chaminade-Julienne on Friday night. The Knights already have
qualified for the state Division IV playoffs and will host its first-round game
Nov. 2.

Matt Borland is a sophomore forward on the nationally ranked Wittenberg
University soccer team in Springfield.

Their bet is that Chris will have more touchdowns this season than Matt scores
goals.

"I'm behind right now," Chris said. "I've got six touchdowns, and he had
something like eight or nine goals. Maybe Coach (Alter coach Ed Domsitz) will
make me the designated back when we get close to the goal line so I can get some
more TDs."

The Borlands have been involved with athletics at Alter for more than 10 years.
Chris and Matt, a 2005 graduate, are two of seven children in the family - six
of them boys.

Joe is a 1997 graduate; Mark, 2000; and John, 2003.

There is a younger brother, Luke, who is in sixth grade.

Sarah, the only girl, graduated from Alter in 1995. She was a cheerleader and
gymnast. Joe lettered in both football and soccer in high school and was a
cheerleader at Miami University. Mark was a four-year basketball starter at
Wittenberg, and John was a four-year soccer player at West Point. Sarah, now a
teacher in the Chicago area, played intramural rugby at Ohio University. Chris
is the only one of the crew (so far) who has been a four-year football player.
"I played soccer until the eighth grade but decided I like football more," he
said. Their parents, Jeff and Zebbie, have logged untold miles taking their boys
from one practice to another and watching games. "For a while there, it was
pretty hectic," Zebbie said. "It seemed like we were all over the country
watching them play. It's slowed down a little now with Chris' football games on
Friday and a lot of Matt's soccer games on Sunday."

Jeff Borland has his own financial company, the Borland Group, which allows him
the freedom to get to a lot of games.

Chris will probably see more carries the rest of the season with fullback Justin
Hall out with a knee injury.

Last year, the Knights went 14-1, losing to Steubenville in the state
championship game, 34-33.

"I know we're a lot better team offensively than we were last year because we
have a better passing game," Chris said. "Austin (quarterback Austin Boucher)
can really throw the ball and that opens up the running game a lot more.

"We lost a lot of guys off our defense. But we've gotten better on 'D' each
week. A lot of guys have gotten playing time, and that will help in the
playoffs."

Football isn't done for Borland when the season is over.

There are the annual family backyard "touch" football games on Thanksgiving Day
and Christmas Day.

"We're all pretty competitive," Chris said. "So the hitting in those games is
sometimes harder than in the high school games."

Fraud artist pleads guilty: Nepean man stole thousands from seniors in phone
scams

BYLINE: GARY DIMMOCK; THE OTTAWA CITIZEN

SECTION: CITY; Pg. E1 / Front


A Nepean man has admitted to swindling elderly United States residents out of
hundreds of thousands of dollars in a telemarketing scheme that solicited money
for prizes that didn't exist.

Jules Alter, 45, who ran the Nepean-based Consolidated Premium Group, pleaded
guilty to one count each of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and money
laundering in U.S. District Court in New Jersey yesterday.

The businessman expressed remorse and apologized in court before a dozen senior
citizens who wore buttons that read: "Fraud Busters." Mr. Alter faces a maximum
of 40 years in U.S. prison without parole and a $ 1-million fine.

Mr. Alter admitted that his employees telephoned U.S. residents, mostly senior
citizens, and told them they had won a sweepstakes or contest and would receive
a prize or cash. But to claim the prize, they were told, they had to pay a fee
that was supposed to cover taxes and promotional expenses, the court heard.

The victims included a New Jersey woman who lost $ 199,000 U.S., which she sent
to the Nepean company to claim a bogus $ 3-million prize. Mr. Alter said one of
his employees solicited the woman between October 1996 and February 1997.

He also acknowledged that a co-conspirator swindled $ 36,000 U.S. from a victim
in Alabama, $ 22,000 from a Pennsylvania resident and $ 25,000 from a person in
Georgia.

In all, the telemarketing scheme raked in $ 1.3 million, money that was
transferred to a bank account registered to J.A. Canadian Business & Office
Supply, also owned by Mr. Alter.

The fraud artist and his employees directed the victims to send certified
cheques via overnight courier to a post office box in Nepean.

Mr. Alter's guilty plea was entered after federal prosecutors agreed to withdraw
15 other counts of fraud-related charges.

However, U.S. Attorney Faith S. Hochberg said yesterday the severity of the
dismissed charges will be considered at sentencing, scheduled for March 12.

Mr. Alter was arrested May 8 when he crossed the border by car into New York
State.

He has been in jail without bail since he was arrested by special FBI agents.

The Nepean businessman became a suspect in the early 1990s when several people
complained to authorities. The complaints sparked an Ontario Consumer and
Corporate Affairs investigation into the company.

At the time of the first investigation, Mr. Alter said his company had not made
such promises and did not pressure anyone to send money.

"Let's be honest," he told the Citizen.

"There's nothing free in this world."

Mr. Alter's employees began targeting senior citizens for fraud in 1993, the
indictment said.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy McInnis said yesterday he intends to seek at
least $ 1 million U.S. in restitution from the admitted fraud artist.

The telemarketing task force of the Ontario Provincial Police, the FBI and the
RCMP worked on the case.

KETTERING - Students at Alter High School had a day off Friday, but the faculty
and staff spent the day working hard to create a vision for current and future
students, and for the school.

Alter also invited more than 200 members of the community to help them create a
strategic five-year plan at its convocation held Sept. 29-30.

"This is what this process today is all about," said the Rev. James Manning,
president of Alter, in his opening remarks.

"People with diverse backgrounds coming together to build a future for Alter -
to chart our course and put Alter on the map as the leader and on the cutting
edge of education for the future."

Last spring, Alter staff and faculty laid the groundwork for the convocation by
identifying nine planning areas and 40 challenges associated with the planning
areas.

Some of the planning areas were spiritual life, student life, technology, and
faculty and staff.

Members attending the convocation were assigned to small groups to explore the
meaning and challenges associated with a particular planning area.

The faculty and staff planning area group included several Alter faculty
members, a chief of police, a superintendent of a public school district,
parents, a retired diocesan assistant superintendent and public school teachers.

Paul Zimmer, an Alter grad and local attorney, led the group as they explored
five challenges facing the faculty and staff.

After a day and a half, the group had to identify what they felt was the No. 1
challenge, and identify up to three solutions.

On Saturday, participants from the convocation gathered in the cafeteria while
each group reported on its No. 1 challenge and possible solutions.

Each participant then voted for 20 of the 40 challenges, in a process called
multivoting.

The planning areas of student life, faculty and staff, academics, and
development and marketing received the most votes.

Frank Donaldson of the Institute of School and Parish Development in New Orleans
oversaw the process.

He said his company has been working with Alter for the past 10 months.

"This is great - the energy and enthusiasm," Donaldson said. "The facilitators
are doing a good job of engaging people in conversation."

Jennifer Butler, a faculty member at Alter, was enthused about the process.

"I think it's amazing - the community involvement we're experiencing," Butler
said.

"The community is thinking of all the strengths, weaknesses, threats and
opportunities (of the faculty and staff planning area) that we never thought of,
which is the whole point. It's very valuable input."

After the convocation ended, Manning said, "My job is to lead this school into
the future. The people have spoken."

Donaldson said his company will present their recommendations based on the
results of the convocation to Alter's board of trustees by November, and expects
implementation of some ideas before the end of the year.

A hip get-well wish from Liz

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 114 words


Imagine you're going into the hospital and you get a get-well card from
Elizabeth Taylor, who probably doesn't know you from Adam.

That's what happened to Bill Alter, 63, of Hobe Sound, Fla., due for hip
replacement surgery today.

He was shocked to receive a signed card with an "I'll be thinking of you"
message. "He didn't really believe it was Elizabeth Taylor," says Mary Lou
Alter, 28, who wrote Taylor after she heard the star faced the same surgery her
dad did. Her plea: "I know it would add to his recovery if you could add a few
words of inspiration."

Alter knows "how much pain my father is in. She had to be in as much. I can't
believe she took the time."

Despite Simmons, Alter drops opener;
FLYIN' TO THE HOOP NOTES

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 355 words


KETTERING - With three straight losses, Alter's boys high school basketball team
is hurting, but there's nothing wrong with Jaaron Simmons.

The junior guard put a game-high 24 points on Christian Faith Center Academy
(Creedmoor, N.C.) but the Knights dropped Friday's Flyin' to the Hoop opener at
Fairmont's Trent Arena, 59-51.

Simmons, 6 feet 1, continues to draw recruiting interest from the University of
Dayton despite former Flyers coach Brian Gregory having left for Georgia Tech.

"Dayton's been involved a lot," Simmons said. "Definitely. It's a hometown
school. That's always a nice fit."

Alter (4-5) hosts Elder (1-8) today.

"This won't hurt us, but playing Elder might," said veteran Knights coach Joe
Petrocelli. "We need to get a 'W' somewhere."

No show: It didn't take long for Flyin' to experience its first hiccup.

Founder Eric Horstman was notified two hours before Friday's opening tip-off
that Morgan Park (Ill.) would not attend. The suburban Chicago public school's
travel itinerary had been denied by school officials at that late hour.

"You know how I always fear that call?" Flyin' founder Eric Horstman asked.
"Well, I got that call."

Springboro was matched with Morgan Park on Sunday and Vandalia Butler was to
play MP on Monday. Now, Springboro will play HYCA (Texas) and Horst-man lured
Lakota East to play Butler.

It was the first time Morgan Park would have played at Fly-in'. And for their
Flyin' future? They're grounded, implied Horst-man.

Where's Dunbar? The Wolverines have been Flyin' regulars since the Daequan Cook
era, but not this year.

Dunbar, the state's top-ranked Division II team, was to have played Findlay Prep
(Nev.) but would have had to drop a City League game to do so. That wasn't going
to happen.

Dunbar coach Pete Pullen tried to reschedule Consortium College Prep (Detroit)
to Flyin', but they're in their own Michigan holiday tourney. Dunbar will host
CCP on Jan. 28.

"It just didn't work out for us," said Pullen.

Crowd control: The arena was about two-thirds filled for both of Friday's games,
a great crowd considering most area teams were playing elsewhere. There are six
more games today.

Mussoorie Palika felicitates Bob Alter

LENGTH: 687 words

DATELINE: DEHRADUN


DEHRADUN, April 27 -- By our staff reporterMussoorie, 26 Apr: Nagar Palika
President OP Uniyal felicitated the reputed Rev Robert C Alter, father of famous
writer Stephen Alter and uncle of actor Tom Alter at his home in Oak Will
Cottage in Cantt area, here, today. Uniyal, along with some members, reached
Alter's home and presented a bouquet of flowers and a shawl to Rev Alter and
wished him good health and long life.He said that Alter had done a lot of work
for the poor and the villagers near Mussoorie, which was unforgettable. He
further said that there were few persons who didn't think only about their
community, but also for others.Tom Alter said that throughout his life Rev Alter
had maintained a unique relationship with, both, Woodstock School and the people
of Garhwal. Rev Alter was born in 1926 in Srinagar, Kashmir to American
missionary parents.

He attended Woodstock School, where his father was Principal and graduated as a
member of the Class of 1943. He then attended Westminster College in New
Wilmington, Pennsylvania in the USA.After graduation, Rev Alter returned to
teach at Woodstock, where he was joined by his fianc'e, Ellen. They were married
in Parker Hall in 1948, and both taught at Woodstock until 1951. At that time,
they returned to the United States, where Rev Alter attended Yale Divinity
School and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1955. The couple returned
to India in 1956 as missionaries with the Presbyterian Church (USA), assigned to
the Rural Church Programme of the North India Synod of the United Church of
North India. Alter initiated an economic development programme for village
Christians in central Uttar Pradesh, which he continued to develop for ten
years. During that time, his interest in village work led to an MA in Rural
Sociology from Cornell University in 1962.In 1966, Rev Alter accepted an
invitation to serve as Business Manager at Woodstock for one year, a job which
led to other positions at Woodstock for the next ten years, including that of
Superintendent. During his tenure as Development Director, he wrote a strategic
planning document that shaped the future of Woodstock as an international,
Christian school. Although Rev Alter's achievements at Woodstock were
monumental, his influence eventually extended much further into the Garhwali
hillside. In 1979, he was assigned to manage the sale and transfer of United
Presbyterian Property in Mussoorie and Kodaikanal. In addition to this
assignment, he was asked by the Board of the Christian Retreat & Study Centre in
Rajpur to help start a 'community development' project in villages in and around
Rajpur and Mussoorie as part of the Centre's outreach program. This project
evolved into MGVS, the Mussoorie Gramin Vikas Samiti, a holistic, integrated
rural community development programmes which emphasised helping people identify
and resolve problems within their own communities. Alter acted as Coordinator of
MGVS until his retirement in 1994. As part of his work with MGVS, he oversaw
such vital work as healthcare improvement, village dairy surveys, an ecosystems
evaluation, a women's literacy project and a number of women's income-generating
activities. Alter also worked with the construction of a significant drinking
water pipeline, for which he is still known as the "water sahib". His
experiences and reflections on development were published in 2002 in his book
entitled Water for Pabolee. In addition to his involvement with Woodstock and
MGVS, Alter served on the Board of KWI as President and Council member for many
years. He and Ellen now live in retirement at Wooster, Ohio. The two return to
India each year to spend a few months in their home and among their friends in
Mussoorie.On the occasion, his wife Ellen, grand-daughter Shivani, grand-son
Jayant, Tom Alter's son James, Ajay Mark, member Sushil Aggarwal, Jai Kumar
Gupta, Erik, and Monika Robert were present. Published by HT Syndication with

Tree-planting legacy grows DU dedicates arboretum

BYLINE: By J. Sebastian Sinisi, Denver Post Staff Writer

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-02

LENGTH: 605 words


A tree grows at the University of Denver - actually several hundred of them,
with more coming after Friday's official dedication of the Chester M. Alter
Arboretum on Arbor Day, the traditional day for planting trees.

The ceremony, which drew about 150 past and present faculty members, alumni,
trustees and officials, was moved indoors because of the weather - which was
fine for trees but not ideal for outdoor speeches.

It also marked the formal adoption of DU's arboretum effort, which builds upon a
tree-planting legacy that started more than a century ago.

Taking in the entire campus, the DU arboretum is named in honor of Alter, who
served as university chancellor from 1953 to 1967.

During his tenure, Alter oversaw construction of several buildings on campus.
But he always promoted a need to balance campus development with open spaces of
planted beauty, DU Chancellor Dan Ritchie said during Friday's ceremony.

A highly regarded chemist who worked on the Manhattan Project and helped develop
the atom bomb during World War II, Alter liked to say, "A lot of learning takes
place in the open spaces between buildings."

On his watch at DU, Alter - now 93 - was an environmentalist ahead of his time
and pushed efforts to beautify the campus, including the Harper Humanities
Gardens and other landscaping projects. He also had the 1880s Evans Chapel,
about to be demolished at its old Downtown location, moved to the campus in
1960.

"I was given a love of trees at age 5 by my father," Alter said in an interview,
recalling boyhood days on a farm in Rush County, Ind. "One sycamore tree was a
good friend," he said. "It was my hideout and my place to escape - a place of
solitude where I could think, meditate or read."

Fittingly, the first tree to be added to the campuswide arboretum will be a
sycamore.

In contrast to botanic gardens, arboretums offer labeled collections of trees,
shrubs and woody plants. Some 60 U.S. college campuses have arboretums - with
some of the larger ones at Harvard, Yale, Stanford and the Universities of
Wisconsin and Minnesota.

To qualify as a bona fide arboretum - or a living, scientific collection of
woody plants - DU will label all of its trees and shrubs and obtain
certification from the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta.

During Friday's ceremony, Dean of Natural Sciences Robert Coombe called
arboretums "living laboratories" whose function goes beyond the aesthetic.

Alter modestly said that the DU arboretum should have been named for DU biology
professor emeritus Moras Shubert, a key organizing force behind the arboretum
effort. Shubert also helped establish the Denver Botanic Gardens and is working
on a guide to identify the roughly 400 species of trees on campus.  DU started
as a seminary in 1864, a dozen years before Colorado became a state. But by
1885, its location in today's LoDo - amid streets boasting saloons and brothels
- was considered unsavory, and trustees sought a new location.

Trustee John Evans convinced Rufus "Potato" Clark to sell 150 acres of south
Denver prairie land to the seminary for $ 10,500 in 1886. In the contract, Clark
insisted that DU plant 1,000 trees on the grassland.

Within a year of moving from DU's Downtown site, the thousand trees had been
planted. But time, elm disease and other forms of attrition took a heavy toll.

"What makes American college campuses unique in the world is their open spaces,
trees and plant life," Ritchie said after the ceremony.    Asked Alter: "What
would this campus look like today if Rufus Clark hadn't had the foresight to
insist on those trees?"

Book turns table on reporter // Critics: It's a vendetta

BYLINE: James Cox

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 411 words


A reporter who chronicled the sex scandal that undid a Minnesota gubernatorial
candidate is targeted by a new book that critics call a vendetta and the authors
call fair play.

Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter Allen Short helped break the story that forced
Independent-Republican Jon Grunseth out of the governor's race last year.

Short wrote about allegations that Grunseth tried to molest a 13-year-old girl
while skinny dipping at a party in 1981. Grunseth denied the incident but quit
the race after his former mistress came forward to question his credibility.

Grunseth aides Leon Oistad and David Hoium look to get even in There is No
November , a book they wrote and are paying an undisclosed sum to have published
by a tiny Twin Cities press. In a chapter called ''Coming Up Short,'' they
portray the reporter as sloppy and ruthless.

They also write about Short's acknowledged marital problems, arguing that he was
hypocritical to write what he did about Grunseth.

''The Allen Shorts of the world feel they have every right to delve into the
lives of others but any scrutiny of them is off limits,'' says Oistad. ''I don't
subscribe to that view.''

The authors are missing the point, says Newsweek media critic Jonathan Alter.

''Not all smut is equally newsworthy,'' says Alter, who argues that public
officials and journalists can't be held to the same standards.

''If these aides had found that Short had sexually molested underage girls,''
Alter says, ''would that have been newsworthy? Yes. ... But to say he had
ordinary personal difficulties and exploit those out of proportion is
transparent score settling.''

Short read galleys of the book and found ''serious factual errors.'' He says he
has not decided if he'll sue.

''I've had people challenge my reporting, and I think that's a legitimate thing
to do. But that's far different from what happened in this case,'' he says.

Barry Bingham Jr., publisher of the journalism ethics newsletter FineLine, says
Oistad and Hoium are no different from other politicians who have sought to

Nixon syndrome.''

Grunseth remains bitter, unemployed and insistent that he never molested anyone.
Short, he says, is learning painfully that ''you reap what you sow.''

Contrary to what media watchers might think, says Grunseth, ''this book has all
the potential of becoming an absolute classic for schools of journalism.''

Hepatitis C May Be Hidden Epidemic, Studies Show

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

SECTION: Section A; Page 20; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 1041 words


In a finding that has surprised medical scientists, a new study shows that once
a person is infected with the hepatitis C virus, which causes the most common
form of viral hepatitis in the United States, the virus remains in the blood for
years, even when there are no signs or symptoms of liver inflammation.

In contrast, just a small portion of people infected with hepatitis B, which
also causes hepatitis, go on to become chronic carriers.

But a second study provides some reassurance, indicating that for the first 20
years after infection the death rate in people with hepatitis C may be no higher
than that in similar but uninfected people. The finding indicates that the virus
can be extraordinarily indolent even though it is a leading cause of cirrhosis,
liver failure and liver cancer in this country.

The new research, by Dr. Miriam J. Alter of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Washington
and their colleagues, is being published today in The New England Journal of
Medicine. Hepatitis experts say the studies help flesh out an emerging picture
of a silent epidemic that is only now becoming appreciated.

The studies "are revelations of a sort," said Dr. Jules Dienstag, a hepatitis
expert at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

'Poorly Reported Disease'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 150,000
Americans are infected each year with hepatitis C, and that 8,000 to 10,000 die
each year from consequences of the infection.

But, Dr. Alter said, "it's a very poorly reported disease and it's extremely
difficult to come up with accurate estimates."

Dr. Seeff said that the usual estimates almost certainly understated the
disease's prevalence because they were derived from studies of blood donors and
that hepatitis C was most common among poor people, who do not often donate
blood, and intravenous drug users, who are not permitted to donate. Since 1990,
blood has been screened for evidence of the virus.

At his own hospital, Dr. Seeff said, 40 percent of the people admitted had
hepatitis C, although almost none of them knew it.

"I believe that hepatitis C is a tremendously common disease and that we have
not known about it, " Dr. Seeff said. "We are seeing the tip of an iceberg."

Dr. Alter said, "According to this study, once you get it, you can't get rid of
it."

Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood and shared needles, but, Dr. Alter
found in her study, about 40 percent of people who become infected say they
never used drugs or were exposed to infected blood. It may also be transmitted
through sexual intercourse, researchers say, but if it is, the likelihood of
getting infected that way is very low. "We've never been able to figure out how
all these people became infected," Dr. Dienstag said.

The only treatment for Hepatitis C is with the immune system hormone alpha
interferon, but just 25 percent of patients respond without relapsing. The
treatment requires six months of injections three times a week, costs about $75
a week and has unpleasant side effects like flu-like symptoms, fatigue and
irritability. Although liver functioning improves in those who respond to the
alpha interferon treatment, Dr. Alter said, it is not known whether the
treatment eradicates the virus.

In her study, Dr. Alter used antibodies to the hepatitis C virus and a
sophisticated molecular test, polymerase chain reaction, to look for the virus's
genetic material in the blood of 106 patients who had been infected with
hepatitis C in 1985 and 1986. She and her colleagues found, she said, that "the
virus remained through the four years that we tested for it."

"We were able to detect it even in those patients who appeared to have gotten
over their infection," she said, adding, "We have to presume that if you have
the virus circulating in your blood, you are potentially infectious."

Dr. Alter said that she and her colleagues fully expected that the hepatitis C
virus, like the hepatitis B virus, would be gone when the patients' liver
functions were back to normal. "We were taken by surprise" by the finding, she
said.

In their study, Dr. Seeff and his colleagues analyzed data from five large
studies of the 1970's that had identified patients who had had blood
transfusions and become infected with what was later discovered to be hepatitis
C. The researchers tracked the patients who died and asked whether the cause of
death had been hepatitis C infections or other causes.

Dr. Seeff said he predicted that after 20 years the patients who were infected
with the hepatitis C virus would be dying at a faster rate. He said he found it
encouraging that his prediction was not borne out, although the hepatitis C
patients did have a higher death rate from liver disease.

"I don't believe this is a benign disease," Dr. Seeff said, adding that he was
now gathering data on the state of health of those who have lived with hepatitis
C infections for the past two decades and also was continuing to study death
rates for another five years.

"It may simply be a question of time," Dr. Seeff said. "It may be that as we
proceed, we will find that problems will develop and people will die of this
disease as time goes on."

Dr. Ira Jacobson, a hepatitis expert at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center, said he too did not believe that hepatitis C infections were benign.
Even if most infected people will die of other causes, some are devastated by
the virus, he said.

"I see so many patients who get in trouble with this virus," Dr. Jacobson said.
"We are seeing patients with cirrhosis and with liver cancer. We used to call
the cirrhosis of unknown cause, but now we recognize it's due to hepatitis C.
And we are coming to recognize in this country that liver cancer may more
commonly arise from hepatitis C than from hepatitis B."

But, Dr. Dienstag said, at the very least Dr. Seeff's findings "allow us to
breathe a little bit easier."

"Until now," he said, "we presumed that anyone with cirrhosis and hepatitis C
had a good chance of going downhill. But, in fact, there is a population of
people who do fairly well. We all feel this is encouraging."

Waterman brings A-game*;
*All-around, which describes the play of the Knights' 5-11 All-League center.

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD-8

LENGTH: 581 words


KETTERING - The separate elements in Meghan Waterman's basketball world have
finally converged.

The result is a more complete player who helped her Alter High School girls
basketball team to a 23-3 record, a No. 7 rating among the state's Division II
teams and a spot in the D-II state semifinals. The Knights plays Columbus
Mifflin today, March 6, at 3 p.m. at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center in
Columbus.

"I've always had a lot of people helping me with different parts of my game."
said the 5-foot-11 senior. "This year I feel like I've finally become a good
all-around player.

"The biggest difference between this season and other years is that I have a
good outside game on offense."

Waterman averaged 10.7 points per game for the Knights. Those numbers could be
much higher but Alter coach Chris Hart put the emphasis on good defense and
taking care of the ball above gaudy statistics.

"We have to be that way because the majority of our games are against (Girls
Greater Cincinnati) league teams who are physical and pressure the ball all the
time," said Hart. "If you average 10 points a game for us, it's like 20 points
for a team outside our league."

Despite the modest average, Waterman earned first-team honors on the GGCL Grey
Division All-League team and second team on the Associated Press Division II
All-Southwest District team.

Her ability to play defense, handle the ball, run the floor and rebound earned
her a basketball scholarship to Niagara University in Buffalo, N.Y.

The improvement in her perimeter game will give her more opportunity for playing
time as a college freshman.

She was schooled in the basics of the game by her grandfather, Ben Waterman, and
her father, Mitch.

Ben Waterman is one of the elder statesmen among coaches in Ohio with 60 years
of experience. He was an assistant coach at Ohio State under Fred Taylor as well
as coaching in the Cincinnati and Dayton public schools and at Central State and
Wilberforce Universities.

Mitch Waterman was the head boys coach at Dunbar High School for several years,
along with helping out with his daughter's younger age group teams.

"Basketball has always been big in our house," she said. "I can never remember a
time when I didn't have a ball in my hand or wasn't around the game."

When she got to high school, Hart and her staff put the emphasis on defense.
During the summer, numerous coaches from the Dayton Lady HoopStars AAU program,
especially John Coffey, helped hone her rebounding skills.

Waterman and several teammates also began training with Paul Manfredi in
Centerville to get stronger and quicker. "I can tell the difference in my
strength, especially in my legs late in a game," she said. "My jump shot is
still there and I can get after it on defense as much as I did in the first
quarter."

Her choice to attend Niagara follows a trend for area girls the last few years
to chose Division I mid-major universities. "If you play a lot of AAU, you know
by the time you're a senior what level you can play at in college," she said.
"The reason you're going to college besides the education is to play basketball.

"So why go to someplace where you're just going to sit the bench. I looked for a
school where I was comfortable (with the coach, players, style of play,
academics, campus surroundings) and felt like I could get playing time. Niagara
was a good fit for me.

"A lot of the girls I play with and against feel the same way."

The Bible as art

BYLINE: ARNOLD AGES; GAM

LENGTH: 501 words


Review by ARNOLD AGES
 THE Biblical literature which is Robert Alter's subject is the Old
Testament or what Jews refer to as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. Readers of
Northrop Frye's last two books will be familiar with many of Alter's
points, but Alter differs from the Canadian critic by virtue of his
absolute mastery of Hebrew and his reluctance to see Hebrew Scripture as a
mere typology for the New Testament.

According to Alter, who teaches comparative literature at the
University of California at Berkeley, the Bible is unique in its ability
to draw the reader "out of himself." It does this without trying
intentionally to entertain the reader even though there may be
entertaining aspects to the exercise.

One of the boldest arguments advanced by Alter is that the application
of literary principles to Bible study should not engender skittishness on
the part of the believer who, like C.S. Lewis, believed that literary
analysis derogated the spiritual essence of scripture. For Alter, the use
of literary modes in interpretation can illuminate the text in ways that
traditional Bible exegesis cannot.

In support of his thesis, Alter makes numerous forays into the Biblical
world and demonstrates quite persuasively that a stylistic analysis of the
psychological portrait of King Saul in 1 Samuel and the subtle sensuality
of The Book of Esther can bear rich fruit.

Alter displays a cultivated shrewdness by never overplaying his
literary hand. After positing the indispensability of a literary approach
to the Bible, he is quick to retrace his steps by showing how the Bible is
different from literature.

The anonymity of the Biblical author and the collective viewpoint
espoused in the disparate library of books which make up the Hebrew Bible
makes no allowance for "the self-promoting identity of the individual
writer or for the ephemerality of merely private experience." In the
Bible's "overarching unity of statement about God, history and creation,"
the literary devices used to promulgate these messages "are manifested at
a more microscopic level . . . than is common in other literary
traditions."

Even at the microscopic level, subtle literary techniques such as
narrative specification, literal meaning and allusive language play
important roles in expanding the allure of Biblical tales. Alter moves
comfortably from Genesis to Exodus, through Psalms and Proverbs, showing
how the original Hebrew of the Bible conveys nuances of meaning not
rendered in even the best of English translations.

The final chapter, "Scripture and Culture," examines the importance of
the Hebrew Bible in the context of modern culture. Alter explains that
trendy literary fashions such as deconstructionism cannot countenance the
idea that the Bible be taken seriously because it represents tradition and
authority. For those engaged in demolishing all canons, the Bible
represents the canon par excellence.

Surely that is reason enough to re-introduce the Bible in to the
curriculum.
 Arnold Ages is professor of French at the University of Waterloo.

Alter defense has taken a hit

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 229 words


KETTERING - Alter High School football coach Ed Domsitz dryly stated the
obvious:

"It has not been a good year for middle linebackers for the Alter Knights."

Starting middle linebacker Cody Conley broke a bone in his leg during Alter's
42-34 win against Genoa in the Division IV state semifinals.

A junior, Conley was an All-Southwest District selection who got the job during
Week 1 when Collin Boucher went down with a knee injury.

Fellow junior Chris Bockrath slides over into the position like he did when he
had 12 tackles against Genoa.

Conley and Boucher will be joined by seniors Ross Shively and Joe Kerns on the
sidelines for the D-IV state title game Friday, Nov. 28, against Steubenville.

Shively, a 5-foot-10, 190-pound defensive tackle, hurt his knee in a summer camp
and reinjured it before the season. Kerns, a 6-4, 220-pound offensive tackle,
has had back injuries that required surgery.

Their bittersweet journey ends with a 15th week of watching and not playing.

"They've been out here (at practice) all year," Domsitz said. "They just have
not had the opportunity to play because of their injuries.

"It's been their desire all along to stay with the team, to be part of the team
and offer and contribute whatever they could. That says something about them,
and it says something about their classmates and fellow seniors."

DATELINE: PALM COAST


PALM COAST - Former Flagler Palm Coast runner Jonathan Alter (2003) placed 19th
in the field and fifth on his team to help Florida Southern at the Early Bird
Classic hosted last week by the University of Tampa at a public park in Dover.

Alter, a senior on the Moccasins, ran 21:51 during the race, which was the first
of the collegiate season. Florida Southern was second to the University of
Florida at the meet.

Alter, the son of Dr. Dennis and Laurie Alter of Palm Coast, was a four year
starter for the Flagler Palm Coast cross country team and was co-captain of the
school's back to back state championship teams in 2001 and 2002. He also ran
distance events during the track and field season.

Two Warner Southern freshmen and FPC alums also placed at the Early Bird
Classic. Alex Russell earned points for the Royals by taking 35th in the field
at 23:24 and was fifth on the team. Chris Rivera ran 23:53 and was seventh on
Warner Southern in a non-scoring position (46th overall).

Russell and Rivera were both starters last year for FPC's Class 4A state
championship team.

Yet another Bulldog running alumnus, 2003 graduate Tina DeYoe, placed 23rd last
week for Presbyterian College (South Carolina) at the Lander Collge/Connie
Maxwell Invitational. DeYoe ran 23:20 for the Blue Hose, who placed third as a
team in the women's race.

DeYoe was a three-sport starter for the Lady Bulldogs in the early part of this
decade, playing basketball in addition to running cross country and track. She
participated with two state-qualifying girls cross country teams and qualified
for the state meet in track in her senior season.

Bullet exited jet at 8,000 feet Officials say the US Airways plane from Denver
was not in danger, but others disagree.

BYLINE: Joey Bunch The Denver Post

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-02

LENGTH: 378 words


Details of a gunfire on a Saturday morning flight from Denver began to emerge
Tuesday.

Federal regulators confirmed the pilot accidentally fired the gun in the cockpit
and the bullet exited the plane just beneath a window at roughly 8,000 feet as
the US Airways jet was on final approach to its landing in Charlotte, N.C., just
before noon.

"We're just not able yet to get into exactly what occurred, how the gun was
handled, before it went off," said Greg Alter, spokesman for the Federal Marshal
Service, one of the agencies investigating the incident. "It's just premature to
speculate."

Alter said the gun did not fire on its own. The pilot, who has not been
identified, is cooperating with the investigation, he said.

US Airways confirmed that the pilot had been taken off flight duty.

The pilot was in the left seat of the cockpit, and the bullet went through the
hull on his side of the plane, just beneath the window.

The pistol was identified Monday as a .40-caliber semiautomatic Heckler & Koch
USP, 28-ounce German-made handgun. Alter would not speculate on the duration of
the investigation but said that "it should be in short order."

Spokespeople for the government and the airline have declined to speculate on
what sanctions or changes in procedure might result from the probe.

Alter said the pilot had been suspended from a federal program that allows
pilots and crew members to be armed.

Agencies involved in the investigation have said the aircraft was never in
danger, but some aviation sources disagree.

"The hole from the bullet wouldn't bring down a plane by itself, but it can put
in motion a lot of bad things that could lead instruments to fail or pilots to
become wounded," said engineering contractor John Thomas of Littleton, who has
designed airplanes for combat duty. "I would not say they were never in danger.
I would say US Airways, the pilot and all the people on that flight were lucky."

The incident is believed to be the first gunfire in flight since security
measures were broadened to allow pilots to carry weapons in the aftermath of the
2001 terrorist attacks.

The plane, an Airbus A319, has been grounded during the investigation, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mike Fergus.

Alter has done what no other girls hoops team could do this season: Beat
Tippecanoe.

The Knights laid a 45-43 overtime knockout on the Red Devils in a Division II
regional final thriller at Vandalia Butler on Friday, March 13.

That moves Alter one game closer to defending its state title. Next up for the
Knights (24-2) is a state semifinal date with Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown
(19-6) at 3 p.m. on Friday, March 20, at OSU's Schottenstein Center in Columbus.

Tipp's magical season ends at 25-1.

A great small-ball boys showdown between New Knoxville and Jefferson seemed
impending. And perhaps they'll play ... next season.

Both teams dropped D-IV district finals Friday. Ada snapped New Knoxville's
49-game win streak 52-45 at Wapakoneta. Jefferson was bounced 63-61 by Lockland
at UD Arena.

Broncos fans unloaded on coach Art Winston afterward.

"For people to stand and boo me, they don't know me," Winston said. "They don't
know what I do for my kids."

On deck today

It's Centerville (20-3), the area's top-ranked D-I boys team, vs.
Trotwood-Madison (20-3), No. 2 in the area. Don't forget that Elks coach Jim
Staley used to coach at T-M. Or that coach Mark Baker is in his first season
with the Rams. Oh, the drama.

These GWOC heavyweights didn't play during the regular season. That makes
everything, including a trip to next week's regional, at stake in their 11 a.m.
D-I district final at UD Arena.

It'll be the first of five district finals there.

The third time could be you know what for Fairmont's girls.

The Firebirds (22-3) meet three-time defending state champ Cincinnati Mt. Notre
Dame (24-1) at noon in a D-I regional final at Wright State. MND has already
hung two losses on Fairmont. The winner advances to next week's state tourney.

Centerville also has landed in the state hockey final four. The Elks meet Toledo
St. John's at 4 p.m. in a state semifinal at Nationwide Arena in Columbus. The
final is at 11 a.m. Sunday.

Alter girls relay team medals in state track for fifth straight year

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

SECTION: KETTERING AND OAKWOOD; Pg. RD-12

LENGTH: 476 words


Alter kept a tradition going at the state girls high school track meet June 6-7
(Friday and Saturday) at Ohio State's Jesse Owens track in Columbus.

The Knights were second in the Division II 3,200-meter relay. It was the fifth
straight year a foursome from the school has made it to the podium in that
event.

The team consisted of senior Hilary Esselstein, freshmen Ashley Rodgers and
Rebecca Esselstein and junior Catherine Crisler.

Getting a medal was especially meaningful for Esseselstein. She had been on
3,200 teams that were state champions her junior year and fifth as a sophomore.

She also got to share the experience with her sister, Rebecca, who is a
freshman.

Esselstein had a good year, finishing third in the D-II state cross country meet
as Alter won the state title. She was also one of the five finalists for the Rae
Burick Women in Sports Award, which recognizes the area's top female athletes.
She is headed to the University of Findlay to run and compete on the school's
English-style riding equestrian team.

Alter came in fifth as a team in D-II with 32 points. Cuyahoga Valley Christian
Academy won the team title with 60, while Warrensville Heights was second with
43.

Other points came from Crisler (second in 2:16.81) and Rebecca Esselstein
(eighth in 2:18.96) in the 800 meters; the 1,600 relay team of Crisler, Rodgers,
sophomore Natalie Martin and freshman Jennifer Martin, who were sixth in 4:
05.6; Meghan Waterman (tied for fourth in the high jump at 5-feet), Megan Thuney
in the long jump (sixth at 17-feet, 1?-inch) and Holley Mangold (third in shot
put at 40-feet,?- inch).

The 800-meter relay team of Thuney, Rodgers, Natalie Martin and Jennifer Martin
qualifed to state, but finished seventh in their semifinal heat in 1:48.75. It
took 1.47.02 to make the final. Emily Zimmerman was 16th in the 3,200 at
12:45.87.

* The Oakwood girls tied for 19th in D-II with 10 points. The 3,200 relay team
of freshman Kelsey McDonald, sophomores Ericha Griep and Lucy Shafer and junior
Julia Sizek place seventh in 9: 43.45. McDonald was seventh in the 400 in 58.05.
Sizek was third in the 3,200 in 11:14.

Shafer qualified in the 800, but missed a medal by one place, getting ninth in
2: 19.84. She was also on the 1,600 team with McDonald, Griep and freshman
Hayley Basnett, which finished eighth in its semifinal heat in 4:11.92.

* Fairmont's 3,200 relay team had its second straight consistent outing to
finish seventh in Division I. The team of sophomore Andrea Kelsey. junior
Brittany Mefford, freshman Maria Meredith and senior Jackie Grimme ran 9:28.82.
They had run 9:26.54 in the regional to make state, but went 9: 44.73 in the
district.

"They've been up one week and down the next," said Firebirds coach Pat Miller

Alter too much for Tipp again;
Knights making third consecutive trip to state final four.;

Alter's Ty Markoff dribbles while Tippecanoe's Cassidy Wasson defends in Alter's
54-39 Division II regional final victory Friday night at Springfield.

SPRINGFIELD - Already an established inside presence and a dominator on defense,
Alter's Hayley Combs wanted to perfect the next best thing in her game.

She hasn't been dubbed the Knights' Mad Bomber, but she sure could be.

"I've been working on my threes lately and I've had a lot more confidence,
especially this year," said the 6-foot senior after making four 3s in a 54-39
defeat of Tippecanoe in a girls high school basketball Division II regional
final here Friday night.

"We wanted to make a statement. Everybody underestimated us after our seniors
graduated last year. We had to prove to people we were still the same team."

Alter won't match last season's 30-0 Knights who cruised to the D-II state
championship, but this version is drawing ever closer.

Alter (26-2) earned its third straight D-II state final four by eliminating Tipp
for the second straight year. Alter will play Columbus East-moor (22-4) at 6
p.m. in Thursday's state semifinals at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center.
Eastmoor advanced by edging Millersburg West Holmes 44-43 in the final seconds
also on Friday.

The other D-II state semi will pit Ottawa-Glandorf (25-2) against today's winner
between Shaker Heights Hathaway Brown and Elyria Catholic. Glandorf advanced by
beating Toledo Rogers 48-46 on a last-second shot.

The state semifinal winners will play for the D-II state title at 2 p.m. on
March 12 also at the Schott.

Alter blitzed the Red Devils early and maintained its dominance throughout.
Senior guard Kara Stephenson hit three first-quarter shots, including a 3 that
Knights coach Chris Hart attributed to Tipp abandoning its zone defense.

Then Combs took over. She had eight points in the second quarter, three
3-pointers by halftime and scored a game-high 19 points. Braxtin Miller added 16
points, including 13 in the second half, and Libby Bazelak added 10 points.

That was enough firepower to end Tipp's season again. The Knights hammered the
Red Devils 64-33 in last year's matchup of unbeatens.

"It's been quite a ride for these kids the last three years," said Hart, whose
Knights are 85-3 in that span. "We have a lot of juniors and seniors that have
been here the whole time.

"This is a really difficult region. There's a lot of good basketball here in the
Southwest (District) and it's a real credit to our kids, persevering all year
long, to have a chance to get back here and then to finish it like that."

Tippecanoe (22-6) was paced by Sammie Rowland's 10 points and two 3s.

"Alter is a top-notch squad," first-year Tipp coach Andy Holderman said.

"We just couldn't get over that hump. That's a quality program and the better
team won."

Alter players celebrate their 50-47 comeback win over Toledo Rogers in the
Division II state semifinals Thursday in Columbus.

COLUMBUS - They're all way too young to know anything about disco, but for much
of the first quarter of the Division II state basketball semifinal at the
Schottenstein Center on Thursday, the Alter girls gave new life to an old-school
classic.

"Le Freak" was a big hit for a band called Chic in the late 1970s. And it was
the perfect sound track for the Knights' start against Toledo Rogers.

"We were all freaking out," junior guard and top scorer Emma Bockrath said.

Although they had come into the game unbeaten, having outscored their 28
opponents by an average of 30.5 points, the Knights short-circuited at the start
of this one.

"We had heard a bunch of media talk about how great they were - how they had six
D-I players and were big and athletic - and I think that contributed to us being
a little scared and not believing in ourselves," Bockrath continued. "The
pressure, the energy of the crowd, all the emotion - we just got too nervous."

Although Rogers came in 24-4, three of its losses had been to schools from
Ohio's biggest division and the other was to the eventual Louisiana state
champion in a holiday tournament in Florida. As for the NCAA D-I prospects: two
underclassmen already are committed to Michigan and older players are headed to
the Miami RedHawks, Lamar and two to Eastern Michigan.

With the old "freak out!...freak out!" disco tune pounding in their pysches, the
Knights started off shaky. Their first three shots were blocked. None of their
first seven field goal attempts touched the rim and three other times they
turned the ball over.

Quickly, Rogers was up 9-0.

"Right then that was the best feeling in the world," said Rogers superb guard
Sasha Dailey, an EMU recruit who led her team with 10 points. "We were at Ohio
State, playing aggressively, feeling real confident."

Teammate Jasmyne Smith, who'll play for Miami next season, agreed: "We came out
with the mindset we had to play defense to get into their heads ... and
obviously we did."

Bockrath didn't disagree: "I was kind of depressed how we were freaking out. We
weren't used to being down and people were hanging their heads and getting down
on themselves."

Chris Hart, Alter's co-head coach, said she shared a thought on the bench with
assistant coach Rochelle Meinking: "A couple of times I told her, 'We just need
to score that first basket and then everyone will settle in and relax and we'll
be OK.'"

Hart was right - barely.

Bockrath finally hit a driving layup with 3:19 left in the quarter. She was
fouled in the process and made the free throw, scored another basket inside 25
seconds later and another with 1:35 left after a Rogers bucket.

Alter trailed 15-9 at the end of the first quarter and was down 30-22 after two
periods. It was the team's first halftime deficit all season. The game was
knotted 36-36 after three quarters and then came the shot that finally proved
disco is dead.

Alter's Mattie Bazelak rebounded a Braxtin Miller miss, crossed under the basket
and flipped a perfect shot backwards - "I work on them in practice," she later
grinned - to give the Knights a lead they did not relinquish.

Still, the Knights were only assured the 50-47 victory when the 3-point heave a
few steps from midcourt by Rogers freshman Breylnn Hampton-Bey was off the mark.

The Toledo guard fell face-first and lay there in anguish until Alter's Hayley
Combs gently helped lift her up.

Meanwhile, Bockrath and Miller hugged at mid-court, not just in celebration of
the team's 29th straight victory, but in relief they hadn't just been handed
their first defeat.

The Knights now play Millersburg West Holmes for the Division II state crown
Saturday morning at 10:45.

"I would just like to commend the Rogers team, they played really well," Alter's
co-head coach Kendal Peck said. "So much is made of the winner and the loser,
but it was a one-possession game and if one shot had gone the other way, we'd be
on the other end of this.

"One possession is the difference between heartbreak and celebration. That's
sports. And that's why we play."

One person who knows about perfection is Hart.

The last time the Alter girls put together a long unbeaten string was in the
1979-1980 season. They finished the regular season unscathed and lost in the
regionals. The coach was Theresa Check and the senior point guard was Hart.

Bazelak, who finished with nine points and eight rebounds, said at the start of
the game Hart told the team something that resonated later: "She told us 'no
regrets' and that's how we went out there and played. We gave it everything we
got."

When her team was faltering early on, Bockrath, who finished with a game-high 14
points, finally was able to grasp one galvanizing thought: "I knew someone had
to step up and make the first shot. Then everyone else would know they could do
the same and we'd settle down and start to be ourselves."

And who are the Knights?

They're a team, said Miller, that "wants the state championship soooo bad ... it
took us to all get together today and say, 'We refuse to lose this game.' That's
actually been one of our biggest quotes through the whole tournament: 'Refuse to
lose.'"

Before Thursday, the closest any team had gotten to Alter had been Carroll,
which lost by 12.

Afterward, Bockrath said her team, rather than withering on the big stage, had
actually grown:

"We learned you can't just look at a list of players who got offers to colleges
and assume they are a better team. The thing that makes you better is how you
play together. We ended up doing that today and you know we have the definite
potential to one day have six Division I players, too."

They also are one game away from a state crown and perfection.

In the end, Thursday, there was no disco.

And there were no regrets, either.

Alter names its first president;
Rev. James Manning is pastor at St. Albert in Kettering

KETTERING - On the recommendation of the Alter High School Board of Trustees,
Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk has appointed the Rev. James Manning as the first
president of Alter High School.

Manning, the pastor of St. Albert the Great in Kettering, said he welcomes the
opportunity to broaden his effect on the Christian community with this new role
of leadership in Catholic education.

"Having been involved in the Alter community for the past 18 years, I was
honored when the board asked me to consider being the first president of Alter
High School," Manning said.

"I believe the priesthood will empower my presidency and the presidency will
challenge me to be a more effective priest as leader in the Catholic community
of faith.

"Every assignment that I have had has been an adventure with the Lord and I look
forward to my work at Alter."

Manning, 57, was raised in Beavercreek and attended grade school at St. Henry
Parish in Dayton and graduated from Carroll High School.

He was accepted into the Archdiocesan Seminary Program at the Athenaeum of Ohio
and ordained a Roman Catholic Priest on May 31, 1975.

He earned master's degrees in philosophy and theology from the Athenaeum and a
master's degree in education from Xavier University.

Manning took on his first job at La Salle High School, where he taught religion,
was the chairman of the Religion Department, served as chaplain for the school,
coached freshman football and carried out parish responsibilities.

Manning left La Salle in 1988 to become associate pastor of St. Henry, and was
assigned the role of pastor at St. Albert the Great in 1991.

"As I have benefited from Catholic education all my life, I have a need to give
something back to Catholic education, and I am very proud to do so at Alter High
School," he said.

John Riazzi, vice chairman of Alter's board of trustees, said Manning's
appointment is an outstanding move for the school and community.

"(Manning's) enthusiasm and high energy level, coupled with his proven
leadership skills and strategic planning ability, give Alter the competitive
advantage needed to take the school, its students and families to the next level
in academics, community service and extracurricular activities," Riazzi said.

"More importantly, (he) is uniquely qualified to provide the young men and women
of Alter High School a living example of Christ-like behavior.

Dick Glennon, chairman of the board, added: "The Alter community is blessed to
have a man of Father Manning's character, education and experience at the helm
of our school at this critical time.

"We will look back at this and see it as a turning point in Alter's history."

Story of a Pahadi-American writer

BYLINE: Eunice de Souza

SECTION: VIEWS

LENGTH: 596 words


Stephen Alter lived under the assurance of Mussorie. His books trace a journey
inwards, towards the constants of beauty and peace

It's possible that the phrase Pahadi-Americans has been around for some time.
I've only just come across it in an interview with Stephen Alter who was born
and raised in Mussorie and continues to live there. Kamla Bhatt, who is based in
Silicon Valley and conducts an internet radio show says, "Stephen Alter is a
second generation Pahadi American, just like his first cousin Bollywood actor
Tom Alter."

The term could be extended to include the many writers, actors and artists who
live in the same area: Bill Aitken, Ruskin Bond, Victor Bannerjee, Shiv Sharma
(he now lives in Mumbai), and many others. Finally, however, it hardly matters
whether you are purple with yellow spots, as long as you write well.

Stephen Alter considers himself an atheist. But his fascination with the
Himalayas verges on the mystical. It is when exploring them that he finds peace,
beauty and meaning. In his latest book, Becoming a Mountain (Aleph 2014) this is
particularly true for him after a horrendous and pointless attack on him and his
wife Ameeta, by four masked men who broke into their home and knifed them
repeatedly. They demanded money despite the fact that Stephen Alter kept saying
there was no money in the house. Their attackers have never been caught.

The peak the Alters can always see from their home in Mussorie is Bandarpunch,
"a broad massif with twin summits rising 6,316 metres above sea level." When his
father died of cancer, his ashes were buried in the cemetery on the north side
of Landour ridge. Two uncles were already buried there, "on a terrace
overshadowed with deodar trees." "During our last conversation, on the morning I
left for Bandarpur," Alter writes, "my father could barely speak, though he told
me to be careful on the mountain. He was worried about my safety, even as he
faced his own mortality."

What is the meaning of mountains for us? Alter writes, "If we were to break down
our bodies into the basic elements out of which we are made, we would understand
that we are simply a resurrection of chemicals in the earth we tread. And the
ashes that remain after a cremation are no different from ancient carbons in the
soil. In turn, those carbons are reconfigured into an organic whole every time a
living plant or creature is conceived."

Alter faults mankind for thinking we are different from all forms of life on
earth - plants, animals, water, fire and so on. "We have dreamed up gods so that
we can reassure ourselves that somewhere, someday, somehow, after this life is
over, something awaits us: a presence that recognises who we are. But if we
approach a mountain instead, accepting that we are nothing more or less than an
integral part of its existence, our ego merges with the nature of the mountain."

Wordsworth writes some wonderful lines on the subject in one of his Lucy poems:

"No motion has she now, no force; She neither hears nor sees; Rolled round in
earth's diurnal course, With rocks, and stones, and trees."

I don't know how many people are likely to find these attitudes reassuring.
Death is frightening, the afterlife even more so. Is it blank and empty? Will
our friends, parents, relatives and pets be there? Life is empty enough without
them. Why should we suffer in the afterlife as well?

At the moment, my main concern is that I should outlive my two dogs. They are so
babyish even though they are seven and ten years old, that if I am away for ten
minutes they behave as if I was away for a century.

Indiana Supreme Court upholds Elkhart man's life without parole sentence for
murder

BYLINE: Ryan Jeltema, The Elkhart Truth, Ind.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 503 words


Jan. 30--INDIANAPOLIS -- An Elkhart man lost his appeal to the Indiana Supreme
Court last week asking for a lighter sentence after he brutally murdered his
girlfriend.

The court's seven justices unanimously agreed with a 10-page opinion that
Michael Shoun's sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole is
fair given the brutality of his crime.

The normal sentencing range for murder in Indiana is 45 to 65 years in prison.
Shoun claimed Indiana law barred him from receiving the harsher sentence due to
an alleged mental disability, but the justices disagreed that his disability was
proven to be severe enough to warrant a lighter sentence.

Shoun, whose 30th birthday was Sunday, was convicted in Elkhart Circuit Court of
brutally stabbing and mutilating his girlfriend, 17-year-old Tiana Alter, in a
bedroom at his sister's house in Elkhart, in November 2013. Shoun had walked
away from work release to stay with Alter, who had been taken in by Shoun's
sister, according to court records.

Court documents show Shoun and Alter were under the influence of K2, a form of
synthetic marijuana, when the murder took place. The drug made Shoun paranoid
and put Alter in a deep sleep, court documents say.

The Elkhart County Prosecutor's Office sought the life without parole sentence
based on two aggravating factors:

--Shoun was classified as an escaped prisoner at the time, after walking away
from the work release facility.

--The brutal nature of the murder, which included so many stab wounds on Alter's
body that medical examiners couldn't count them all.

An Elkhart Circuit Court jury convicted Shoun of murder in December 2014 and
recommended Judge Terry Shewmaker impose the life without parole sentence.

Shoun, who was 26 when he killed Alter, appealed directly to the Supreme Court,
claiming he had a mental disability before he turned 22, which is a factor that
would bar a life without parole sentence in Indiana.

However, the justices noted that Shoun passed two of three mental competency
examinations and the issue of his mental state before his 22nd birthday was
never adjudicated in Elkhart Circuit Court.

Shoun's defense attorney in circuit court had sought a hearing on Shoun's mental
state as a youth, but later withdrew his motion before the trial because he
believed the evidence gathered didn't support the claim.

In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Shoun asked the justices to declare him
mentally unfit for a life without parole sentence based on the evidence in the
court record -- including a consistently low IQ score and below average
cognitive function test results. However, the justices disagreed that his mental
condition met the standard for "intellectual disability" in Indiana law.

Shoun is lodged at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City and will remain the
prison system for the rest of his life unless his sentence is commuted.

Here is a roundup of some of the recent accomplishments of former Flagler Palm
Coast High School athletes who are now competing in college. CROSS COUNTRY
Florida Southern freshman Jon Alter (FPC Class of 2003) placed 76th Oct. 10 at
the Disney Classic conducted at the Walt Disney Wide World of Sports complex in
Orlando. Alter, a captain and member of FPCs Class 3A state championship teams
of 2001 and 2002, ran the 8-kilometer race in 27:42. He and his Moccassin
teammates were fourth out of a field of 28 teams in the university division.
Also at the Disney Classic, Stetson University got scoring performances from
Joey Matuszczak (FPC 2001) and brother Danny Matuszczak (FPC 2002). Joey placed
205th in 31:39, while Danny was 217th at 32:48. The Matuszczaks ran cross
country for four years and also won letters in track and soccer during their
years at FPC. Danny was a member of the 2001 state championship cross country

Independents on ballot face empty coffers

BYLINE: BY MATTHEW HATHAWAY Of the Post-Dispatch

SECTION: JEFFERSON COUNTY POST; Pg. 01

LENGTH: 518 words


On the same day that two independent candidates learned that their names would
appear on the ballot for Jefferson County's state Senate race, the Missouri
Ethics Commission released campaign-finance disclosures that show the sharp odds
the dark-horse candidates are facing.

On Friday, Jefferson County elections officials announced that Rep. Harold
Selby, D-Cedar Hill, and former sports broadcaster Christopher "Zip" Rzeppa can
run as independent candidates in the race to succeed Steve Stoll in the Missouri
Senate.

Campaign-finance documents released the same day suggest that the official party
candidates -- Rep. Rick Johnson, D-High Ridge, and former Republican legislator
Bill Alter -- have amassed campaign war chests so big that this race could
easily become one of the county's most expensive.

The documents, which cover campaign receipts and expenditures up to Jan. 19,
show that Alter had spent $63,568 and had $2,460 on hand, and that Johnson had
spent $45,706 and had $79,294 on hand.

Alter's biggest single expense was $46,139, which the campaign spent on
television commercials that have been airing for more than a week. Alter also
spent $12,600 for the salaries of eight campaign staffers.

Johnson's campaign reported paying $20,363 to a St. Louis phone bank, $4,048 to
a Washington campaign-consulting firm and $6,850 for the services of a
Washington polling company. Johnson also spent $5,146 for the salaries of two
campaign staffers.

In contrast, Selby reported spending $306 and having $2,244 on hand. His biggest
single expense was a $255 donation to the Jefferson County Library. Rzeppa said
he had no campaign-related contributions or expenses to file.

Selby said the campaign-finance disclosures show that only he and Rzeppa are
independent of party leaders and special interests.

"As the money starts flowing in (the Alter and Johnson) campaigns, people are
going to realize that the real power behind these candidates are the state
parties. They'll decide what their candidates are going to do if either are
elected," said Selby. He says he has kept his legislative seat since 1998
without ever accepting party or special-interest money.

Johnson campaign spokesman Shawn Borich disputes Selby's charge and says Johnson
has "a proven track record standing up to special interests." Despite Johnson's
money advantage in the financial disclosures, Borich said that Republicans
"believe this election can be bought."

Alter spokeswoman Cara Peroutka said the campaign needs its war chest to defeat
Johnson, who she said "is well financed by left-wing groups that do not reflect
the values of Jefferson County."

She said the Alter campaign is "working hard to level the playing field so the
voice of Jefferson County will be heard in Jefferson City."

Rzeppa said he can make up for his complete lack of funding by running a
political campaign that will be difficult for Jefferson County voters to ignore.

"I always liked horses that could come from behind," said Rzeppa, who will
kickoff his campaign with a press conference today. "But I can't afford to run a
boring campaign, and I don't plan to."

Alter makes regional final

BYLINE: By Ron Jackson Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 386 words


WILMINGTON - Alter looked state-worthy in shattering Cincinnati McNicholas's
Cinderella slipper Wednesday.

Playing in the Division II regional volleyball semifinals at Wilmington High
School, the Knights swept a feisty McNicholas 25-13, 25-18, 25-22. McNicholas
entered with an 11-15 record. The teams are Girls Greater Cincinnati League
rivals in the Grey Division.

Alter, 23-3 and No. 2 in the final coaches state poll, advances to the regional
finals Saturday at 4 p.m. and will play two-time defending state champ
Cincinnati Roger Bacon, who dispatched Washington Court House in the nightcap.

"We panicked against a seniorladen team like Alter," said McNicholas coach Denny
Murphy after his team tied Alter 18-18 in the second game. "Looking at Alter's
lineup, you can't say, we can take away No. 8 (Sarah Fisher) and we got a
chance. They're so balanced that they have four or five other girls that will
hurt you. They're No. 2 in Ohio for a reason."

Outside hitter Fisher led the Knights with 15 kills, followed by All-Ohio Emily
Borchers, who had an stellar all-around game with nine kills, four blocks and
two aces. Katie Laravie collected 12 digs.

The team's engine that sets the quick-paced offense in motion is setter Kacie
Hausfeld, who totaled 40 assists.

"We're so deep and we're playing 10 and 11 players every match," said Alter
coach Tina Jasinowski. "When we won our state titles, we played only seven. We
don't have the one or two players that have D-I coaches drooling, but we can
come at you in so many directions and these girls deliver."

Fisher looked formidable on the front row, especially when she teams with
Borchers and Hausfeld in the rotation.

"We're a focused team and confident because we know our potential," Fisher said.
"We thrive on the pressure and the high-intensity matches that will be coming
next."

Division IV at Vandalia:

Defending state champion Lehman Catholic (20-6) and New Knoxville (24-2) will
meet for the regional championship at 4 p.m. Saturday after semifinal victories
Wednesday.

Lehman lost the first game to Loramie 25-23. The Cavs came back to take three
tough games, 25-17, 25-20 and 25-23.

Emilee Seger had 55 assists for Lehman while Nell Paulus had 24 digs and four
aces. Sarah Lynch dominated at the net with 22 kills. For 18-9 Loramie, Bethany
Hoelscher had 19 kills.

Offensive miscues doom Alter against deep Blazers;
Hathaway Brown had answer for every Knights run, never losing lead.

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 395 words


COLUMBUS - Alter faced a formidable task in once again drawing Shaker Heights
Hathaway Brown, this time for the Division I girls state high school basketball
title.

Three of Brown's players are headed to D-I college hoops programs.

"Obviously, we don't have a lot of that skill," said Knights senior guard Ashley
Christie. "There's no one that sticks out on our team."

That low-key player profile has served Alter well, especially during its state
final four run the last three seasons. But as much as the many turnovers and
missed point-blank shots, that also cost the Knights in a 48-35 defensive
struggle with the Blazers.

Alter assistant head coach Kendal Peck nailed the Knights' frustration: "They
did to us what we do to people, a lot."

It was the third straight season that Alter was paired with HB in the state
final four, the last two resulting in season-ending losses. Brown (23-4)
successfully defended its state title and also was runner-up in 2007 and '08,
losing to Alter in that final.

The Knights never led, but closed within 28-27 late in the third quarter on
Courtney Christie's 3-pointer. The Blazers countered with a repeated dose of
Mylan Woods, their 5-foot-11 senior wing who's headed to Northwestern.

The All-Ohioan tallied nine second-half points and 16 overall to go with seven
rebounds, both game highs. She also ignited a 9-0 run to answer Alter's best
second-half shot.

"There's always been a lot of talk about me not being able to show up in state
games," Woods said. "I haven't really had my best games at state before, but
it's safe to say that I've had a pretty nice couple games down here."

Junior Erica Almady, who's committed to Miami, added eight points, and speedy
guard Alexis Dobbs (American University) five.

"We played against a very talented and deep team," Alter coach Chris Hart said.

"We needed a couple shots to fall, a couple breaks here and there."

The Knights (24-3) couldn't muster any of its winning formula that was so
evident in Thursday's 57-46 defeat of Washington Court House Miami Trace in the
semifinals.

Whitney Dabbelt led the Knights with eight points. Ashley and Courtney Christie
each added six, as did Allison Bockrath.

The Knights clanged 21 of their 34 shots (38 percent), and fared little better
in free throws (6-of-13).

"I don't think frustrating is the word," senior Ali Mygrants said. "It just
wasn't going our way."

Retiree expresses humor, views through poetry

BYLINE: HERE ABOUTS SANDRA BAER

SECTION: CENTERVILLE & WASHINGTON TWP.; Pg. RH2

LENGTH: 555 words


William G. McDonald Sr., 85, of Centerville, started writing poetry after his
wife died of pancreatic cancer in 1988. The retired educator now enjoys writing
and submitting poetry for awards.

"After my wife died, I decided that laughter was the best medicine, so I decided
to write humor," said McDonald, who quickly realized that poetry allowed him to
better express his feelings about life and his wife.

McDonald was born June 19, 1923 on Long Island, N.Y. in Farmingdale. He attended
the Marianist-run Holy Trinity High School in Brooklyn where he played
basketball and was class president for three years.

"I went to work in Manhattan," said McDonald, who had two brothers and four
sisters. "I worked as an office boy for a food broker, Aschenfelter and Morrow,
and was made traffic manager in one and a half years. I went from a little bit
of responsibility to a lot of responsibility. I had to go down to the docks
along the Hudson River and make sure that the merchandise was delivered from
places like Florida and California. George Morrow, one of the owners, was a
cousin of Anne Morrow Lindbergh."

In February 1943, McDonald and his brother went to the 59th Armory in New York
City to be inducted into the military. The Army sidelined McDonald because of a
heart murmur. Eventually he was accepted into the Navy. Following electronics
classes at Wright College in Chicago and Texas A&M in Texas, McDonald was sent
to Corpus Christi, Texas, for a more intense electronics program. From there he
went to Norfolk Naval Air Station in Norfolk, Va. followed by a short tour in
St. Charles, Mo. In August 1945, he returned to Corpus Christi to serve as an
instructor at the school that he had previously attended. After separating from
the Navy in April 1946, he worked for the city of New York as an assistant to
the secretary of Board of Estimate for nine months before leaving to earn a
degree in education at the University of Pittsburgh.

A position at the Gentile Air Force Station in Kettering brought him to the
Dayton area where he met his wife, the former Catherine Schopler, from North
Dayton. The couple went on to have four children. The oldest, Kathleen,
graduated from Archbishop Alter High School in 1953 and is married to Alter
classmate Paul Esselstein. The couple have two children and live in Ovido, Fla.
William McDonald Jr. graduated from Alter in 1955 and is married to former
Centerville resident Anne McMillin. The couple live with their three children in
Marietta, Ga. Tom McDonald is married with two children in Abilene, Texas.
Youngest daughter Mary McDonald attended college on a basketball scholarship and
was recently inducted into the Alter High School Hall of Fame. She teaches at
Miami University.

After working for NCR and Ash Equipment Co., William McDonald Sr. accepted a
position as a math and science teacher in the New Lebanon school district.

He later moved to the Dayton school district where he taught electronics classes
at Patterson Coop. He retired from teaching in 1978 and worked for Becker
Electric for three years before moving to St. Leonard Franciscan Living
Community in Centerville where he started his writing career with the Memoirs
Group under the direction of retired University of Dayton English instructor
Mary Sikora.

RIVERBOAT GAMBLING LICENSE HOLDS INTEREST OF BARGE OWNER

BYLINE: Tim Novak Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 907 words


SPRINGFIELD, Ill. - An Iowa barge executive who bailed out of a firm that was
rejected for a riverboat gambling license in East St. Louis is preparing to take
another shot at the license.  The barge company owner, Bernard Goldstein, ''is
certainly interested in applying for a license in East St. Louis,'' his
attorney, Larry Suffredin said Wednesday, one day after the Illinois Gaming
Board rejected an application from Goldstein's former partner.  Goldstein may
have competition from John E. Connelly of Pennsylvania, a riverboat operator who
also owns numerous vessels in St. Louis. Companies headed by Connelly and
Goldstein have riverboat gambling licenses in Iowa.  Connelly, who earlier
dropped out of the competition for a license in East St. Louis, said Wednesday
that he might now apply for one.  ''I will review all my options,'' he said in a
telephone interview.  Goldstein and Joe A. Terrell, a businessman from Baton
Rouge, La., were co-owners of Riverboat Development Corp. of Louisiana, which
wanted to operate a floating casino based on the East St. Louis riverfront.  But
Goldstein sold his half of the company to Terrell last Friday because gaming
board officials were preparing to reject the license application.  At a gaming
board hearing Monday, East St. Louis Mayor Carl E. Officer contended that the
license application was going to be rejected because board members believed
Terrell had paid him for the city's endorsement and access to the riverfront
land owned by Terminal Railroad. Gaming officials never made such an accusation
publicly.  Officer and Terrell both denied that a payoff had taken place.  ''Mr.
Goldstein had nothing to with anything Mr. Terrell was involved in,'' attorney
Suffredin said Wednesday. ''We felt that Mr. Terrell, because of his track
record in other businesses, would have been a good partner.'' Goldstein and
Terrell joined forces after Terrell had secured a lease for the riverfront
property, Suffredin noted. Goldstein also heads Steamboat Development Corp.,
which is based in Iowa.  Both Steamboat and Riverboat are subsidiaries of Alter
Barge Line Group, a major barge firm. Another riverboat gambling subsidiary of
Alter - Riverboat Development Corp. of Mississippi - received voter approval
Tuesday in Natchez, Miss., to set up a riverboat gambling operation there.
Goldstein was unavailable Wednesday for comment. But he said Tuesday that he was
still interested in operating a floating casino in Illinois.  The Illinois
riverboat gambling law, designed in part to help financially distressed cities,
earmarked one of five licenses for East St. Louis. The board gave preliminary
approval Tuesday for licenses in Alton, Galena and Rock Island, while rejecting
the bids in East St. Louis, East Dubuque and Savana.  The board held up a
decision on a license for Peoria, and it agreed to keep aside the license for
East St. Louis until a ''suitable applicant'' was found.  Terrell said he might
appeal the board's decision when he gets a denial letter from the board within
30 days. Any appeal is made to the gaming board and then to court.  If Terrell
appeals, Gaming Board Chairman William J. Kunkle Jr. said Tuesday, the East St.
Louis license will not be awarded to anyone until the appeal is resolved.
Officer said he would support any company seeking to bring riverboat gambling to
East St. Louis, including three firms that competed against Riverboat
Development for the city's endorsement. Those firms dropped out after the City
Council endorsed Terrell.  Officials from the two other companies, Little Trumpe
Enterprises and Sauget Enterprises, could not be reached for comment.  SOURCE:

Alter High School honor four alumni;
Fourth annual Hall of Fame set

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: SOUTHWEST; Pg. Z8-8

LENGTH: 448 words


KETTERING - Alter High School has selected four distinguished alumni for
induction into its 2006 Alumni Hall of Fame.

The Hall, in its fourth year, recognizes Alter alumni for outstanding
accomplishments during high school and following graduation.

This year's induction ceremony was held Feb. 3 at the Presidential Banquet
Center, 4548 Presidential Way.

Inductees included:

Rick Fersch Class of 1967

Rick Fersch worked his way up to CEO and president of Eddie Bauer Inc. after 14
years with the company.

But, in September 2000, at age 50, he suffered a severe stroke, threatening

not only his career, but his life.

Fersch resolved to change his life with God's help.

He received a phone call from the archbishop of Seattle asking him to become the
executive director of stewardship and development for the archdiocese.

Despite taking on the Catholic Appeal during a challenging time for the church -
both economically and publicly - Fersch has managed to increase contributions
annually.

Under Fersch's guidance, the archdiocese went from earning $8.8 million in 2002
to a recordbreaking $12 million in 2005.

Dan Graham, Class of 1974

With his bachelor of science degree in business administration and economics
from Heidelberg College, Dan Graham started in telephone sales with The Berry
Co. in Dayton in 1978.

His career with the company has now spanned 27 years.

Graham has held positions in sales, administration and management, including
area manager in Dayton and Milwaukee, division manager in Wisconsin, and
regional vice president for the Tennessee and Kentucky region.

Most recently, Graham was group vice president, responsible for Berry's
Independent Line of Business, Marketing, Internet and Publishing, and president
of the Berry Network, the company's national sales channel.

Dr. Rebecca L. Glaser, Class of 1975

Dr. Rebecca L. Glaser has treated hundreds of Dayton women diagnosed with breast
cancer and hundreds more for hormonal imbalances, which can be a precursor to
cancer and other ailments.

Glaser has worked as both a surgeon and a physician, and has become a very
popular breast cancer specialist.

Glaser retired as a surgeon in 2004 but maintains her practice and diligence in
helping patients with health and wellness issues.

Julie Pfeiffer, Class of 1980

Julie Pfeiffer began her career as an art teacher after earning her bachelor of
fine arts and master of arts in art education degrees from Miami University.

Pfeiffer

spent 15 years fostering creative expression in children at the primary and
elementary levels of education. In 2001, she founded Imaginattic, a creativity
studio for children ages 2-12 in Cincinnati. Pfeiffer serves as president and is
an educator at Imaginattic.

TSO Financial to Sell Card Receivables

                          December 10, 1987, Thursday

By A. JOSEPH NEWMAN JR.

DATELINE: HORSHAM, Pa.


TSO Financial Corp. is embarking on a restructuring program that will mean
substantially lower earnings next year, while avoiding the sale of the company,
chairman Dennis Alter said Wednesday.

Last February, the $1.3 billion-asset company, based in this Philadelphia
suburb, hired the investment bank of Kidder, Peabody & Co. to advise on methods
to raise capital - including selling the company.

The for-sale sign came down several months later. Instead, TSO, a direct
marketer of consumer financial services, is setting out to diversify away from
its heavy reliance on credit cards by concentrating on sales and securitizations
of card portfolios. The cards are handled by TSO's nonbank-bank subsidiary,
Colonial National Bank USA, Wilmington, Del.

Through September, TSO earned $9.9 million, or $1.09 a share, against $6
million, or 71 cents a share, on fewer average shares outstanding in the
year-earlier period. Most of the increase, however, reflected a net gain of 31
cents a share on the sale of credit card receivables in the third quarter.

Mr. Alter said he expected to complete TSO's first offering of pooled card
receivables - between $100 million and $150 million - "in a couple of weeks"
through First Boston Corp.

Mr. Alter said that while TSO expects significant income through additional
securitizations next year of credit cards and second mortgages, this will be
more than offset by:

* Sharply lower originations of installment loans. The company is toughening
credit standards and trimming solicitations for new card and loan customers. Mr.
Alter said loan solicitation mailings would drop from 12 million in 1987 to 1
million in 1988, and credit card mailings from 35 million to 30 million.

* Abandoning a start-up direct-response auto-financing venture via a network of
auto dealers.

* Higher loan-loss reserves, mainly reflecting an "anticipated worsening of the
national economy."

* The new Financial Accounting Standards Board ruling 91, which limits the
amount of loan origination costs that can be deferred.

* Higher costs of identifying creditworthy borrowers. Mr. Alter estimated
acquisition costs of $70 per account in 1988 versus $50 in 1987.

He said 1988 earnings will depend substantially on the amount of receivables
sold through securitization and on actual loan losses.

Community helps Alter create plan;
More than 200 people came out to assist the Kettering high school.

KETTERING - Students at Alter High School had a day off Friday, but the faculty
and staff spent the day working hard to create a vision for current and future
students, and for the school.

Alter also invited more than 200 members of the community to help them create a
strategic five-year plan at its convocation held Sept. 29-30.

"This is what this process today is all about," said the Rev. James Manning,
president of Alter, in his opening remarks.

"People with diverse backgrounds coming together to build a future for Alter -
to chart our course and put Alter on the map as the leader and on the cutting
edge of education for the future."

Last spring, Alter staff and faculty laid the groundwork for the convocation by
identifying nine planning areas and 40 challenges associated with the planning
areas.

Some of the planning areas were spiritual life, student life, technology, and
faculty and staff.

Members attending the convocation were assigned to small groups to explore the
meaning and challenges associated a particular planning area.

The faculty and staff planning area group included several Alter faculty
members, a chief of police, a superintendent of a public school district,
parents, a retired diocesan assistant superintendent and public school teachers.

Paul Zimmer, an Alter grad and local attorney, led the group as they explored
five challenges facing the faculty and staff.

After a day and a half, the group had to identify what they felt was the No. 1
challenge, and identify up to three solutions.

On Saturday, participants from the convocation gathered in the cafeteria while
each group reported on its No. 1 challenge, and possible solutions.

Each participant then voted for 20 of the 40 challenges, in a process called
multivoting.

The planning areas of student life, faculty and staff, academics, and
development and marketing received the most votes.

Frank Donaldson of the Institute of School and Parish Development in New Orleans
oversaw the process. He said his company has been working with Alter for the
past 10 months.

"This is great - the energy and enthusiasm," Donaldson said. "The facilitators
are doing a good job of engaging people in conversation."

Jennifer Butler, a faculty member at Alter, was enthused about the process.

"I think it's amazing - the community involvement we're experiencing," Butler
said. "The community is thinking of all the strengths, weaknesses, threats and
opportunities (of the faculty and staff planning area) that we never thought of,
which is the whole point. It's very valuable input."

After the convocation ended, Manning said,

"I know where my work is cut out for me and the board. This is my job
description. My job is to lead this school into the future. The people have
spoken."

Donaldson said his company will present their recommendations based on the
results of the convocation to Alter's board of trustees by November, and expects
implementation of some ideas before year's end.

Alter 15-0 after pulling away late;
Ashley Christie scores 17 points in matchup between two of area's best.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 323 words


KETTERING - Even on the bench, Alter High School guard Ashley Christie is trying
to influence the game.

"I'm up, I'm moving, yelling, 'Go, go, go,' " said Christie, who missed a large
chunk of the first half Monday, Jan. 25, after two early fouls. "I'm calling out
the other team's plays, just trying to help."

Then, like a veteran, Christie made her mark on the floor. The Knights senior
scored 13 of her 17 points in the second half and helped Alter to a 48-39 defeat
of visiting Fairmont in a matchup between two of the area's best teams.

The state's No. 1-ranked Division II team improved to 15-0 by outscoring
Fairmont 20-9 after taking the lead for good on a Christie 3-pointer with 3:26
left in the third quarter.

Including that shot, Christie scored 11 points in the game's final 11:26 to help
Alter to a rivalry win. She and the Knights also displayed savvy gained from two
straight appearances in the state semis.

"She showed a lot of leadership, a lot of poise," said Alter coach Chris Hart.
"And even more, I thought this was really a team win. We had a lot of kids step
up and do a lot of things we needed to have happen."

Senior forward Holly Carey scored 11 points for Fairmont (12-2), ranked No. 1 in
the DDN area D-I ratings, and University of Dayton recruit Cassie Sant added
eight.

Alter led 12-6 after the first quarter before Fairmont rallied to trail 23-22 at
halftime. In a stretch between the second and third quarters, the lead changed
hands on eight straight baskets, finished by Christie's 3-pointer to put Alter
ahead 30-28. The Knights never again trailed.

"We lost sight of the ball a few times late in the game, and they capitalized by
attacking the basket," said Fairmont coach Tim Cogan. "It was little detail
things like that."

Alter's streak faces another challenge Friday with Chaminade Julienne in a Girls
Greater Cincinnati League showdown.

Alter prevails in CJ rematch;
Rivalry lives up to its reputation as Knights stretch win streak to 10.

BYLINE: By Chick Ludwig Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 390 words


DAYTON - The rematch between two of the state's best girls basketball teams
didn't go down to the wire. But it wasn't decided until late.

When it ended, the Alter Knights got more than a victory. They got revenge with
a 53-47 triumph over the Chaminade Julienne Eagles at UD Arena in the 20th
annual Cage Classic sponsored by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati's Catholic
Education Collaborative.

Alter, the state's No. 2-ranked Division II squad, pushed its record to 14-1
(7-1) and winning streak to 10 since suffering its only loss to CJ in a 48-47
thriller on Dec. 15.

CJ, ranked eighth in Ohio Division I, fell to 10-6 (6-1).

"This is always such a rivalry game," said Alter coach Chris Hart, whose squad
overcame deficits of 14-4 and 25-16. "Anytime we can come out on top, it feels
good."

What felt so good for the Knights was sophomore guard Courtney Christie's
3-point swish from the right wing with 3:42 to go, giving Alter a 45-38 lead.

"That was huge," Hart said. "That allowed us to relax and play our game. Now we
were in control. You saw how they (the Eagles) came really hard at us at the
end. (Christie's trey) allowed us to weather that."

Christie's 12 points, four steals and two assists earned her player-of-thegame
honors along with CJ's Shene Fleming (19 points, 12 rebounds). Eagles junior
forward Samarie Walker also was a force (14 points, 11 rebounds). Then again, so
were the Knights' inside tandem of Whitney Dabbelt and Sandy Plunkett with 11
and 10 points.

The Knights are young - no senior starters - but they're deep and talented. They
share the ball and play relentless defense. Walker was held to two field goals,
but made 10 of 12 free throws and fouled out with 19.8 seconds to go.

"We had the determination that we were not going to lose this game," Christie
said. "Some of us had our struggling points, and when we did, our teammates were
there to make up for the times we weren't playing our best."

CJ led at the break, 26-25, and fought to within 48-45 with 1:17 to go. But
Alter sank 5 of 6 free throws the final 1:04.

"We had too many breakdowns again," CJ coach Marc Greenberg said. "Shene and
Samari played hard inside. They battled and worked. But when you give up points
against a good opponent, eventually you're going to get worn down."

FOOTBALL ALTER 28, CLINTON-MASSIE 0

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

Alter defensive lineman Antwann Martin Jr. beats a block by Clinton-Massie's
Jacob Treisch to greet ball carrier Jaycob Wolf on Friday night.

Alter running back John Bivens rushed for a touchdown in Friday night's D-IV,
Region 16 regional semifinal victory over Clinton-Massie at Centerville.

CENTERVILLE- Alter's run to the Division IV state championship game in 2014 left
an impression on the Knights' then sophomores. It would be their mission to
fulfill what those seniors couldn't.

"With our seniors losing in 2014, our motto is 'Leave No Doubt,' " said senior
quarterback Ryan Markoff following an impressive 28-0 shutdown of Clinton-Massie
in a Division IV, Region 16 high school football regional semifinal at
Centerville on Friday.

"We want to finish the business that they started when they lost in the state
championship. That's our goal. Before the season started in Week 1, we wrote our
goals and that was the first."

That's yet to be proven. What isn't in question is Alter has hiked its playoff
game to a new level.

Markoff did his part, firing a 42-yard touchdown strike to Justin "JP" Schimpf
in the first quarter and dashing 24 yards in the fourth quarter to complete the
scoring.

The defense, led by two-way standout linebacker David Rueth, was even more
impressive. Massie had just 92 total yards of offense and was shut out for the
first time since 2006, a streak of 132 games.

Rueth will be the goalkeeper when Alter (19-1-2) plays Columbus St. Francis
DeSales (18-0-3) in the D-II boys soccer state final in Columbus on Sunday.

"Going deep in the playoffs for football and soccer has been a dream come true,"
he said.

"It's what I dreamed of as soon as I said I wanted to play soccer this year."

The state poll champ, Alter (12-0) will play Cincinnati Wyoming (12-0) in the
regional final at a neutral site that will be announced by the Ohio High School
Athletic Association on Sunday. Wyoming advanced by eliminating Valley View
29-12, also on Friday.

Running backs John Bivens and Holden Rushing scored on short runs for the
Knights.

Massie couldn't recover from the loss of dynamic receiver Luke Richardson to
injury last week and linebacker and leading tackler Tyler Beam, who fractured
two vertebra in an auto accident. He's expected to make a full recovery.

"We just didn't have enough bullets," said Dan McSurley, Massie's coach for 21
seasons. "We got beat by a better team, but I'm here to tell you we'll be back
next year. We've got some very strong players coming back."

Massie had its best shot at scoring in the first quarter but a 34-yard
field-goal attempt was blocked. That seemed to deflate the Falcons.

Alter coach Ed Domsitz also lauded the Knights.

"They've answered the whistle every time," he said. "They have a lot to be proud
of. You're stepping up and it's a different level of football each week.

"These kids are physical and they did exactly what I asked them to do."

Alter's defense stymies Badin

BYLINE: Staff Reports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 419 words


If the Badin Rams felt like they were losing ground against the Alter Knights,
there was good reason.

Alter held Badin to minus-20 yards rushing in a 27-7 thumping in a Greater
Catholic League high school football opener on Friday, Sept. 18.

Alter's Cody Taulbee ran for three touchdowns for the undefeated Knights (4-0).

Justin Winters (14 carries, 77 yards), Taulbee (11 carries, 70 yards) and Matt
Hurtubise (11 carries, 51 yards) paced the Knights' ground attack.

Alter, which led 7-0 at halftime, completed just one pass for 4 yards.

"I'm sure Badin is going to give some people some headaches; they play good,
tough football," Knights coach Ed Domsitz said. "Our defense stepped up and made
some key plays. They did a great job of getting to the football."

Monroe 28, Bellbrook 21 (2 OT): The tough luck continued for the winless Golden
Eagles, this time in double overtime.

Bellbrook led twice in regulation - albeit by slim margins - and gave up the
tying TD with three minutes left in the fourth.

In OT, Bellbrook's Daveon Greene scored first and Monroe's Devin King matched it
with a 3-yard score. King's second 3- yard score put the pressure on and
Bellbrook couldn't extend OT.

Cincinnati McNicholas 17, Chaminade Julienne 16 (OT): CJ (2-2) scored first in
OT but missed the extra-point, setting up McNick's (2-2) win on the conversion
kick.

Sidney 21, Miamisburg 13: The Yellow Jackets' ground game pounded out 295 yards
and put the game away with a fourth-quarter TD.

Carlisle 41, Waynesville 33: Nick McGill scored on runs of 29, 12 and 6 yards to
lead 4-0 Carlisle. Seth Millar scored a pair of TDs for Waynesville (2-2).

Eaton 31, Brookville 6: The Eagles (3-1) are the frontrunners - literally - in
the SWBL Southwestern Division after this win. Senior Dalton Caudill rushed for
376 yards on 40 carries and put the game away in the second quarter with TD runs
of 14, 32 and 77 yards.

Dunbar 36, Belmont 11: The Wolverines (2-2) won their second straight to open
City League action behind Roger Williamson's 45-yard interception return and
Ralpheal Berry's 75-yard kickoff return, both for TDs.

Dayton Christian 49, Cin. Christian 27: Heath Harding made the most of his
carries - both of them. The freshman scored on TD runs of 78 and 63 yards for
141 yards.

Roger Bacon at Carroll, ppd.: The Greater Catholic League game was moved to 2
p.m. Sunday after as many as 22 Roger Bacon players had flulike symptoms this
week.

Roger Bacon athletic director Joe Corcoran said he was not aware of any cases of
the H1N1 flu.

Trotwood running back Raveion Hargrove has rushed for 1,562 yards and scored 21
touchdowns despite missing two games and part of another.

Raveion Hargrove made the D-III first team again.

Three Trotwood-Madison and Alter standouts in addition to three other area
players were named to the All-Ohio high school football first team Tuesday by
the Associated Press.

Making the Division III first team were Trotwood running back Raveion Hargrove,
defensive lineman Devon Smith and linebacker Kobe Vinegar. Joining the Rams on
the D-III first team was Piqua offensive lineman Nate Monnin.

Chosen to the D-IV first team were Alter offensive lineman Nick Busher,
linebacker David Rueth and defensive back Kyle Roshong, along with Dunbar
running back Tavion Thomas and Clinton-Massie defensive lineman Trey Uetrecht.

Perfect record has flaws;
Coaches set five goals beyond wins and losses for Alter.;
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL AROUND THE AREA

BYLINE: By Marc Pendleton

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 541 words


Alter High girls basketball co-coach Chris Hart (middle) guided the Knights to a
22-0 regular season, capped by their 68-39 defeat of visiting Thurgood Marshall
on Saturday.

Alter co-coaches Chris Hart and Kendal Peck have groomed a perfect girls high
school basketball season. But the Knights haven't come close to consistently
hitting game goals.

There are five goals that Hart and Peck challenge the Knights with; all are
tailored to that specific opponent. It's a combination of offense, defense and
everything in between.

They feel that helps the Knights stay focused, even when the outcome has long
been decided. Only twice has Alter succeeded in achieving those goals.

"We don't talk about the big picture, so to speak," Hart said. "We talk about
this game, then this game, then this game."

Fair enough. Leave it to others who follows girls basketball to debate today's
matchup of unbeaten Division II powers.

Alter (26-0) will play Clinton-Massie (26-0) in a girls basketball regional
semifinal showdown at Springfield High School at 8 p.m.. Kenton Ridge (25-1)
faces Columbus East-moor (20-6) in the 6:15 p.m. opener. The winners return to
Springfield in Friday's regional final. That winner advances to the state final
four at Columbus.

Both Alter and Massie are geared up for a state-title run, even if they're not
saying so. Alter was No. 2 in the final Associated Press state poll; Massie No.
3.

"If we don't look at what's right in front of us, we'll let it slide by,"
Alter's Emma Bockrath said. "We have to make sure we're focused on the next
task."

Massie is led by 6-foot-1 seniors Kasey Uetrecht (a Northern Kentucky University
signee) and Sydney Brackemyre (Louisville). Brackemyre dislocated a finger in
60-30 blowout of Tippecanoe in last Saturday's district final. A decision on her
status will be made today.

Alter lost to Massie in a sectional final last season.

? Balanced scoring has been the key to Kenton Ridge's success. The Cougars can
turn to Sydney Bates (16.3 points), Baylee Bennett (12.0), Stefanie Davis
(11.1), Sara Thornton (10.3) or Jamari McDavid (9.7).

"I think it's important because (Eastmoor) can't key on one girl," said Cougars
coach Ed Foulk.

In today's other area games:

? Stivers (13-9) vs. Ba-din (13-11), D-III boys district final, 6 p.m. at UD
Arena.

Former Thurgood Marshall assistant Shawn Mc-Cullough is the Tigers' fourth head
coach in four years. Led by the high-scoring Caldwell brothers - Robert and
Rodrick, both at 18 points - Stivers has a shot at a rare district title. Said
McCullough: "It's been many years."

Badin beat Purcell Marian to win its first sectional title since 2002.

? Anna (15-10) vs. Summit Country Day (20-5), D-III boys district final, 8 p.m.
at UD Arena.

Shelby County League members Anna, Fort Lo-ramie and Russia all alive in the
tournament. Summit won the 2012 D-III state title.

? Marion Local (19-5) vs. Upper Scioto Valley (22-1), boys D-IV sectional at
Wapakaneta, 8 p.m.

Midwest Athletic Conference rivals Marion Local, St. Henry and Delphos St.
John's are still playing. Local has won six of seven and cones off an
offensively challenged 27-23 defeat of MAC member Fort Recovery.

Tipp tops Alter in

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 413 words


WEST CARROLLTON - Carmen Seger is quite capable of taking direct kicks, but the
Tippecanoe senior picked a perfect time to defer.

Allowing fellow senior Brittany Campbell to take a direct kick with 12:54 left
in Wednesday's Division II Dayton regional semifinal, Seger and the rest of the
Red Devils faithful watched as Campbell found the back of the net for the
decisive score in a 2-1 win over Alter at West Carrollton.

Tipp, playing in its third soccer regional in four years, advances to Saturday's
final and will face Cincinnati Indian Hill, a 3-2 winner over Cincinnati
Wyoming, at Lakota West. Alter, the state's fifth ranked D-II team, ends its
season at 9-6-5.

The Knights were vying for their third regional final in four years.

The last time Tipp and Alter faced each other in the tournament, the Knights
took a 2-0 decision in the 2001 state semifinals. This time the outcome was
different thanks to teamwork.

"Carmen and I share directkick duties, and I turned to her to see if she wanted
to take the shot," Campbell said. "She said 'Go ahead, this is what we work
for.' "

"In warm-ups, we practiced kicks from that exact spot and she nailed two in a
row," Seger added. "She asked me if I wanted to take it, and I said 'No. You can
nail it again.'"

Campbell's goal came just 35 seconds after Alter tied the game on a penalty
kick. Instead of deflating after the Knights' score, the Red Devils responded
with Campbell's goal and stout defense. Although outshot 19-6, Tipp - and
sophomore goalkeeper Rachael Galemmo - repeatedly turned back Alter's advances.

The Knights had one first-half goal called back because of a push, and two
second-half shots hit the crossbar.

For the most part the game was played at the Red Devils' end.

the tying goal with 1:05 left.

each team had to be wearing a goalie jersey. None of the 11 players on the field

Alter will play for state volleyball championship

BYLINE: By Debbie Juniewicz Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B9

LENGTH: 505 words


The Alter Knights' quest for a state title began exactly a year ago when they
lost in the state semifinals.

They moved one step closer Saturday as Alter topped Roger Bacon 25-20, 25-10,
25-20 in the Division II semifinals of the Ohio High School Boys Volleyball
Association state tournament at Pickerington North.

"Last year, they came into the state tournament blind, they didn't know what to
expect," Alter coach Craig Erford said. "This year, they came in with high
expectations and a target on their back as the top-ranked team in the state."

The upset-minded Spartans took an early first-set lead but Alter fought back,
closing out the first set and controlling the second set with dominating
blocking.

"They have some really good jump servers and, I think, in the beginning, we
might have looked past this match a little," Erford said. "We took Roger Bacon
for granted."

Roger Bacon kept it close in the third set but Alter held on to get the win in
straight sets. Knights senior setter Keaton Pieper finished the match with 22
assists, six blocks and a pair of aces while junior middle hitter Chuck
Eisenhauer put in a balanced performance with 12 digs, eight kills, four blocks
and two aces.

The Knights are now only a single win away from the goal they have been focused
on for a year, but that won't come easy. They will face the defending state
champions in the D-II title match today at 2:30 p.m. Archbishop Hoban beat St.
Charles, 25-23, 25-27, 26-24, 25-20, in the other semifinal match.

DIVISION I: The Centerville Elks knew it would be a battle and they were ready
for it.

"The last two weeks, that's been our challenge," Elks coach Monte Mos-er said.
"At every practice, they were working hard and it showed.

Centerville put up a fight but it was St. Xavier, the No. 2 team in the state,
that prevailed, 28-26, 25-22, 25-23, in the DI boys state quarterfinals
Saturday.

"I told the guys, when you get out there have no regrets," Moser said. "If you
play your best and a better team wins, that happens. And we played one of the
best matches of the season."

Beavercreek bowed out of its first state volleyball tournament with a
straight-set quarterfinal loss to 2010 state runner-up Moeller in the final
match of the night, 25-15, 25-14, 25-14.

STATE TENNIS: The Centerville doubles team of Brad Boll and Ruben Geeraert
finished the state tournament as the top Dayton-area placers. The Elks duo
finished third in the Division I doubles with a 6-0, 6-1 win over Springboro's
Ryan O'Gara and Zach Berry on Saturday at Hilliard Davidson High School.

The Bellbrook doubles team of Jackson and Wyatt Heinz finished fourth in the
D-II doubles division and Tippecanoe sophomore James Trevino also finished
fourth after retiring in the third-place match to Cincinnati Country Day's
Patrick Wildman.

A pair of two-time state champions were crowned Saturday. Bishop Watterson
senior Chris Diaz claimed his second consecutive D-II singles title and Upper
Arlington's Billy Weldon and Stu Little won their second straight state D-I
doubles title.

Newsweek editor gives insider's view;
Journalist says election fiasco signals unstable political times

BYLINE: By ADAM JACKSON; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. D2

LENGTH: 634 words


BERRIEN SPRINGS -- Political journalist Jonathan Alter spoke for an hour at
Andrews University on Thursday without once using the phrase "pregnant chad."

No mean feat, considering the purpose of the lecture was to give the school's
students and faculty an insider's view of the chaos surrounding the recent
presidential election.

Still, Alter, who is a senior editor at Newsweek magazine and a noted political
analyst, regaled the audience of more than 300 students and faculty with his
take on the strange circumstances that led to the Florida ballot follies,
Supreme Court sessions, and hand vote counts that led to George W. Bush's
presidency.

Millie Das is the coordinator for Campus Ministries, the organization that
invited Alter to speak at the school. She said the hope was that the
journalist's lecture could serve to further political discussion among the
student body.

"We have students at Andrews from all over the world, and because of that, the
political process is a subject of much interest," she said. "We had actually
scheduled (Alter) to come speak in December, but the situation in Florida made
that impossible for him."

For most of the students and faculty in attendance, the lecture seemed to be
worth the wait. There were more than a few chuckles from the crowd as Alter
delivered a monologue liberally sprinkled with anecdotes and off-the-wall
comparisons.

Like his reflection on seeing President Clinton at the Democratic National
Convention, while the Broadway cast of "The Music Man" performed a number from
the classic musical.

"That's when it hit me: Clinton is sort of like our own Professor Harold Hill
from that production," Alter said. "He's a con man, but we all kind of like him
a little bit, anyway."

Another notable analogy came when the topic switched to the Florida Supreme
Court's role in the election. As part of his election coverage, Alter had a
front-row seat on the steps of the courthouse in Tallahassee when the court's
spokesman stepped out to tell the throng of journalists of the ruling approving
the recount.

"In 1975, I managed, as a college freshman, to get a standing room only ticket
to Game Six of the World Series," he said. "That was the game when Carlton Fisk
hit a home run that kept the Red Sox in the World Series.

"And that was the feeling when we heard of the ruling in favor of the recount.
No one knew if Gore would win, but we knew he was still in the game."

What no one knows, Alter said, is what lies ahead. While the changing of the
presidency is always a time of uncertainty, he said the confusion surrounding
the election seemed to be only the beginning of a particularly unstable time in
American politics.

As a political journalist, he didn't mind.

"We are all asking: What are those forces beneath the surface, and how will they
erupt over the next four years?" Alter said. "It is like we've stepped on a land
mine and heard the click, but it hasn't gone off yet.

"It makes political reporting interesting and compelling."

Interesting and compelling might have been a fitting description of the lecture
by some of the attendees on hand. Kelly Case, an 18-year-old first-year student,
said she appreciated the event for the candid look into the political scene.

"(Alter) gave some behind-the-scenes information we usually can't see," she
said. "I think it's interesting to take a look at politics from a journalist's
point of view."

Betsy Lindquist, 19, said the lecture filled in where classroom discussion on
the political process surrounding the election left off.

"We didn't discuss this much in class, and I was kind of interested in hearing
more about it," she said. "I followed the election, so I was looking forward to
this."

COLUMBUS - Advancing to another state championship game never gets old for the
Alter High School girls basketball team.

That's why its 57-46 defeat of Miami Trace in a rugged Division II state
semifinal Thursday, March 18, was so special.

"It's such an honor to be on a team to be at the top level every season," said
Ashley Christie, who combined with sister Courtney for 25 points to knock the
Panthers off their deepest tournament trail in program history.

Alter's win sets up a championship rematch with defending state champ Shaker
Heights Hathaway Brown at 2 p.m. Saturday, also at Ohio State's Schottenstein
Center.

Hathaway Brown broke from a 48-all tie with :39 left and went on a game-ending
5-0 run to beat Cuyahoga Falls Walsh Jesuit 53-48 in Thursday's first D-II
semifinal.

It'll be the fourth straight title game for Hathaway Brown (22-4), which knocked
Alter out in last year's state semis, 53-40.

Courtney Christie tallied 13 points, and Ashley Christie added 12 to lead Alter
in the final of four opening-day games.

Alter led by 10 points a couple times, but Miami Trace scored at the buzzer to
draw within 38-32 of the Knights after the third quarter.

Alter (23-2) scored the first seven points of the third quarter to go up 30-21.
Allison Bockrath knocked down a putback at the buzzer to give Alter a 23-21
halftime lead.

The Knights went on a 10-0 run to forge ahead, 17-7. But the Panthers (24-2)
nearly matched that, answering with a 9-0 blitz, and pulled even at 21-all
before Bockrath, a 5-foot-10 sophomore, hit her only first-half bucket.

Whitney Dabbelt scored nine points and beat the first quarter-ending buzzer to
give Alter a 12-7 lead.

Despite a spirited defensive effort from Kaila Howe, who also scored nine
points, Alter had no answer for Miami Trace senior Jenna Cobb. Headed to Butler
University next season, she had 21 points and nailed 9-of-15 shots to go with
six rebounds and three steals.

Cobb is the daughter of former Ohio State linebacker Glen Cobb, who teamed with
quarterback Art Schlichter to provide Miami Trace its greatest high school
football and basketball run in the late 1970s.

"Kaila's been doing a really good job throughout this tournament," said Alter
coach Chris Hart. "That's why she drew that assignment. (Cobb) can finish. She
was finishing over kids taller than her all night long."

Sunny start for Alter grad at Florida Gulf Coast

BYLINE: COLLEGE CONNECTIONS SEAN MCCLELLAND

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 527 words


Courtney Chihil seems to have made a bright choice accepting a scholarship to
play for the budding Division I basketball program at Florida Gulf Coast
University in Fort Myers, Fla.

But it's not all about the weather.

"I saw my breath for the first time in a long time," the former Alter High
School basketball and soccer standout said of her recent visit home to Tipp City
on break. "But I kind of miss the cold a little bit. The warm weather's nice,
but it didn't feel like Christmas."

The 5-foot-8 freshman guard is averaging 9 points and 5.3 rebounds with a
team-leading 19 steals through 10 games. In her collegiate debut, she had 14
points and four rebounds in a season-opening upset of No. 18 Florida, which has
not lost since, ripping off a school-record 13 consecutive wins.

"That was a rush," Chihil said. "Crowded house at our place, everybody storming
the court."

Chihil, leading scorer on Alter's state championship basketball team last
season, chose FGCU (10,000 enrollment) over the University of Charleston (W.
Va.), Findlay and a few others.

"I decided at the last minute," she said. "I liked the idea of kind of being a
little bit farther away. I was willing to try something new, I guess."

State title aside, Chihil's basketball exposure had been limited after a torn
ACL in each knee cost her a couple of summer seasons.

"She's pretty fortunate, I think," Gary Chihil, Courtney's dad, said. "Some of
these kids go off to college and don't get a chance to play."

The Lady Eagles, now 8-2, are coached by Karl Smesko, whose sixyear record
coming into this season was 154-29. Last season, FGCU went 22-8 and finished
second in the Atlantic Sun Conference. Still in transition from D-II, FGCU won't
be eligible for the NCAA tournament until Chihil's senior year.

Oh well. There's always Fort Myers Beach.

"It would be nice to go to the tournament," Courtney said, "but there are so
many other bonuses here that it's really not a big issue."

Another solid start

Add Kyle Corbin (Tippecanoe) to the list of college freshmen from the area
seeing extensive playing time - and starring - at low-profile schools.

Corbin, a 6-2 guard, starts for the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago
and, after 15 games, led the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference in
scoring, averaging 16.3 points.

No surprise to those who remember Corbin averaging 23.9 points and six rebounds
and sharing Central Buckeye Conference player-of-theyear honors as a Tipp
senior.

Campus tour

* Liberty University's women's basketball team is 2-0 since

Megan Frazee (Xenia Christian)

returned from a sprained ankle. In her first game back after missing eight,
Frazee had 23 points and 12 rebounds in a win over North Carolina A&T in the
Hokie Hardwood Classic. Then she scored 20, including the game-winning basket,
as LU beat Virginia Tech 45-43 in the final.

* Jeremy Shardo (Versailles),

a 6-foot-3 sophomore point guard, leads both NAIA divisions in assists,
averaging 7.9 for 11-2 Walsh University, ranked No. 15 in Division II.

Superheroes get the comic treatment in Alter Egos

BYLINE: BRENDAN KELLY, The Gazette

SECTION: MOVIES; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 770 words


You can't go to the multiplex this summer without bumping into a superhero. You
may have heard that Batman returns to the big screen this week in a little art
film called The Dark Knight Rises, Spidey was just seen in The Amazing
Spider-Man, and no fewer than four superheroes actually squeezed themselves into
the same film in The Avengers a while back.

Now you can add Fridge and C-Thru to that super-heroic list. They are the
down-on-their-luck superheroes front-and-centre in Alter Egos, New York-based
writerdirector Jordan Galland's smart, very funny deconstruction of the
Hollywood obsession with Marvel Comics-inspired moviemaking. The film will have
its world premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival on Tuesday night with Galland
and the actors Danny Masterson (of That '70s Show fame), Joey Kern, Kris Lemche
and Brooke Nevin on hand for the festivities.

On a conference call with Galland in N.Y.C. and Masterson in Los Angeles on
Wednesday afternoon, both said they grew up big fans of the whole comic-book
superhero culture. But Galland shied away from the notion that Alter Egos is a
critique of the whole Marvel-flavoured Hollywood zeitgeist.

"I didn't set out to do that," Galland said. "My inspiration was just to go out
and add some colourful costumes. It was more of a Pop Art instinct. But it turns
out it coincides with these big movies. I think that part of the appeal of the
film for an audience is to just enjoy superheroes without so much of the extra
stuff that Hollywood tacks on. So maybe it becomes a bit of a reaction to it,
but that wasn't my intention."

That's when Masterson jumps into the conversation from the other coast to give
his friend Galland some unsolicited advice:

"Jordan, I think your answer should be: 'This is my response to the sci-fi and
fantasy blockbusters,' " Masterson said. "That you've decided to come with Alter
Egos to say - 'Enough with you, Batman! And f---off, Spider-Man! Alter Egos is
here. I'm bringing you Fridge and C-Thru. I've had enough Christopher Nolan."

In his own quieter way, Galland appears not to disagree with Masterson's
hilarious outburst.

"It's in the title," Galland said. "It's Alter Egos. It's an alternative. It's
like alt-rock."

In this alternative universe, superheroes have fallen upon hard times.
Government funding for this heroic profession has dried up and even the public
has turned on them. Fridge (Lemche), who shoots deadly ice from his hands, is in
a funk - who wouldn't be - because his girlfriend is cheating on him - with his
civilian alter ego! His colleague C-Thru (Kern), who has X-ray-specs-like
vision, has captured bad guy Shrink (John Ventimiglia), who killed Fridge's
parents.

Our two heroes repair to an inn in The Hamptons to dispose of Shrink, which is
where their lives are complicated by the alluring innkeeper Claudel (Nevin) and
local cop Jimmy (Masterson), who is a wannabe superhero; the trouble is he can
only turn invisible for 2.3 seconds!

The good guys and bad guys all sport terrific monikers, including Truth Fairy,
Sunburn, Ice Scream and Electric Death, the latter played by Sean Lennon, an old
pal of Galland who also provided the film's inventive score.

Galland grew up fascinated by comic books. He says he'd have the school-bus
driver drop him off at the comic-book store on the way home. Across the country
in L.A., Masterson was immersed in the same culture - he finally got rid of his
comic-book collection in his late teenage years, though he did keep his
collection of The Punisher.

They both figure some of the folks who like movies like The Avengers and The
Dark Knight Rises could also dig Alter Egos.

"I think if they have any smarts they would," Masterson said. "If you're just
there to see things blow, if you're a big Steven Seagal fan, you're probably not
going to get it."

"I totally agree," Galland adds. "I think there's a lot there for superhero
fans. But it's not spectacle. There seems to be more and more of these superhero
blockbusters, so I think it almost becomes a language of itself. This tells a
story in that world that's not the story you see with every other superhero
film, hopefully kind of like the way Reservoir Dogs tells the story of gangsters
but from a different perspective than you've ever seen before. It examines (the
superheroes) as characters and has a lot of fun with that."

Alter Egos screens Tuesday at 7: 30 p.m. at the Concordia Hall Theatre. Tickets,
$9, are available at the Fantasia box office outside the Hall Theatre or via the
Admission network at admission.com

DOCTORS TO JOIN SHUTTLE CREWS TO MONITOR MOTION SICKNESS

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

SECTION: Section B; Page 12, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 729 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 21


A doctor will be added to two space shuttle flights next year to monitor the
crew and to find ways to alleviate what the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration calls ''space adaption syndrome.''

''You could call it 'space sickness' or 'space motion sickness,' '' David Alter,
a space agency spokesman, said today.  Astronauts have experienced nausea, loss
of appetite, drowsiness and cold sweats since the earliest days of manned space
flight, especially in spacecraft with enough room for them to move about while
in orbit.

''It's not so serious that you're incapacitated,'' said Mr. Alter.  ''It's a
malaise, not feeling well without specific complaint, perhaps a headache, the
nausea and appetite loss.''

Problem Could Become Serious

In some cases, however, astronauts have become so ill that they have vomited,
which could be a serious problem for someone in a spacesuit outside the
spacecraft.

A space walk scheduled for the last space shuttle mission in November was
postponed when William B. Lenoir became ill. The activity was later canceled
when two spacesuits malfunctioned.

Although monitoring of astronauts' medical condition has been an important part
of the space program, no medical doctors have flown on the five shuttle
missions. A medical doctor, Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin, was in the three-man crew of
the first Skylab mission in 1973.

Dr. Story Musgrave had already been scheduled to join the crew of the sixth
space shuttle flight early next year, but his duties, while not yet fully
determined, will not be related to studying causes and possible cures for the
illness, Mr. Alter said.

Crew Will Expand to Five

The physicians to be included on the following flights are Dr.  Norman Thagard,
who will be aboard the seventh flight, scheduled for next April, and Dr. William
Thornton, who will be on the eighth flight, in June. They will raise the size of
the crews to five, but no extensive alteration of the spacecraft will be needed.

''They are both mission specialists who will conduct medical tests and
physiological changes associated with space adaptation syndrome,'' Mr. Alter
said.

Dr. Thornton, 53 years old, a native of Faison, N.C., obtained his medical
degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  He has had
extensive conventional flight experience in the Air Force and was selected for
astronaut training in 1967. He was a physician crew member for a Skylab
simulation and was a support team member for the three Skylab missions. He would
be the oldest American astronaut to go on a space mission.

Dr. Thagard, 39, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., flew 163 combat missions as a
Marine fighter pilot in Vietnam. He earned his medical degree from the
Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas. He was selected as an
astronaut in 1978, receiving one year of training as an in-flight specialist on
manned spaced flights.

Focus on Neurological Areas

Mr. Alter said the doctors would focus on ''the neurological system'' during the
flights, but he said he was unable to give details. ''This will be an inflight
search for the countermeasures and to provide a more complete understanding of
space adaptation syndrome,'' he said.

The decision to add the two doctors was reached today, he said.  Officials said
the decision to add the doctors resulted from an inability to otherwise
determine the causes of the sickness.

''They had hoped they would have the answer before they sent a man out in the
spacesuit,'' Mr. Alter said. He said medical medical sensors on the astronauts
that were monitored from the ground and the use of several different medications
had failed to provide specific answers to the problem.

''It's about time we tried to solve this, expecially if we're going to fly as
often and also into extravehicular activity,'' he said.  Mr. Alter said about
half of the 12 men who have flown on the five flights of the space shuttle have
experienced some degree of sickness.

''They don't suffer this immediately,'' he said. ''It's not until the first or
second day, and usually they're O.K. by the fourth day.''

TRAINER HAS PUBLICITY IN HIS CORNER

BYLINE: John Crittenden

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 616 words


Trainer Happy Alter, an amateur boxer in his youth, is such an enthusiastic
fight fan that a sketch of boxing gloves is part of his racing silks.

That was never more appropriate.

One of Alter's former partners in the ownership of thoroughbreds,

Michael Dokes, fights Riddick Bowe for the world heavyweight championship

Saturday at Madison Square Garden.

And Alter spent much of January demonstrating that he still knows how to shadow
box, light enough on his feet at 48 to duck any question.

Alter didn't win a race last month. Horses from his barn ran 16 times

without a first-place finish. He had one second and three thirds.

But, because of D.J.Cat, his leading moneywinner of 1992, Alter was

still one of the most talked about trainers in Florida.

Although he has been consistently successful as a trainer, it is often

said that Alter makes more money from saw horses than race horses. He is a

partner in the ownership of South Florida's best-known traffic-control barrier
company, Bob's Barricades.

Alter does not seem to chase publicity. Perhaps that is why he gets so

much of it.

Joked Scott Savin, owner of Technology, "If Happy keeps getting this

much publicity for D.J.Cat, his horse could win the Eclipse Award at the end

of the year without ever going on the race track."

D.J.Cat is a 4-year-old colt owned by Alter and Bea Oxenburg. The winner of the
1992 Swale Stakes is undefeated and untied, but barely raced.

He ran only three times in 1992 but earned $100,000.

The Cat won by 10 lengths at Calder Dec. 24 although he had not raced

since March.

Alter said the colt would race in January at Gulfstream, either in the

Appleton Handicap or the Broward Handicap. "Definitely," Alter said. But

D.J.Cat has not appeared.

The Cat's feet have been a problem-- he races without shoes on his front feet.
Were there other difficulties?

"People have speculated about that but he has shown he can run,"

Alter said. "He just ran a race (on Christmas Eve) that left people in awe.

I think he will run until he is 7."

D.J.Cat's mother was Woo Wee, the filly who made Dokes and Alter

business partners. The fighter's name still appears in The Daily Racing Form

on those rare days when The Cat runs. Dokes and Alter are listed as breeders.
Alter said he was introduced to Dokes by Muhammad Ali. Dokes, 34,

trained at the Fifth Street Gym on Miami Beach in the early 1980s.

Seeking a tax exemption, Dokes said, he put up half the purchase price

of $30,000 on Woo Wee, claimed by Alter. A chipped knee led to surgery for the
filly, who was then taken to Ocala. Alter bred her to Hurontario, an obscure

stallion who had been a minor stakes winner in Canada.

Eventually, Hurontario was sold to an owner in South Dakota, to take up

residence in an outpost called Karlsruhe. Woo Wee was held in similar regard.
Dokes failed to pay his share of the farm bills. He bought the filly to race,
not breed, Dokes said. Woo Wee was sold for $500 as a broodmare for quarter

horses.

Long ago, Dokes gave up his claim to Woo Wee's offspring. Alter gets

the 11 percent split from D.J.Cat's Florida purses that is paid to the

breeder.

Alter eventually named a Woo Wee foal Honest Mistake as an indication

that there were no hard feelings between him and Dokes, the trainer said.

Dokes skipped other bills during the 1980s. He was out of boxing for 33 months,
part of that time spent in treatment for cocaine addiction and

alcoholism.

Alter points out that two of the winners of the 1992 Triple Crown races,
D.J.Cat's contemporaries, have been retired. The third, Lil E. Tee, who won

the Kentucky Derby, has not run since May.

"I haven't been cautious with him; I have been realistic," Alter

said. "I have the only undefeated 4-year-old stakes winner in the country."

HAWAIIAN SURF SPAWNS A WINNER

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: ROBERTS G

LENGTH: 411 words


OUTDOORS Hawaiian surf spawns a winner SAILING GREIG ROBERTS EARLY one
Californian summer morning in 1965 a young surfer emerged from the water, sat on
the beach and drew in the sand a design of what he considered would be a great
boat for surfing. The surfer was Hobart Laidlaw Alter, the boat the Hobie Cat
14. More popularly known as Hobie Alter, the surfer-turned-boatbuilder now has
in his range of catamaran designs the original Hobie 14, the Hobie 14 Turbo
(fitted with headsail) the Hobie 16 and the Hobie 18. The Hobie concept evolved
from the surfing movement of the 1960s. The surfers who travelled from the
States to Hawaii were fascinated with the Hawaiians' ability to surf their large
timber catamarans. It was a fascination people like Hobie Alter took home with
them. Alter was building surfboards during 1964 and it was a natural progression
to design and build a cat for surfing the beaches of his native California.
Although the Hobie 14(more than 100,000 sold) is now losing in popularity to the
larger Hobie 16, the 14 remains the benchmark for most modern catamaran designs.
At just over 148 kilograms, it features a wide beam and raised ""wing"
trampoline which elevates the skipper above the water. Having sailed a 14 many
times in still waters (not in the surf, thank you), there's no doubting their
speed. The H14 has been timed at a shade over 23 knots. Some years back in an
effort to update the H14, Alter added a headsail to the mainsail-only design.
Enter the Hobie 14 Turbo, a single-handed catamaran which features blistering
performance. I've watched Turbos sailing off Wellington Point and they are very
fast. The Brisbane agent for the Hobie range is Horton's Boathouse, Capalaba,
and according to Bob Horton, the Hobies, although still by far one of the most
popular off-the-beach designs, are in danger of being ""submerged" by the
current manufacturers who are now competing with their agents. ""The boat still
has such potential after 20 years that it's a shame to think that this may not
be reached," Bob said. ""The manufacturers, Performance Yachts, changed hands
some years back and the new owners see their role as both manufacturer and
retailer. That is not a good thing for any class of boat because it spells the
end of an established range of national dealers." The cost of the basic 14 is
$3763. The Turbo costs $4205 and a factory-made trailer can be had for $590.

Obama Nominee for Judge Could Be First Openly Gay Man on the Federal Bench

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 29

LENGTH: 680 words


President Obama has nominated a former Clinton administration lawyer to be a
federal judge in Manhattan; he could become the first openly gay man to serve on
the federal bench in the United States.

The lawyer, J. Paul Oetken, 45, is a senior vice president and associate general
counsel of Cablevision.

He is one of two openly gay men whose nominations are pending to the federal
courts. The other is Edward C. DuMont, a lawyer who has been nominated to the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.

Mr. Oetken was originally recommended to the White House in September by Senator
Charles E. Schumer, who described him as having ''sterling legal credentials''
and a ''distinguished career in private practice and public service.''

His nomination on Wednesday came about a year after Mr. Schumer recommended that
the president nominate Daniel S. Alter, a former assistant United States
attorney in Manhattan, who is also openly gay, to the same court.

But Mr. Alter was not nominated. He has said he believes it was because of
statements attributed to him relating to the use of the term ''Merry Christmas''
and to the Pledge of Allegiance, which he denied having made.

Senator Schumer said on Thursday that Mr. Oetken fit his three criteria for
federal judges: legal excellence, moderation of views and diversity.

''I am looking for people who fit the three criteria, and I was shocked to learn
there were no openly gay male judges on the entire federal bench.'' Mr. Oetken
''fit the bill,'' he added.

Mr. Oetken, a graduate of the University of Iowa and Yale Law School, was a law
clerk to Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun and worked in the Justice
Department and in the White House counsel's office.

Before joining Cablevision, Mr. Oetken was in private practice in New York.

If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Oetken, who lives in Manhattan, would fill the
slot previously held by Judge Denny Chin, who has been elevated by President
Obama to the federal appeals court in Manhattan.

Mr. Schumer declined to comment on the matter involving Mr. Alter, whose
recommendation he announced last February at a dinner of the Human Rights
Campaign, a national gay rights group. At the time, he called Mr. Alter ''a
brilliant attorney,'' adding that he would be ''a history-maker who will be the
first openly gay male judge'' nominated to the federal bench.

Mr. Alter, a graduate of Columbia and Yale Law, was an assistant United States
attorney and later national director for civil rights for the Anti-Defamation
League.

Mr. Alter declined to comment on Thursday, but told The New York Law Journal in
October that his nomination appeared to have run into trouble because of
''certain false attributions'' to him of statements that he denied making.

The Washington Blade had earlier reported that Mr. Alter, while working for the
Anti-Defamation League, was quoted in a news service article as recommending
against merchants using ''Merry Christmas'' instead of a more generic greeting
and in remarks in a magazine suggesting the group favored legal challenges to
the use of ''under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.

Mr. Alter told The Law Journal: ''Neither of the quotations attributed to me are
accurate or in any way reflect my personal reviews.'' The White House has
declined to comment on the issue.

Last summer, 66 of his former colleagues in the United States attorney's office
wrote to Mr. Schumer, urging the senator to fight for his nomination.

''We stress that if Mr. Alter's nomination were derailed by these false
allegations, the loss to the federal judiciary and to the public would be
significant,'' the letter said. The signers included two former United States
attorneys, James B. Comey and David N. Kelley; Mr. Comey was later a deputy
attorney general in the Bush administration.

Another of the signers, Gideon A. Schor, said on Thursday that the failure of
Mr. Alter to be nominated ''was crushing.''

''It was a real loss, I think, for the public and the bench and the lawyers and
the parties,'' he said, adding, ''For all of our sakes, I hope he gets another
chance.''

Race for Public Advocate Viewed for Mayoral Effect

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

SECTION: Section B; Page 3; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 797 words


The race for Public Advocate is not considered much of a contest -- the polls
put the Democrat Mark J. Green far ahead of the Republican-Liberal candidate,
Councilwoman Susan D. Alter -- but it is being viewed with interest because of
its possible impact on the mayoral race.

Mr. Green, the city's former consumer affairs commissioner, has had overwhelming
leads in every poll, and his election is considered a foregone conclusion by
most politicians and analysts. But his whirlwind campaign, in which he travels
the city in a blue van, could have additional impact because Mr. Green, a Jewish
resident of the Upper East Side, could persuade a number of voters disenchanted
with Mayor David N. Dinkins -- particularly liberal Jewish ones -- to vote for
Mr. Dinkins.

Ms. Alter, the Democratic Councilwoman who defected to Rudolph W. Giuliani's
Republican-Liberal ticket, is trailing badly in the polls. But as an orthodox
Jew and the only woman candidate vying for citywide office, she could draw some
conservative Jewish voters and women to Mr. Giuliani's camp, analysts suggest.

Drawing on Strengths

"Each one of these candidates is campaigning in part for the greater cause of
their ticket," said Eric V. Eve, a consultant not involved in the Public
Advocate race. "Each of them is trying to draw on their perceived strengths to
aid the top of the ticket. And to that extent, their race takes on added
importance."

As consumer affairs commissioner in the Dinkins administration, Mr. Green became
popular for calling attention to issues like price gouging in supermarkets and
home-improvement companies that deceived minority and elderly homeowners. And
after handily winning the Democratic primary for Public Advocate in a field of
six candidates, including Ms. Alter, Mr. Green emerged as the clear favorite in
the general election.

Traveling throughout the city, Mr. Green sells his ideas on the role of the
Public Advocate, packaged in what he calls "20 Ideas for New York's Second
Century," a hodgepodge of proposals he hopes to have in place by the time New
York celebrates the centennial of its five-borough status in 1998. They include
establishing a night court for small businesses and providing surveys of
community policing and the city's hospitals.

Ms. Alter, who came in third with 13 percent of the vote in the Democratic
primary, has begun an advertising campaign that has enhanced her name
recognition and placed her in double-digit figures in the polls. In the month
ending Oct. 18, she spent $328,000 on her campaign -- more than $250,000 of that
on television advertisements. That is more than three times what Mr. Green spent
in the same period.

Alter on the Attack

Her initial advertisements were intended to get the public acquainted with her,
and emphasized her disenchantment with the Mayor and her subsequent alliance
with Mr. Giuliani. But her most recent advertising campaign has hit hard at Mr.
Green, accusing him of not publicly criticizing the Dinkins administration's
handling of both the boycott of a Korean-owned grocery by blacks the
disturbances in Crown Heights.

But Ms. Alter has been criticized by some political analysts for being less
inclined to offer a vision of how she would function in office than to extol Mr.
Giuliani and attack both Mr. Green and Mr. Dinkins. When she does discuss
issues, she speaks about how the city's health-care initiatives, particularly
toward women, need to be revamped.

Her biggest problem is a lack of name recognition. "The fact is that Mark Green
has been a very visible, extremely well-known commissioner," said Maureen R.
Connelly, a political analyst not affiliated with either side in the Public
Advocate race.

Ms. Alter rarely if ever makes a campaign speech without prominently mentioning
Mr. Giuliani's name. Indeed, at some political forums, she has talked as much
about Mr. Giuliani as she has her own candidacy.

Ms. Alter said that as a member of a fusion ticket, the candidates can better
deliver votes to the entire slate by mentioning the other ticket mates as often
as possible. "The whole idea is to make Democrats feel comfortable crossing over
and voting for a Republican," she said.

In his campaign speeches, Mr. Green focuses primarily on his ideas for the newly
created post of Public Advocate, which was formerly known as City Council
president.

He has been forthright in his support for Mr. Dinkins, but in some appearances,
particularly in white areas outside Manhattan, Mr. Green will usually not
mention his endorsement of the Mayor unless asked.

"He's more popular in some places and I am in some other places," Mr. Green said
of Mr. Dinkins. "But I make it clear to anyone who wants to know that I
wholeheartedly support the Mayor."

Alter spikers win another state crown;
Knights defeat Roger Bacon for second straight title.

BYLINE: By DebbieJuniewicz Contributing Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C4

LENGTH: 295 words


CINCINNATI - The Alter Knights boys volleyball team didn't want to have any
regrets - what they did want was a state title.

Despite holding a 2-1 lead in the title match, the defending state champions
needed to regroup after dropping a hard-fought third set to Roger Bacon, 26-24.

"We talked about going for every loose ball," Alter coach Craig Erford said. "No
one wanted to think about what might have happened if they would have gotten
that one ball up."

Alter was fired up for the fourth set. An ace by state Division II Player of the
Year Chuck Eisenhauer gave the Knights a 6-1 lead and forced the Spar-tans to
burn a timeout. Alter never trailed as it earned its second consecutive Division
II championship with a 26-24, 25-19, 24-26, 25-15 win over Roger Bacon at the
Ohio High School Boys Volleyball Association State Championships at Moeller High
School on Sunday.

"We let the third game get away from us, so we really turned it on in the
fourth," Eisenhauer said. "We came out fast and we came out strong."

Despite taking the first two sets, Alter middle blocker Mitch Lush was not
surprised by his team's third-set loss.

"We've always had problems with the third set," Lush said. "And they (Bacon)
played really well."

But in the fourth set, the Spartans couldn't find a solution for the Knights'
balanced attack.

Eisenhauer led Alter with 19 kills while Charlie Schaefer and Lush added 13 and
11, respectively. It was a total team effort as libero Scott Morrison posted 18
digs and Nate Kinsella broke the school single-season assist record with 52 on
the day, bringing him to 783 on the season.

"Our goal was to beat everything we did last year," Lush said. "And I think we
exceeded expectations, even our own."

The Knights finished the season 24-3, a school record.

Legislators praise data base;
Text management system speeds political process

BYLINE: By Jean Bozman

SECTION: SOFTWARE & SERVICES; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 737 words

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ill.


When legislators stand on the floor of the Illinois House of Representatives,
they debate under the watchful gaze of portraits of Stephen Douglas and Abraham
Lincoln.

But the past is not all that is present. In between the portraits are two
12-foot-high computerized scoreboards that display a 30-character summary of a
bill about to be voted on, one of the more visible signs of the legislature's
text data base management system.

The text system was implemented by Legislative Information Services (LIS), a
group separate from other state MIS organizations. Originally called Alter and
now marketed under the name TextDBMS from Data Retrieval Corp. in Milwaukee, the
system is used in state agencies in Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas and a few
federal agencies. Except for the insurance industry, however, text management
has found few commercial users so far. The Illinois legislature system provides
an example of how the product can be used on a large scale.

Through a special software bridge, Alter is teamed up with IBM's IMS data base
management system to allow legislators to write and rewrite bills and track
changes to legislation before it becomes law.

The process is backed up by a special office called the Legislative Reference
Bureau, where 15 lawyers are able to query the DBMS to search for legal
precedents and draft new bills.

One of the strong points of the system, according to LIS deputy director George
Russell, is its ability to support the legislative process. "We've taken the
computer and adapted it to do what the legislators want it to do," he says.

Alter runs under IBM's MVS operating system, using VSAM sequential files to
store passages of text on an IBM 4341 or 4381 processor.

"Information is created once a bill is introduced on the floor of the House or
Senate," says John T. Hatcher, executive director of the 30-member LIS group.
"Once created, it is then tracked throughout the whole system by IMS. But
legislators actually write the bill using Alter."

The bridge between Alter and IMS allows changes to the laws to be recorded in
the IMS master files. The IMS system can report the status of a bill from
introduction to passage. Finally, the LIS computers drive a set of
photocomposition devices, which produces camera-ready copy of the law in its
printed form.

When the laws are ready to be voting upon on the House or Senate floor, an IBM
Series/1 minicomputer reformats the information from Alter for a 30-character
summation on the scoreboards.

On the floor of the House or Senate, the clerk may add notations to the
scoreboard by pressing a number of preprogrammed function keys.The keys bear
such labels as "motion to table" or "two-thirds vote required." The subsystem
was custom-designed by a South Dakota firm that also made the electronic voting
boxes on each legislator's desk.

"One of the advantages of this kind of system," says Stanley Johnston, executive
director of the Legislative Reference Bureau, "is that people are no longer
intimidated by paper. It's easy to let them do drafts and revisions of laws, and
we encourage them to revise the drafts we do for them."

Before the LIS started building the text management and voting system 15 years
ago, secretaries were faced with cutting and pasting by hand copies of revised
bills.  The typing pool has shrunk over the last decade from 10 to three typists
as electronic text processing diminished the text makeup work load.

The clerk of the House, Jack F. O'Brien, says he believes that Illinois was a
pioneer when it installed Alter on an IBM 370/168. The 370 used up its capacity
running the LIS work load.

But as the system evolved, legislators have grown dependent on its ability to
keep them up to date. Before it was installed, O'Brien recalls, "the Speaker of
the House would call a bill and start the voting while the representatives would
still be scrambling to find it in their papers." That no longer occurs, O'Brien
notes.

Even the executive branch has turned to Alter to simplify its work. During the
last four years, the LIS text data base system was used to compile a single set
of state codes for the entire executive branch including all state agencies. The
project was able to reduce a roomful of books to a set of five paperbound
volumes by eliminating repealed laws and duplicated ones.

"We used Alter to input all those rules into a single data base," LIS's Russell
says.

Special Olympics torch passes through Topeka on way to Los Angeles

BYLINE: Phil Anderson.

LENGTH: 480 words


Josh Alters has participated in Special Olympics for more than 30 years, but he
was never as thrilled to be part of the organization as he was this week, when
he served as the athlete ambassador for Kansas during the Unified Relay Across
America, a torch run leading to the world games this July in Los Angeles.

"This was awesome," said Alters, 38, of Topeka, who on Wednesday morning was
wearing a red T-shirt emblazoned with the Special Olympics Unified Relay Across
America logo. "It's a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to get to represent Kansas
for the world games."

Alters got to carry the world games torch Tuesday night in Topeka, running with
it from near S.W. 10th and Washburn to S.W. Huntoon and Washburn, a distance of
about a half-mile.

He also was on hand for the last leg of the local torch run, which was completed
about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday when Topeka police Sgt. Dan Wilson ran the last
half-mile, finishing near a Dairy Queen at N.W. Lyman Road and Topeka Boulevard.

The torch that passed through Topeka on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning was
one of three making their way across the United States, all carried by law
enforcement officers and Special Olympics athletes. By late July, all three
torches will have been in each of the 50 states.

Once they arrive in California, the three torches will be carried by law
enforcement officers through various cities before being part of the opening
ceremonies.

Topeka police Detective Kristi Powell, a longtime advocate for Special Olympics,
will be among law enforcement officers carrying the torch next month in
California. Powell said officers will run through about five cities each day
leading up to the world games, which will take place July 25 to Aug. 2.

"We'll be running throughout California," Powell said. "We'll be spreading the
word about Special Olympics and how great these athletes are."

About 7,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities representing 170 nations
will compete in 25 Olympic-type sporting events at the world games, including
swimming, soccer, track and field, basketball, weightlifting and gymnastics.

Among those who qualified for the event was Chevi Peters, 31, of Pittsburg, who
will compete in weightlifting. Peters said he qualified during competition in
New Jersey. His top dead lift was more than 350 pounds, he said.

"I'm going to have a blast," Peters said. "It's going to be awesome - it's going
to be great."

Also representing Kansas at the world games will be Cody Pierce, 24, also from
Pittsburg, who was one of 10 athletes from around the world selected to take
part in the final leg of the Law Enforcement Torch Run in Los Angeles.

"It's amazing," Pierce said. "It's just a great experience to be chosen. I'm
really thrilled to get to go."

After leaving Topeka, the torch was taken by law enforcement vehicles to
Lawrence. Later Wednesday, it was to go to the Kansas City area.

Centerville thins crowd for annual cross country meet

LENGTH: 558 words


When the Centerville High School boys cross country team staged its unique
Saturday Night Lights meet to open last season, the only drawback was the threat
of lightning.

The Elks hope for clear skies Saturday, when they hold the third annual meet
behind Watts Middle School, the only one in the area to be held in the evening
under lights.

With last year's event delayed once by lightning and a daunting forecast
threatening another setback, organizers were forced to lump two races together.

The 16 Division I teams competed with the 10 Division II and III teams, which
produced an overcrowded field.

Even with separate races on Saturday, Elks coach Jim Weckesser decided to trim
the number of teams. The intended result is a less congested course, which
should make it easier for fans to observe their runners.

"It was about like Woodstock," Weckesser joked about last year's event. "There
were too many teams and it was too chaotic."

Lighting the way for the 10 D-I and 10 D-II teams will be 12 portable 50-foot
towers as well as 30 10-foot work lights.

Lighting the way for the Elks should be junior Shawn Roberts, the top returner
from last year's team that placed sixth in the state.

The event, which begins at 5 p.m., will feature boys and girls from elementary
school through high school varsity.

The Centerville Stampede, the big event hosted by the Elk girls, will be Oct. 6,
beginning at 9 a.m. behind Watts Middle School.

Knights bring together state's best

Alter High School's girls soccer team didn't wait for the postseason to face
some of the best competition in Ohio.

The Knights teamed up with Middletown Fenwick and Metro FC to stage the Ohio
High School Girls Soccer Challenge at Delco Park in Kettering on Aug. 11.

The preseason event drew 18 teams, including state powers such as Dublin
Coffman, the Division I state runner-up last year.

Teams from Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Toledo also came to town.
Kettering Fairmont, Centerville, Beavercreek, Carroll, Chaminade-Julienne and
Springboro were the local teams represented

The one-day event allowed each team three exhibition matches. The level of
talent provided a measuring stick to start the season and offered a showcase to
college coaches.

Alter has stamped itself as one of the state's Division II powers for several
years.

Since 1995, the Knights have had consistent tournament success, highlighted by
two state runner-up finishes and two more appearances in the state semifinals.

Alter opens the regular season Saturday at home against Bay Village. Another
highlight includes a trip to Memphis for a tournament Sept. 15-16.

Head coach Jason Balogh returns for his seventh season.

The Knights finished 13-5-1 last year with their second straight district
runner-up finish.

Alter coach has state success

Alter senior Kathleen Glavin became the Knights' first female golfer to reach
the state tournament. But she's not the only individual with the program to
boast of state credentials.

Alter girls golf coach Doug Orange has coached the Brookville softball team to
the state semifinals in the past two seasons.

In his first season at Brookville in 2006, he led the Blue Devils to their first
state appearance since 1985.

This year his team made a return trip before falling to Bloom-Carroll, 6-1, in
the semifinals, to finish 25-6.

85-year-old man killed while recycling cans

BYLINE: By John Brewer and Mara H. Gottfried mgottfried@pioneerpress.com

SECTION: BREAKING; Dakota County; Minnesota-Twin Cities

LENGTH: 301 words


An 85-year-old Hastings man who recycled cans as a retirement hobby was killed
Thursday when he was hit by a skid loader at a St. Paul metal recycling company,
police said today.

Jack Patrick McCoy was unloading cans from the rear of his pick-up truck at
Alter Metal Recycling, 801 Barge Channel Rd., said St. Paul officer John
Keating, a department spokesman, when an employee driving the skid loader
accidentally backed into him.

Police were called about the accident at 1:39 p.m. Paramedics responded and
McCoy was pronounced dead at the scene, Keating said.

Neither drugs nor alcohol were believed to be a factor in the accident, police
said. Police did not arrest or cite the driver.

Bob Ellis, vice president and general counsel with Alter, said the company is
cooperating fully with local law enforcement and is conducting its own
investigation into the accident.

"First and foremost, we want to say it's a very unfortunate and tragic
accident," he said.

McCoy's family was still gathering information about the death this afternoon
and had no comment on the accident.

One of his sons, Kent McCoy, said his father retired years ago from 3M's
Chemolite plant in Cottage Grove, where he worked in the warehouse. He spent
part of his retirement collecting and recycling cans "as a hobby," his son said.

Every couple of months, he'd make a trip to Alter to drop off his booty, Kent
McCoy said.

He said his family was alerted to his father's death late Thursday afternoon and
is taking the news in stride.

"He was 85. I could think of worse things," he said.

Jack McCoy is survived by his wife, Betty, 81; six sons and two daughters.

Alter Metal Recycling's St. Paul site is one of five in Minnesota and one of 32
spread over seven other states: Alabama, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi,
Nebraska and Wisconsin.

Hundreds pay tribute to Hobie Alter at Doheny

BYLINE: BY LAYLAN CONNELLY, Staff Writer

SECTION: DANAPOINT; Pg. E

LENGTH: 289 words



HIGHLIGHT: Surf innovator is remembered at a Hawaiian paddle-out off Dana Point.



Hobie Alter had only one request: He wanted a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out
ceremony after he died.

In the blue waters off Dana Point and surrounded by surfboards and sailboats,
Alter's family on Friday released bowls filled with soil brought from Hawaii,
ocean water and sand from Waikiki Beach, and rock salt, which represented the
"purification of one's soul, body and life," said Eric Keawe, a "kahu," or
Hawaiian priest.

Surfers on boards hooted after a prayer in the form of a Hawaiian song,
splashing water to the sky and holding up paddles with the Hobie insignia. Boats
surrounded the group while an Orange County Harbor Patrol boat sprayed water,
creating a rainbow in the mist. Flowers floated on the water, and occasionally a
passing wave lifted surfers.

Hundreds of people paddled out in Alter's honor at Doheny State Beach, paying
tribute to a man who changed the way people use the water for surfing and
sailing. He is credited for transforming the foundation of a surfboard from
balsa wood to foam, and he went on to revolutionize the sailboat by creating the
Hobie Cat, a catamaran dubbed the "people's boat" because of its ease of use and
low cost.

Alter was part of a generation that defined what it meant to be a Southern
California surfer. He died March 29 at his Palm Desert home after a bout with
cancer. He was 80.

Well-known surfer and shaper Mickey Munoz remembers Alter giving him a job at
his shop in Dana Point, the first of its kind in Southern California. He did
ding repairs on boards for Alter in the early 1950s.

"I think his legacy is 'Have a Hobie day.' How better can you say it?" Munoz
said, referring to Alter's longtime slogan.

Alter's trip to state includes... belly-button piercings?;
Knights use piercing defense to defeat Patriots 49-37; must now fulfill
promises.

BYLINE: By Mark Gokavi Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 336 words


VANDALIA - The Alter girls basketball team got its regional title trophy. Now
the Knights will get fitted for rings - belly-button rings.

"We're going to the state and we're getting our belly buttons pierced," Alter
senior Nicole Christie exclaimed after the Knights' 49-37 win over Carroll on
Friday, Feb. 29, at Vandalia Butler's Student Activity Center. "It's a bet. If
we go to state, we all get our belly buttons pierced."

Alter coach Christina Hart clarified that statement. "They're on their own for
that," she said. "The deal was for me to get one."

The Knights (23-3) play Columbus Mifflin (21-3) at 3 p.m. Thursday, March 6, in
the Division II state semifinals at Ohio State's Schottenstein Center. The state
title game is at 10:45 a.m. Saturday, March 8.

"Unbelievable," Alter's Courtney Chihil said. "There's no words for it. It's one
of the best feelings."

Carroll (20-6) led 21-19 at halftime by dictating pace and getting to the
free-throw line.

"We wanted to play our game," Chihil said. "We were falling into what they did.
We wanted them to play like us in the second half - in-your-face defense and
playing quick."

Alter broke open a close game with a 17-6 third-quarter advantage.

It started with a Christie 3-pointer for a 22-21 lead - the game's eighth lead
change. Carroll tied it 23-all (the seventh tie) before Alter's sticky defense
converted several turnovers into scoring chances.

Chihil, who had a gamehigh 17 points, had nine in a 13-4 run. That coincided
with Carroll's Shante Jones picking up her second, third and fourth foul in a
span of 3:24.

"Nothing went right for those three minutes," Carroll coach Rob Berry said. "It
was obviously a major effect."

Jones (four points) sat much of the time and Carroll's Brogan Berry (13) and
Megan Lange (10) could only get the Patriots within nine points.

Alter makes its first state final four since 2002.

"It's a feeling unlike any other, really, kind of anxious, nervous," Christie
said. "You don't know what to expect. We're all excited, obviously."

Alter says despite his successes, Obama has a problem persuading the public to
come along.

BYLINE: SUSAN L. RIFE

SECTION: E; ARTICLE; Pg. E06

LENGTH: 552 words


Most surprising to journalist Jonathan Alter about President Obama's first year
in office was not the president's inability to shake up the entrenched political
bureaucracy.

Instead, it was Obama's failure "to connect to the American middle class and
convince them that he's really looking out for them. A lot of the power of the
presidency is the power to persuade. If you can't persuade, you've got a
problem," said Alter. "What was most surprising to me was we expected him to ace
communications and struggle in executive leadership, making the tough decisions.
Instead, what happened is he scored very well in doing things and inhabiting the
role of the president, and he struggled when it came to persuading the public to
come along."

Alter, the author of "The Promise: President Obama, Year One" (Simon & Schuster,
$28), will discuss the book and Obama's presidency at a Forum Truth lecture at
7:30 p.m. May 25 at Holley Hall in Sarasota.

For nearly 20 years, Alter has written a column on politics, media and social
and global issues for Newsweek magazine. His 2006 book, "The Defining Moment:
FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope," was a national bestseller. He has
covered seven presidential elections for Newsweek and is a correspondent for NBC
News and MSNBC.

Still, writing a book about the first year -- actually, he begins with the
transition period between the election and inauguration and continues through
the passage of the health care reform bill -- put "very intense deadline
pressure" on Alter.

"I was very intent on writing the first book on Obama's presidency," he said in
a telephone interview from New York.

"The Promise" combines the immediacy of daily journalism -- the reporting of
what happened on a day-by-day basis -- with perspective, analysis and history.
What that meant as Alter was doing his reporting was that his sources, who
included major players throughout the administration, from the president himself
through his staff, wouldn't necessarily want to tell Alter what had happened
that day.

"I realized fairly quickly that if I tried to report on events that happened
that day or that week, I would not be able to get the real story. I'd have to
circle back two weeks or a month later and then I could find out what happened,"
he said.

The book is absolutely jammed with names, dates, facts and figures as Alter
answers three questions: What happened, what is the president like and how well
did he do in the crucial first year.

Alter's conclusion is that despite the rocky year, made worse by partisan
fighting, Obama will ultimately stand alongside Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
Lyndon B. Johnson for his domestic achievements.

"I think if he'd lost health care, he would have been done domestically," said
Alter, who notes in the book that Obama went against the advice of everyone on
his staff in his pursuit of health care reform in the first year of his
presidency. "But having won on health care, he has plenty of chances to recover
on other issues."

President's Cup a huge success;
The annual volleyball tournament drew a record '196 teams from all over the
country and Canada.'

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

SECTION: NORTHWEST; Pg. Z6-8

LENGTH: 2215 words


DAYTON - The snow and temperatures made it hard for teams to get around, but
aside from that, the President's Cup volleyball tournament held Feb. 18-19 was a
huge success.

"This is the largest field we've ever had," said Howard Garcia of the host
Dayton Juniors Volleyball Club. "We had 196 teams from all over the country and
Canada. We had to turn away 76 teams because we didn't have enough court space.

"If we can find some venue in the area with the space to put down more courts
and has adequate lighting, seating and restrooms, there's no telling how big it
could get."

The event is one the largest regional competitions in the country for club
volleyball teams. It draws a large number of college coaches who are looking at
upcoming players from seventh to 11th grade and trying to find that overlooked
high school senior who hasn't signed. The Dayton Juniors had one champion in the
age 16-and-under club division, with five other teams placing in the top five
Divisional champions included: 18 Open: NKYVC Tsunami from Florence, Ky. 18
Club: Celtic Force Black from Chicago 17 Open: MAVA Elite of Louisville, Ky. 17
Club: Muncie 17-2 (Ind.) 16 Open: Team Z Navy from Cincinnati 16 Club: Dayton
Juniors White 15 Open: MAVA Elite 15 Club: MAVA Blue (Ky.) 14 Open: Team Z
Orange 14 Club: Muncie 14-2 (Ind.) 13s: Team Z Orange. The tournament drew more
than 6,000 players, coaches, parents and spectators.

Fairmont's Madison Layer (far left) battles Libby Bazelak of Alter for a
first-half header Friday, the opening night of high school soccer. Bazelak
scored Alter's fourth goal.

Fairmont subs watch Alter's three-goal first half."I told the girls there's no
shame in playing hard against a good team" coach Reade Faulkner said.

KETTERING - Nicoletta Anuci couldn't be blamed for feeling a bit woozy prior to
the start of what should be a promising high school soccer career.

"I was dying," the Alter freshman forward said before Friday night's season
opener at neighboring rival Fairmont. "Walking out of the locker room I said,
'Guys, I feel like I'm going to throw up.' I was so nervous."

Anuci overcame that all-world case of the jitters by collecting a first-half hat
trick and leading the Knights to a convincing 4-0 victory before about 1,500
specatators.

The contest was part of the Ohio High School Athletic Association's debut of
"Friday Night Futbol," and sponsored by the Columbus Crew SC. More than 150
participating varsity programs throughout the state were given two Crew tickets
to raffle off to fans.

Alter advanced to the Division II state semifinals in Javier Iriart's first
season as coach in 2011 and ventured that deep into the postseason again in
2013.

Both those seasons Alter opened with games at Fairmont. That wasn't lost on him.

"We're hoping this is a little bit of a trend," he said.

If Alter is to fulfill that potential, it'll need a lot more of the same
defensive play that shut down Fairmont. The Fire-birds were on the offensive
most of the night, but couldn't get a quality shot off.

Alter rarely advanced the ball past midfield in the first half, but when it did
the speedy Anuci was money. She struck first off an assist from Olivia Gillis at
the 35:35 mark. An unassisted goal came nine minutes later. Finally, with 20
seconds remaining in the half, she hit net with a 20-yard missile that Fairmont
goalie Madyson Perdue had no chance to stop.

"We knew coming in (Anuci) was going to be another player who added a dimension
to our attack," Iriart said. "With her speed and ability to finish in tight
situations, those are the kinds of things when you're looking at a dynamic
forward, she's got it all."

Senior Libby Bazelak scored with 12:17 left on an assist from Lauren Dietz to
complete Alter's scoring.

Fairmont was hit hard by graduation and starts a new back line. Third-year coach
Reade Faulkner knew the Firebirds would be up against a quality opponent.

"It's just difficult to plug all those holes," he said of graduation. "(Anuci)
was tough. She's awfully fast. We made some adjustments and at least she didn't
score their fourth goal. I told the girls there's no shame in playing hard
against a good team."

Most girls and boys teams that didn't participate in "Friday Night Futbol" will
open today.

DEALS & TRENDS: Inside Atlanta's commercial real estate market

St. Paul Cos. seeks space for insurance arm
The I-85 corridor is about to land the regional office of a Fortune 500 company.

St. Paul Cos. is looking for a home for the Atlanta offices of St. Paul Fire &
Marine Insurance Co., its U.S. property-liability underwriting operation. The
company is focusing its search on the I-85 corridor and the area around
Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in Gwinnett County, according to a request for
proposals issued to design and architectural firms.

St. Paul is seeking 80,000 to 100,000 square feet of space that will accommodate
450 to 500 workers, according to the request for proposals. St. Paul currently
has about 350 people working at Central Park near Perimeter Mall and in offices
in Tucker and Marietta. St. Paul, a public company with annual revenues of more
than $ 8 billion, wants to consolidate its subsidiary's Atlanta offices so its
employees can work together.

The company likely is considering space at Huntcrest, Technology Park/Atlanta
and Satellite Place. A location could be selected by year-end, according to the
request for proposals.

Russ Jobson, a Colliers Cauble & Co. broker who is representing St. Paul in its
search, declined to comment.

California-based telecom services provider UrbanMedia leases space in Alpharetta

The UrbanMedia lease at Brookside is a done deal.

The San Mateo, Calif.-based broadband telecom services provider has committed to
74,470 square feet at Brookside/100, said Michael J. Alter, president of Alter
Group. The Chicago-based firm developed the five-story, 127,500-square-foot
building at Brookside Concourse on Old Milton Parkway in Alpharetta.

UrbanMedia will move into the new space in the next couple of weeks. Alter's
ability to get the space ready quickly played a role in the company's decision
to lease the space, said Ridr Knowlton, a Jones Lang LaSalle broker who
represented the company with fellow Jones Lang LaSalle broker Frank Mann.
UrbanMedia will house 300 employees in the space, which will serve as its
National Operations Center. The center currently is on two floors at 200 North
Point Center East. The space ultimately will house more than 450 UrbanMedia
employees, Knowlton said.

Brookside Concourse's accessibility to and visibility from Old Milton (Ga. 120)
also attracted UrbanMedia to the site, said Todd Yates, senior vice president of
national development at Alter.

CB Richard Ellis brokers Rob Metcalf, Doug Guedry, Dave Watson and Gregg Metcalf
market space at Brookside Concourse on behalf of Alter.

DOWNTOWN: Equitable Building's price: $ 50.3 million

It's official: The Equitable Building sold for $ 50.3 million, according to
Databank Inc. That means Lincoln Property of Texas and financial partner ING
Real Estate paid about $ 87 a square foot for the 580,289-square-foot building
on Peachtree Street. The sale closed Nov. 2. Jones Lang LaSalle began marketing
the building, sold by LaSalle Partners and Nippon Landic, more than a year
earlier. The owners' target price was about $ 95 a square foot.

CENTRAL PERIMETER: Cingular Wireless moving into its base

Cingular Wireless has begun moving into its headquarters at Glenridge Highlands
Two at Ga. 400 and the Glenridge Connector. The new wireless phone company will
occupy nearly 320,000 square feet in the 20-story, 414,000- square-foot
building, said David Tennery, regional vice president of Tampa- based Hogan
Group, which developed the building. The accounting firm of Habif, Arogeti &
Wynne, which leased 49,000 square feet, will move to the building from Midtown
next month. As a result, there isn't much space available in the speculative
office tower. "It's the first time a building I've been involved with has been
98 percent leased when the (certificate of occupancy) was received," Tennery
said.

MIDTOWN: Upgrade helps firms with atypical hours

The three-story, 45,000-square-foot 828 West Peachtree Building is undergoing a
$ 1 million renovation. When completed, the upgrade will make the building more
appealing to companies whose employees work late hours or other than the typical
9-to-5 shift, said Lynn Carden, owner of I.J. Kapplin, which represents the
owner. "We're trying something a little different," she said. The building will
be equipped with a key-card system for security and special heating and cooling
systems for tenants who want to keep their offices open longer. The space will
lease for $ 18.50 a square foot. Up to 10, 000 square feet will be available in
January and another 15,000 square feet next fall, Carden said.

BROKERAGE: Adding more brokers goal of Grubb & Ellis

The growth spurt at Grubb & Ellis' Atlanta office isn't over. The company, which
has added several brokers in the past year, now has 32 advisers in its
Buckhead-based office. It soon will have 45 advisers, said John Orrico,
president of the Northbrook, Ill.-company's Real Estate Advisory Services Group.
Rick Lackey, who took over the Atlanta office as executive vice president and
managing director a year ago, has established a goal of having 50 brokers by the
end of 2001. "We made a major investment here in Atlanta," Orrico said during a
recent trip to check out the company's new offices at Atlanta Financial Center.
"There was a lot of talent here. What they needed was to be re-energized and
refocused." Orrico said Grubb & Ellis picked Lackey, a broker, to head the
Atlanta office because its local leader needed to understand the brokerage
business, which accounts for 83 percent of Grubb & Ellis' revenue. Lackey was a
top producer at Advantis and its predecessor. " My expectation is that our
managers are rainmakers," he said. Orrico expects the Atlanta office to greatly
increase its contribution next year to company revenues as a result of the new
hires.

NORTHLAKE: TechRX Inc. chooses Northlake Office Park

TechRX Inc. has selected Northlake Office Park as the location of its new metro
office. The company, which provides software for pharmacies, leased 15, 000
square feet at 2220 Parklake Drive in DeKalb County. It will move in next month.
TechRX's office will be staffed with former National Data Corp. employees. In
July, the companies announced that Atlanta-based National Data would merge its
pharmacy systems business into TechRX. As a result, TechRX needed space. It
picked Northlake because the park is near National Data's headquarters on the
Northeast Expressway and there is a good amenity base in the area, said Carla
Murray, a Cushman & Wakefield broker who represented TechRX with partners Andy
Ghertner, David Demarest and William Propst. TechRX signed a five-year lease for
the space, which will house a call center, Murray said.

TRENDS: Revision improves industrial outlook
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush could only hope for a
change in numbers as dramatic as the one CoStar Group is reporting for Atlanta's
industrial market. CoStar's initial third-quarter market conditions summary said
the net gain of occupied warehouse, distribution and business- service space
totaled just over 5 million square feet through Sept. 30. The report led to
predictions that the industrial market would fall well short of last year, when
the metro area recorded a net gain of 13.7 million square feet. Last week,
however, CoStar released revised figures showing that the industrial market
actually had a net gain of 9.5 million square feet through Sept. 30. Budge
Jamison, CoStar's Southern regional vice president, said a computer glitch led
to the initial inaccurate figures. The revised numbers mean the industrial
market is poised to top last year's performance.

facing Guerrero's pitch

fell and broke his right leg while catching a ceremonial first pitch from Angels
star Vladimir Guerrero to start yesterday's season opener against Seattle.

The 64-year-old former Colorado Rockies and Chicago Cubs manager will have
surgery on his femur today.

The ceremony featured the only two Angel greats who have won American League MVP
awards. Baylor won in 1979 and Guerrero in 2004.

Guerrero's toss was low and wide but Baylor made a stab for it, lunging for a
backhand grab. But he twisted awkwardly and was unable to get up. He was helped
off the field by the trainers and taken by ambulance to a California hospital.

@New Style Sheet;Surfing and sailing

pioneer Alter dead at 80

@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;Hobart "Hobie" Alter, who revolutionised
surfing and sailing with the first polyurethane surf boards and the small
catamaran known as the Hobie Cat, died over the weekend at his home in
California at age 80, his family said.

Alter, who started off making surf boards and ended up fashioning an entire
culture, died peacefully at his home in Palm Desert on Saturday. He was
surrounded by family, according to his website, Hobie.com.

The cause of death was not given but the Los Angeles Times said it was cancer.

A surfing buff from his early years, Alter started designing boards in the
1950s. At the time the material used was balsawood.

Along with his friend Gordon Clark, he invented the first boards made of
polyurethane foam. They were lighter and easier to handle and became an
immediate hit.

His shop Hobie in Dana Point south of Los Angeles became a hub for surfing
culture in southern California.

He did not stop there, going on to design small leisure catamarans called the
Hobie Cat.

Unveiled in 1967, the Hobie Cat 14 soon became the standard because it was so
light and easy to manoeuvre.- AFP

Alter celebrating 50 years of education;
School has planned variety of events to mark the occasion.

BYLINE: ByAdele Koehnen

LENGTH: 252 words


KETTERING - From Friday to Monday, Alter High School will kick off a year of
activities observing its 50 years of education.

Two other events preceded this official opening: an essay contest with a time
capsule ceremony and a birthday party honoring the school's namesakes: the late
Archbishop Karl Alter and Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton.

Members of the current Alter Marching Knights and the Lancerettes will be joined
by alumni of both groups at a 5 p.m. performance Saturday on the newly opened
practice fields adjacent to the school.

Todd Tucker, Alter band director, said that alumni are being asked to donate $25
for T-shirts and refreshments following the Friday-evening rehearsal and as a
gift to Phase II of the Capital Campaign for the Performing Arts.

All alumni also are asked to loan or donate memorabilia that can be displayed in
the main school lobby.

Committee heads Marlene Burr Orendor and Kathy Kinzler Mantia are asking for old
uniforms, play bills, football programs, photos or other nostalgic items.

A gala "A Starry, Starry Knight" is planned for Saturday, Sept. 22, at the
Ponitz Center at Sinclair Community College. Heavy hors d'oeuvres, dancing and a
silent auction will be featured.

The first inductee in the newly created Alter Teacher Hall of Fame is the
special guest, along with all Alter teachers, past and present.

Proceeds go toward building the Teachers Professional Enrichment Fund.

Principal retires with years of memories;
A reception will honor retiring Sister Katie Hoelscher, an educator for more
than 30 years.

BYLINE: By Joanne Clodfelter Contributing Writer

SECTION: KETTERING OAKWOOD; Pg. Z1-6

LENGTH: 460 words


KETTERING - Sister Katie Hoelscher will be retiring from Alter High School on
June 30, after more than 30 years of high school teaching and administrative
work in the Dayton area.

"I never planned to be an administrator," said Hoelscher, 68, the school's
principal. "There's a special thing about teaching. I loved the interaction with
the kids. As a principal, you have a completely different relationship with the
kids. As an administrator, you affect more people in a different way."

When Hoelscher entered the convent in the 1950s, she was pleased that her order,
the Sisters of Charity, asked her to be a math teacher, since she had always
loved math.

After teaching math at high schools in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Marion, she
came to Alter High School in 1972. After teaching at Alter for one year, she was
asked to be principal at St. Joseph's Commercial High School for girls, which
was located in downtown Dayton.

Hoelscher returned to Alter in 1974, and stayed until 1986, where she taught
math and was principal from 1981 to '86. She taught at Carroll High School from
1986 to '88. She then held leadership positions for the Sisters of Charity in
Dayton and in Cincinnati for 11 years.

While she said she enjoyed working with the Sisters of Charity, she missed
teaching. In 2000, she went to work in Alter's alumni office. In 2005, she
accepted the position of interim principal.

"I will miss the kids and the relationships with faculty and parents," Hoelscher
said. "One of the greatest blessings has been teaching the kids of the parents I
taught."

Alter is currently creating a long-range strategic plan to meet its challenges
of maintaining enrollment and remaining competitive with other schools in the
south Dayton suburbs.

"I still think Catholic education is viable," Hoelscher said. "I realize many
parents have to make huge sacrifices. I dream for the day every Catholic student
can get a Catholic education."

She said one of the biggest advantages of a Catholic school is the faith
formation. "We educate the whole person," she said. The school has several
students who are non-Catholic and several who use state-funded vouchers to pay
for tuition.

Nicole Brainard, who is currently vice-principal at McAuley High School in
Cincinnati, will take over as Alter's principal on July 1.

"I'm retiring from education," Hoelscher said. "I'm not sure exactly what I'm
going to do. I want to relax and catch my breath." She will be taking a year off
to explore her options and said she has no immediate plans to leave the area.

Esselstein paces Alter to district title;
Knights appear poised to take another shot at the elusive state championship.

BYLINE: By Ryan Hehr Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B9

LENGTH: 462 words


CLAYTON - When Alter senior Hilary Esselstein won Saturday's Division II
district cross country race in 18 minutes and 30 seconds, she looked like she
had finished a casual jog. She wasn't breathing too hard and there was no other
runner in sight.

She simply dominated.

Esselstein was nearly a quarter-mile ahead of the second-place finisher, her
teammate Ally Stover. As a runner, it can be hard not to let up when you're that
far ahead. But Esselstein has found motivation in an unusual place.

"I try to catch the Gator," Esslestein said of the golf-cartlike vehicle that
leads the pack of runners. "I just try to relax and not let my mind get ahead of
me and chase the Gator."

In the team standings Alter was just as dominant, scoring 26 points to
second-place Brookville's 78. The Knights appear to be well on their way to
their fourth consecutive state appearance.

"Before the race I told the girls, 'Let's make a statement and show that we're
ready to compete,' " Alter coach Matt Sableski said.

That statement has been made in the past, too. With three consecutive
second-place finishes at state, Alter has proved it can compete. They've just
never won a state title.

But with four of their top seven runners being seniors who have been to state
three times and never won, there may be an extra driving force this year.

"We deserve it." Esselstein said. "Our effort matches our results. With how hard
we've worked and finishing second three times, we definitely deserve it."

Olberding, Tigers win

Fort Loramie's Janel Olberding may have won the D-III girls individual race
(18:52), but Versailles got the hardware, edging Fort Loramie 61-62 for the team
title. It's the second time this season the Tigers have beaten the Redskins by
one point.

"I'm just happy to move on (to the regional meet)," Versailles coach Mark Leiman
said. "(Next weekend) our regional is going to be super tough. We got the top
four teams in the state at our region, and we know Fort Loramie's going to be
hungry."

Twins, Peters first

It was a tag-team effort once again from John and Walter Luttrell of Dayton
Christian. The twins dominated the Division III district 1 race (John in 15:52,
Walter 15:55), beating the field by 70 seconds. Russia (23 points) won the team
title.

Yellow Springs runner Andy Peters won the district 2 race in 16:51, leading the
team to its second consecutive title.

Sisters lead M-U

They may not be twins, but like the Luttrells, siblings Angela and Nicole
Klimkowski are the top two runners for their team. Both made the top five and
led Milton-Union to its third straight D-II district title (36 points) and fifth
straight trip to regional. Greenon's Jordan Stafford won the race in 19:05.

High scores in low-points league;
Alter's Ryan Siggins tallies 32 points against Purcell Marian and 26 points
against Chaminade-Julienne.

BYLINE: By Dave Long Staff Writer

Big numbers in the individual scoring column are rare at Alter.

Joe Petrocelli has had more than his share of capable scorers in 44 years as the
school's only boys basketball coach who might go off for 40 points.

But its hard fill it up when the opponent is playing physical bodyon-body
defense. Such is the weekto-week combat known as basketball in the Greater
Catholic League.

"In the last 20 years the winning teams in the GCL have only averaged in the
50s," said Petrocelli. "It's tough. You really have to work to get good shots.
So it's rare when you see anyone in the league having back-to-back games of 25
or 30 points."

Ryan Siggins, a 6-foot-5 junior, was able to put together a pair of highscoring
games for the GCL Jan. 26 and 27. He had 32 points in a win over Cincinnati
Purcell Marian on a Saturday night and 26 in a 54-48 win over Chaminade-Julienne
on a Sunday night at UD Arena which was part of the annual Cage Classic.

His 32 points in a GCL game are would probably translate to over 50 against
non-league competition.

Petrocelli, the state's second winningest coach with 750 wins, keeps records on
everything regarding Alter hoops. He was able to grab a folder within a minute
of the question and answer "Ryan is only the 23rd guy in Alter basketball to
score more than 30 points."

Through 17 games, Siggins was having an outstanding year by GCL standards. He
was third in the league in scoring a 16.4 points per game, first in rebounding
at 9.0 per and fourth in free throw shooting a 75 percent

The real significance of the 32 points is that it is a Siggins family record at
Alter. The Siggins family name has a deep-rooted tradition in Alter and
University of Dayton sports.

Ryan's grandfather, Frank, was a star football player at UD in the 1950s. His
father, Joe, was one of Alter's stars in the early 1970s as the Knights became a
state power. He went on to be a starter at UD. The most points Joe Siggins had
in high school was 31.

"I'll take it," said Siggins. "30 points games are hard to come by here (at
Alter)."

Siggins played well at times last year as Alter's only starting sophomore. He
has also shown flashes in AAU summer ball that be could be a Division I college
prospect.

"Joe didn't really start to become a real good all-around player until midway
through his junior year. Ryan is developing the same way," said Petrocelli.
"Last year Ryan was laid back because he was a sophomore with seniors.

"This year as the season has gone on, each phase of his game had gotten better
and better."

The one feature of Siggins game which has come to the fore is using his
quickness. "Coach Petrocelli and my father have been on me all season about
taking the ball to the hole and getting to the free throw line," said Siggins.
"I've got a quick first step. But I just haven't looked to drive that much.

"But I've been concentrating on doing that since our Christmas tournament (in
North Carolina) and its made a difference. I'm getting to the line and making my
free throws. Teams are playing off me more so they won't get beat off the
dribble. So that gives me more room for the outside shot or to find the open man
with a pass.

Maverick Morgan led Springboro with 24.7 points per game.

Joe Petrocelli, in his 50th and final season at Alter, was named co-coach of the
year.

Franklin's Luke Ken-nard, who averaged 28 points per game, shared player of the
year honors.

Luke Kennard of Franklin High School and Springboro's Maverick Morgan were both
named first-team All-Ohioans in boys basketball, with Ken-nard sharing state
player of the year honors by The Associated Press.

Alter's Joe Petrocelli was named a coach of the year.

The Division I and II teams released Monday were based on recommendations from a
statewide media panel.

Kennard, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, shared top player honors with Dan Monteroso (St.
Clairsville) and Vitto Brown (Bowling Green). Kennard averaged 28 points in
leading the Wildcats (19-4). He also was the team's leading scorer as a freshman
as Franklin posted a 20-0 regular-season record in 2011-12.

Morgan, a 6-11 senior, was a first-team D-I pick. He averaged 24.7 points and
led the Panthers to the regional semifinals, the deepest into the postseason of
any area D-I team. He has signed with the University of Illinois.

Petrocelli, in his 50th and final season as Alter's head coach, shared the DII
coach of the year honor with Doug Davis (Lima Bath), David Bargar (Chagrin
Falls) and Frank Spotleson (Canton South).

Petrocelli, the only head coach in Alter history, announced his intention to
retire midseason. The Knights have vowed to send their coach out a winner. Alter
will play Columbus Watterson in the D-II state semifinals on Thursday.

The only area second-team selection was Zack Denny of Valley View in D-II. The
senior led the state in scoring (35.0). He's signed with Bowling Green.

Seniors Mark Alstork of Thurgood Marshall and Alter's Jaaron Simmons were both
D-II special mention choices.

Vince Edwards of Middletown and Lakota East's Stedman Lowry were D-I special
mention.

The All-Ohio D-III and D-IV teams will be released today. Mr. Basketball will be
announced by the AP on Wednesday.

Baltimore-based The Jewish Times parent gets OK to exit Ch. 11

BYLINE: Ben Mook

SECTION: NEWS

The parent company of the Baltimore Jewish Times and two local magazines has
received approval for its Chapter 11 reorganization plan that will let it
continue to operate while paying creditors back over the next four years.

Alter Communications Inc. had filed for bankruptcy in April after the company
did not reach a settlement in a lawsuit by the H.G. Roebuck & Son printing
company of White Marsh over a broken contract. Under the deal, Alter will pay
Roebuck and other unsecured creditors 85 percent of its net cash through 2015.

Andrew A. Buerger, president of Alter Communications, said Friday the company
was able to come through the bankruptcy without affecting its publishing
business. He said Alter was also able to maintain its 40-person work force while
the bankruptcy case was being heard.

"This is the route we had to take to survive," he said. "No one likes to file
Chapter 11 - it's expensive, it's embarrassing and it's no fun. "

In addition to the Jewish Times, Alter publishes Style magazine, Chesapeake Life
magazine and a portfolio of custom publications. The Jewish Times, Maryland's
largest Jewish weekly publication, publishes on Fridays, averages more than 120
pages and has a paid circulation of nearly 50,000, according to its website.

The paper was founded in 1919 by David Alter, and Buerger took over the company
when his father, Charles A. Buerger, died in 1996. Andrew Buerger changed the
company name from Jewish Times Inc. to Alter Communications.

Alan M. Grochal, an attorney with Tydings & Rosenberg LLP who represented Alter,
said the plan means unsecured creditors like Roebuck will see about 15 cents on
the dollar owed.

The bulk of the payments from this net cash stream will be to Roebuck. Alter
parted ways with its longtime printer with two years left on its contract over a
price dispute. Last December, Roebuck responded with a lawsuit and was awarded
$362,000 for lost income and interest and had an additional claim for $1.2
million in damages still pending.

In addition to the lawsuit, Roebuck is objecting in the bankruptcy case to
Buerger and his mother being repaid for loans they personally made to the
company. Under the plan, they would be repaid with the other unsecured
creditors.

"If this were just about the money between Roebuck and Alter, we probably could
have gotten a deal done without going to court in the first place," Grochal
said. "But, there was a lot of bitterness between the parties, so it was not
just about the money.

Other creditors include the Baltimore Development Corp., which in 2002 loaned
the company $150,000 to relocate to the city from Owings Mills. Alter received
approval in October 2009 to suspend principal payments on the loan for two
years. The Jewish Times offices are located near the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall.
